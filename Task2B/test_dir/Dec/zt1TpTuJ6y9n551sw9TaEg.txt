Without a doubt, this is the best buffet in Las Vegas. Will definitely return for bottomless mimosas!
This review is for the Breakfast Brunch on 12/24 only - at Christmas pricing. We got here at about 1pm. And yeah... $42 a person... for brunch. There was nothing here that justified the pricing!. . I only had the Korean Kalbi, top sirloin, a slice of turkey, a cocktail shrimp in a shot glass, a piece of pork belly. And dessert. That's it! I didn't want anything from the omelet bar... It was past 2pm! Where's the seafood... The crab legs... Nothing! $42?! Serious?!
Our party of 4 came on a Saturday evening and was promptly seated. $47 per person is pretty expensive, but after all.. it is a Vegas buffet ina nice hotel. . . It's a really big area with a lot of tables that aren't stuck together like some other restaurants, which I enjoyed. I hate when I have to get in and out of my chair to get plates of food and always have to excuse myself to the person next to me! It was not that loud either, which was good. Our server was really nice and came every 5 minutes to check up on us for drinks or empty plates. They give you coffee in a huge mug and if you ask for tea, they give you earl grey breakfast with an adorable pot of honey.. . The food!: . They have an extensive selection of seafood, meats, and veggies. Cheeses, dips, olives, salads, salmon, fresh fruit, crab, slabs of bacon, sheperd's pie, paella, ribeye, meatballs, risotto, etc.. The ingredients used were obviously high quality, fresh, and cooked to perfection. I liked that though they had a smaller selection than other places, almost every dish was delicious. .  . However, the dessert area was a bit of a disappointment! French macaron was a mysterious orange color with a strange buttercream frosting-texture ganache; it was also crunchy and hard and broke as soon as I tried to grab it with the tongs. None of the tarts were good, they were all soggy and soft and either too sweet, or too bland. The redeeming factor was the chocolate covered strawberries and the little gelato bar.
Too bad. Never come back for $50 and nothing to eat at all. Meat is not good and not many different kinds to choose
This is the best buffet I ever been in vegas! My hubby & I are In love with this place! They have a huge variety of food, salad & dessert! Food are fresh & so yummy. Very nice atmosphere & great service. Desserts are delicious as food. You don't really want leave! Hehe ...we asked for tea after we filled our belly server came with two nice cup of mighty leaf tea witch Is my favorite & cute container of honey. I wish I could give them more than 5 star! I have to say thank you 4 your best service. You guys need more than 5 star! Excellent
This place has amazing food selections. My favorite part, of course, was dessert. I love their ice cream selection. . . I also loved the fact that their portions are small. I could sample a lot more plates and explore different flavors. . . The best time to eat here is during brunch. They offer such an amazing brunch selection and always have fresh fruits.. . To add the cherry on top, my husband is in the Air Force so we got a military discount. I believe the discount was 15 or 25% off the total bill. (Sorry, I'm not sure of the exact discount) . . Overall, this place has a relaxing modern flare, good food selections, and friendly professional service.
I love Wicked Spoon!. . They have a lot of unique dishes! I love the fact that a lot of the dishes were portioned out smaller, so I was able to try everything without getting super full! . . The bone marrow was awesome, just melted in my mouth. The little chinese take out boxes were not only delicious, but incredibly cute!! The fried chicken was pretty good and came in a little basket. My favorite was the dessert! They had my favorite, macaroons! And chocolate molten lava cake! Everything was DELICIOUS!. . The service was great and we were seated super close to the food! We did wait in line for a little while, but worth the wait. . . Can't wait to return! Next week maybe? :D
I love this place! I've been to Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon and both are amazing... But as for experience, i take wicked spoon! No line at all for a Sunday night. Fast and great service. And the food is such high quality and unique and just so tasty!. . At bacchanal it's a very crowded and way too many separate rooms and walkways where dining tables are in the middle can be a little chaotic! But wicked spoon has a simple and elegant layout where it's spaced out and you can relax and eat.. . The sausage at wicked spoon btw is so juicy and amazing! I also loves the goat cheese with poached pear :) I definitely want to come back!
This is a popular buffet in Vegas. Here's how it goes: Get in line to pay. Pay for your food. Get in line to be seated. Overall took about 30 minutes to be seated.. . Service - Once you're seated the service is great. The waiters who bring you drinks and clear your plates were all very friendly and quick.. . Location - In the Cosmopolitan. Lots of room inside. Didn't seem crowded at all. There was a bit of a line for the crab legs, but other than that there were no lines for any of the food.. . Food - Great. Lots of breakfast, lunch, and dinner food options. Lots of dessert options too! We came for lunch, so I'm sure there would be even more options and variety if you go for dinner.. . Drinks - Water, soda, and coffee are complimentary. Alcohol is not included. I wish mimosas were complimentary. . . Price - Expensive. Be prepared to spend some money. For lunch on the day after Thanksgiving it was $42 per person. . . I would definitely come back here again. In my opinion the food was better here than at the regular restaurants in Vegas.
We went to this buffet on Thanksgiving day.  We waited 1 1/2 hours to get in, as the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars had a 7 hour wait.  . . The food was decent.  I'm not really a buffet fan, but I thought they did a good job replacing the food even though it was crazy busy.  There is a nice variety and everything we tried was good.  I love the fact that most items came in small plates so there was less waste, especially if you didn't like something.. . I was disappointed there was no bone marrow available that day (unless I missed it).  I was looking forward to trying it in a low risk situation!  . . Do try the pork carnitas on a homemade tostada.  It is divine.
Didn't have to wait too long to get seated. On the outlook the food looks impressive but having had other buffets, I felt the food choice and taste was actually a little disappointing.
Went to the weekly dinner last week and paid for $38 per person + tax. The atmosphere, service, food presentation, and room decoration were way better than the typically $20 buffet you can find else where. But I'm hesitant to praise on the quality of the food, especially on sushi and mains. Both my friend and I agreed that the quality of the food served here is not as good as a decent restaurant, but the chef tried and overall it's a nice experience.
This buffet used to be awesome when it first opened, it had high quality stuff and tons of options. I went there recently and it tasted like a generic cheap-o buffet that Vegas is notoriously known for. Same stuff mostly, just cheaper and lower quality from what they previously provided. . . What was once great, has fallen. Pass.
Hi out there this place cuz there's one star because the food with old service bad and need not to say anymore try at your own risk
Came here for dinner buffet. No line to pay and waited about 20-30 to be seated.  . . This place is seriously overhyped.  The food selections are mostly Asian fusion-type fare and the selection is very limited.  For such a popular buffet, I was surprised about the lack of choices available especially during dinner time and I didn't particularly like anything I ate.  . . Honestly, this buffet is more like 2 stars.  I think atmosphere/decor of the place is very nice and trendy and the way most of the dishes are served in little containers is very cute so I bumped it up to 3 stars.  I don't regret trying this buffet out but I will not be returning.  The selection and quality for $40+ is not worth it to me. I will stick with Bacchanal as my go-to buffet for now!
I was lucky enough to not have to wait in a huge line for the buffet.  Saturday night at 8pm and we were let almost right in.  I loved how they displayed the food and it was yummy as well.  The desserts were amazing and our waiter kept the drinking flowing.  Great experience and would love to return.
You can't go wrong with Wicked Spoon for lunch or dinner for what they offer! Good for large groups as well. Dinner is more expensive but I would prefer lunch as they still have a lot of good dishes like prime rib, pork belly, bone marrow, sushi, seafood, etc. if you think about it, at a regular restaurant for a couple can go up to $150+ easy!! The service is good, the place is classy and not as busy as you would think. It's located deep in Cosmopolitan but they make you walk for the food you will eat. At least, they have bathrooms within the area and you don't have to go outside the restaurant...that is my pet peeve!. . This is a must try! This is my regular buffet place we head to when we visit Vegas. =}
I've tried most of the buffet places in the strip (bacchanal @caesers, Arias buffet, Bellagios buffet, Monte Carlos,.....) I still think wicked spoon is one of the best buffet wise.  Not as many varieties as bacchanal but quality wise the food is good.. . My suggestion go eat buffet for brunch. $10 cheaper than dinner price and go to a nice restaurant for dinner.  So many high end restaurants that you need to try at least one.
11/29/14: Came here for lunch.  I think it's one of the better Las Vegas buffets.. . For lunch:. . Meats: They had the usual high-end red meats--if I remember correctly, prime rib, top sirloin, and even steak-sliced bacon(!!!).  All of it was cooked perfectly medium-rare.  Juicy and tasty.  I think they also had various poultries but I didn't pay much attention to them.. . Vegetables: A variety of American stuff like yams and brussel sprouts.  They had some fancier stuff too, but I can't remember the names.. . Seafood: Yup, they had crab legs.  But I was a little disappointed with that selection--all of it was pretty thin with not much meat.  A lot of it was still frozen.  Not the best crab.  I think places like Bellagio / Wynn / etc. had much better seafood.  But it is nice they had it for lunch--many places only put that stuff out for dinner.  They had various other things like mussels but I avoided those having my share of... adventures... from eating bad ones.  And since we were gonna be going to Hakkasan at night, this was not the time to be having such adventures!. . Dessert: Not bad.  Some stand outs like a citrus pie-like thing with meringue topping, and a chocolate cone thingie.  But I think some of the other higher-end buffets like Bellagio have better desserts.. . Overall I was pleased.  I think of all the mid to high-end buffets in Vegas, this one is in the top 30% or so.  So, that deserves a 4/5.. . #buffet #ayce #vegasbuffet
Very good buffet,allot of great fancy selection of food and salad and desserts,buetiful design and decor,good service and friendly...
I'm typically not a fan of buffets but this one is great. The food is of higher quality than typical buffets with a ton of choices to please your palate. Service is friendly and attentive
I'm not a big buffet eater. I hardly ever get my money's worth when I eat at a buffet. That being said, I tried to get my money's worth at Wicked Spoon. They have a wide selection of delicious bites, including bone marrow! But one can only eat so much bone marrow before feeling like you've just been sucking the fat off a bone.. oh wait... . . I laid off most of the carbs wherever I could and set my sights on proteins prepared in different, interesting ways and then concluding with a rather large plate of desserts and gelato :) . . The food was definitely beautifully presented and quite filling. I won't be back for a year, so that should be enough time to forget how gluttonous the experience was :)
At $27 for brunch during the week, it's a little pricier than other places, such as Paris Buffet.  I came here with high expectations and left a little disappointed.  Arriving at 11AM there was no line.  The food was ready to go and looked like they had been sitting there for awhile, which I guess happens when there are not many diners.  Service was good and plates were cleared quickly and drinks refilled.  The food was so-so.  The egg mcmuffin thing (biscuit, egg, ham) was probably my favorite.  Pineapples were good, too, as they were sweet and not sour.  But overall, things did not seem too fresh or tasty. I wonder how things are here for dinner?
If the Wicked Spoon is the best buffet this town has to offer, I'm glad I won't be wasting my time on others (not that I'm in vegas much). Maybe because I'm not that into buffets in general- I highly prefer quality to quantity- but there really wasn't anything that impressed me. Here's what I tried and a review of each:. . Cheese: I'll start out that the cheese board was fine. So I ate a lot of cheese.. Kale salad: I love kale but it was DROWNED in dressing. Beets: Either out of a can or boiled beyond recognition. Bland and gross.. Wild Boar with Asiago Gnocchi: I had high hopes on this one but it tasted- honest to god- like Chef Boyardee beefaroni. . California roll: I did it, I tried sushi at a buffet and it was exactly what I expected- inedible.. Shrimp cocktail: Edible, but so is shrimp cocktail from Walmart. At least the shrimp weren't bad.. Goat Cheese Panna Cotta: Probably the only thing on the menu I'd go back for seconds on.. . Everything looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamps baking for hours. They seem to get credit for putting food in little containers, which only means they pay many  low-wage workers when perhaps they could just get better chefs and put things in a vat. My colleague said the chicken was good.. . 2 stars because nothing made me ill and the servers were polite.
Great buffet I generally do not like buffets but the wicket spoon is great. The side dishes in there little pans and pots are great. They have a Mac and cheese bar as well as a desert bar. Usually 3 types of meats in skewers and a crab leg section. Overall good and no cross contamination
I came here for brunch yesterday and it was definitely a waste of time and money. The selection was very minimal. . . I was so excited to see green papaya salad here, but boy was I disappointed. It's definitely nothing like the real thing. There was no dim sum and the Asian foods that I did try were mediocre at best. While sushi from a sushi restaurant is always better, the sushi selection here was good compared to the sushi that I have tried at other buffets. . . The best thing here was the risotto and the poached egg on a toasted English muffin. The desserts were nice as well, but they were very similar to the things featured at the Bacchanal. The one thing that did stand out was the Thai tea gelato! YUM!
I thought this place was DELICIOUS! I was very impressed with the variety of food. I think I even liked it better than the buffet in the Bellagio. My favorite spot was the "build your own Mac and cheese bar." The Asian food was really delicious. . . The service department was kind of lacking, but I don't think I've ever had outstanding service at a buffet. . . I was pretty disappointed in my mojito. For $15 I expected something fabulous. The bartender used too much simple syrup and didn't meddle the mint. . . I really loved that they had gelato. It is my absolute favorite. Sadly they didn't have my favorite flavor (spumoni) so I settled for the Oreo cookie. Yummy! I enjoyed the chocolate covered strawberries and some of the little cakes. Some desserts were just not my thing. But the glory of a buffet is trying on of everything!
Came here for brunch and eh, nothing really special. It seemed like any other buffet on the strip. They had variety of food but none of it was so good that I wanted to get a second serving. Would I recommend this place, probably not but I went during brunch, maybe dinner is something different...
So I tried this place after Bacchanal and the first thing that stood out to me was the price. This place is about $15 cheaper than the pace at Caesar's but the quality of food is definitely not any worse. The one downside, however, is that the variety is not nearly as plentiful. . . One of the memorable things that I noticed was the custom macaroni and cheese station as well as the dessert station. The macaroons was done correctly which is surprising for a buffet. . . Best thing of this joint....is wait for it...the service! I was sitting at a real far table from the food and still my glass of water was never empty. I was annoying enough to not wait for my waiter and instead of them bitching at me for saying I needed to wait he simply told my waiter for me. Small gesture but I really appreciated that.
Fat. Fat. Fatty. Fattyness. So fat. Fat. Fat. Fat. Die.. . That's how you feel when you eat here.  Much like all Las Vegas buffets, Wicked Spoon offers a huge variety of things to eat and you will eat until you feel like vomiting.  Or you can take a poop break mid-meal (like my husband) and continue on when your stomach creates more space.. . I filled up quickly on their mac-n-cheese bar, the pastas, and their pizza.  Luckily for me, I have two stomachs (like a cow.)  One for regular meals, and one for desserts.  They have a large dessert section at Wicked Spoon, complete with a gelato/sorbet bar.  So save room for dessert, if you don't have two stomachs like me.. . Some of the great things about this buffet was that it wasn't crowded...it was actually pretty empty, the price is fairly reasonable, and it is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  Such a pretty hotel to visit if you haven't been!
Delicious! Most things were really good! Be sure to get in on the bone marrow, wicked fried chicken wings, and the seafood! Also some of the best pistachio gelato I've ever tasted and I'm a huge critic. The only thing that gave this a four rather than a five was at times the prime rib was tough but at times it was sublime, just fluctuates in quality for whatver reason. Also the Asian section really lacked choices and was kind of the lowest in quality. Pork belly didn't have crisp skin, and sushi was also not as great as it could be. . . Overall recommended.
Very nice food, and seafood
Food looks really pretty but it tastes terrible. Some are dry and some are just really salty. . If you are looking for pretty food go here.  If you are looking decent taste, avoid this place.
Nothing spectacular but everything seems to be well made. The variety is lacking compared to the other Vegas buffets I've been to. The price is reasonable for lunch. I enjoyed the food but just couldn't remember one really good item.
Went there for Sunday brunch. Not super amazing but a good variety of food. Quality was pretty good. Will go back.
Came here with mountain high expectations but went flat after found out what they offered. Servers behind the counter carving station and ice cream bar are extremely rude. Giving people stinky look. Hello! We paid over price for your pay check.... Better behave!..... Foods are so salty...so the fresh fruit juice is so accommodating! Wicked Spoon is now in my not coming back list.
This buffet is expensive! I was hesitant at first to pay the 50 dollars for an all you can eat buffet at first, until I saw the food. The food is so gourmet! Unlike every other buffet, this places serves bone marrow, fresh and flavorful seafood, kale salads, macaroons, and home-made gelatos. This is definitely a must once in your life type of places.
One of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas.  It's centrally located and provides a nice atmosphere with a great variety of food.  I will say that the buffet is a bit tucked away so it's a bit of trek from the casino floor and other restaurants. It's closer to the convention rooms than anything else.. . Some of the really good stuff I've had here were the ceviche, waldorf salad (w/ truffle oil!), prime rib, gelato, mussels.  Lots of the standard buffet stuff too but all done at a higher level than other buffets in my opinion.. . The atmosphere is casual and the service is the same.  Nothing overly stuffy about this place.. . And of course the one stand out is how they present the food.  Most everything is individually sized.  Great for tasting a little of everything!
Much less than expectation...especially considering the price!!. Choice isn't even big, less than Todai. The ad is claiming 'culinary venture' but it wasn't on that level at all. Maybe I went there Monday night?!?!. Some food was not even flesh hot enough, getting dry.. Dessert was not so bad but not extraordinary at all.
Fantastic! It's a great way to try a bunch of things you would not normally try, plus there is plenty for those that aren't as food adventurous as my husband and I. Everything is pre-portioned which I love. It all comes in its on skillets or dishes. The food is worth the money, but if you are not a big eater it is hard to justify $50 a plate. I usually do not like buffets at all, but we got a 2 for 1 deal, which made it well worth it. Homemade sausage and bacon, bone marrow, quail eggs, pork belly, and gnocchi with wild bore. All delightful. Plus, if you like blue cheese there is a pile of it fresh so you can put it on all the meats above. The caramel sticky buns are super rich and yummy. Also, there is about 10 gelatos to choose from. We shared the Thai Iced Tea, which was unique and delicious. Oh, and make sure you get the pizza. I know it's a buffet and you just spent $50 for pizza, but they have two that are genius; blue cheese and bacon and capers and salmon.
This place taste horrible!!!!!  The korean BBQ is tougher than beef jerkey, the Chinese is not authentic, basically most food is mediocre at best.. . Don't let the other postings fool you like it did to me.
I've been to this buffet since they opened, quality's been dramatically decreased.  Last night was a disaster in every way. Very very little choices, poor quality and no taste. There was absolutely not a single dish we were happy with. Before you would feel there is a head chef, now the food is terrible and most of the dishes are super spicy even their sweet potato soup( their only soup, other than chinese egg drop on the other side) was so spicy that we could not even go for a second spoon, I've never ever heard of a spicy sweet potato soup!  Lastly they've brought up the price while the quality went down. $50 per person is ridiculous for this food. I was embarrassed for taking my family there. Very disappointed
Very unprofessional, rude manager lacking in customer service skills. When we asked The manager Fresca to assist she was bluntly rude and didn't even consider what we had to say, overall poor customer service
We first went to Bellagio's buffet but the line was simply really loongg...and at 6:30, I was getting hungry.  So we went next door to the Cosmopolitan.  . . It was their holiday buffet and dinner cost $47 each + tax, so a little over $100 for 2 people.  We arrived about 6:50 and counting the wait to pay and the wait to sit was another 40 minutes.  We were seated at 7:30 PM.  . . Having eaten at the Monte Carlo buffet the night before where it was less than memorable and food looking a bit worrisome, I haveto say I enjoyed the food here!. . The place was clean, the food was presented well.  The ambiance is more relaxed than Bacchanal or Bellagios. I tried the shrimp ball, the bone marrow and the roast pork- I picked up only the crispy skin. Yum.  I did not eat any pasta, that'll fill up the stomach fast.  I tried the risotto and a tablespoon of the sweet potato casserole.  Then I went to the veggies portion, I tried the broccoli with white beans and endive salad.  Next to the seafood-- yes I attacked the crab legs, a plateful of it.  My brother the meat-eater had his fill of the ribs and beef.  . . Finally dessert, I picked the chocolate covered strawberries, the mousse and the gelato.  Topped it off with coffee.  We stayed until closing time and left at 9:30 PM.  . . The service once seated was also attentive and pleasant. I think the two seating managers were overwhelmed initially because the line kept getting longer yet only two people had the task of seating them.  A third person came close to 7:20 PM and she went out to the line and wrote down how many seats each customer lined up needed.  . . I recommend this place and would dine again if I find myself in Las Vegas.  This is a good find.
This place is NOT worth $40 the crabs had very little meat and it was dry. The other foods were also very mediocre. For $40 I expected the taste to be much better. There are even better buffets that cost $30. I regret wasting my money here!
Went Xmas day for Brunch. Was a two hour wait. Sad that they did not bring anyone on line water, or chanpagne, or juice or anything like that.  Price today went from . $29 to $45.00 for basicly the same food.Once inside, the service and food was excellent.
Been here for breakfast and lunch; different times and both occasions were good. They have a wide variety of selections and desserts are pretty awesome too. I like that it's very spacious and the food counter is neatly organized.
WARNING: If you are a die hard wicked spoon fan please don't be hurt. This is just my opinion.. . The place looked nice. There was allot of talk about this place. Unfortunately that's all it was, talk. The staff was great and very welcoming. The food was good but nothing really stood out to me to give it a 5. The wait was horrible. The line was way to long. The price didn't equal to the over all experience. Over all this place was just ok. But if you have the patients to wait in line then you probably won't mind this place. . . Conclusion: . . Staff: 5. Bathroom and restaurant cleanliness: 5. Price: 2. Food: 3.5. Wait time: 1. . Total over all experience Average = 3.3 unfortunately I can only give a 3 or 4 rating so I went with 3.
Best buffet experience in Las Vegas. The food is international and taste good. If you don't like to see big food portions but still want all you can eat, this is a must. Don't forget the bottomless champaign for 2 hours, worth the extra fee.
This used to be my favorite buffet in Vegas. It was the kind of place where you ate 95% of what you put on your plate! Now, nothing was amazing and you only wanted to eat 30-40% of what was on your plate. If you want a buffet, go to the buffet at The M. Or spend your $50 at a real restaurant on the strip for something more palatable.
The buffet at Wicket Spoon was by far the best of the buffets in Las Vegas. They had BONE MARROW! Something I have been craving ever since we were there. Their desserts were amazing as well. They also had Croque Madames which is one of my favorite sandwiches. And they had fried rice in little rice containers! I was seriously in food heaven!
This was one of the best buffets that I have been to.  The food was good, everything was hot and fresh, and I love the small plates.  Only thing wrong though is that it is nearly impossible to grab more than a couple of the small plates at a time because there is no way to possibly have them all balanced on a plate.
The highlights of my meal were the selection of meats at the carving stations (Prime Rib, Roasted Pig, Lamb, Sausage) Crispy Pork Belly, Bone Marrow, Dungeness Crab, ShrimpCocktail, Shrimp & Grits, Gelato Bar & Asst. Of Desserts. Everything else outside of that would be a waste of money and stomach space i.e., Salmon was dry, Chinese, sushi, Italian looked at tasted Eh.
My review is a bit old and from the summer. Hands down this was the best casino buffet I ever had. So much food and my friends and I stayed there for three hours eating and drinking and our server didnt seem to mind at all. Really... I have no complaints between all the food and unlimited mimosa where do I have room to complain?. . The waiter was so patient with us.  We drank and got tipsy and stayed at the buffet until it was time to eat again.  Really just can't complain.
Wicked Spoon is so awesome. The options are amazing and I don't think I tried a single dish that I didn't like. And trust me, if I could've tried all 500+ items that they offer, I would have. Unfortunately, my tummy just cannot handle that. *cue sad violin music* . Some of my favorites were the bone marrow, crab, prime rib, polenta, bbq shrimp & grits, and thai tea and pistachio gelato. Prepare yourselves for a foodgasm, people.. . I would happily pay $45/person for dinner on a Friday night again for the excellent variety and quality of food this buffet offers.
Very helpful about gluten free needs. At the beginning of the buffet, a chef walked me through all the items and what was gluten free. He also made me a special gluten free stir fry from the Asian station that was very yummy! . . In general there is a good selection of food. High end items include prime rib and crab legs, if they had stuff like oysters would be perfect. . . The sushi was not very good. Otherwise good spread.
I have mixed feelings about this place. . . Came here for breakfast and was impressed with the selection. Wicked Spoon has lots to choose from, breakfast items and non-breakfast alike. Some of the items were really good. But some were just bad. Really bad. The French toast? Delicious. Mac and cheese? Loved it. The mashed potatoes? Ew. How in the world do you mess up mashed potatoes? Oh, I know. Throw in some horseradish, and call it fancy. Gross. Overall, you'll find some good stuff here. You'll also find some bad stuff. It's a buffet, so not everything is going to please you. But in the end it has something for everybody. . . Now for the miscellaneous stuff. Breakfast was reasonably priced at $39/person. Restaurant was clean, and food was replaced as needed. Server was absent most of the time, but that's fine. I don't like being bothered when I eat. Except when I need a drink refilled. And I definitely could have used another iced tea to wash down those mashed potatoes.
Every year for the past five years my three sisters and I take a trip to Vegas. One. Of the things we look forward to the most is having the dinner buffet at the wicked spoon. I am not a seafood eater but The whole trip there they talk about how they are going to eat crab crab and more crab.. . We got in more than an hour before what they said was closing time and set off to eat and one of my sisters came back with a plate of sorry spindly crab legs. She said they closed the crab legs station which meant that the other three would not be getting any !!! . . Several other stations were closing down and what was left of the more popular ones were shutting down before we could even get to them . . When I spoke to the manager she said that there was no set menu so nothing was guaranteed. What kind of answer is that to dissatisfaction!? The waiter said had we let him know he would have talked to the cook about it and made  him make some more but once we talked to the manager (who he said was new) it was too late. . . There are too many other buffets to try than to go back to wicked spoon and be as disappointed as we were again. For the price you should be able to get a staple buffet food like crab legs.. . So long wicked spoon. Hello Bacchanal (?) yelp era spend your $$ somewhere else !!
Came here for Brunch on Christmas after the Belliago had a 3 hour wait, I will have to say this buffet is as good or better than the Belliago.. .  We were staying in the Cosmopolitan and since I am a Marriott Platinum member we were able to bypass the hour line and get seated immediately with our party of 8. . . Options were endless with Crab Legs, Mussels, Oysters, and many cuisines to choose from. One of my favorites was the Chocolate & Heath Bar covered strawberries and Gelato on the the dessert bar.. . Definitely a must if you are in Vegas and especially if you are staying at the Cosmopolitan!
Pretty good. Large selection. Went for breakfast since there was a 2 hour wait for dinner. Glad it was comped by casino.
This used to be our FAVORITE brunch buffet in Vegas and unfortunately over the last couple of years it has gone down hill :(  . . They used to have a huge selection of food for breakfast and lunch and now it's very small and just shoved in a corner. and the service is really bad:(  . . The over all quality is lacking, it's a shame
We had brunch here. $39/person.. . I think it is a bit overpriced.. . Not much variety in food. . . Desserts are good. But to be honest, even if you have 100 choices I'm not going to eat more than 10 at one meal.. . Limited seafood selections. The sushis were meh... . Not very impressive for the price.
One of my favorite places to eat in vegas. It's a lil pricy but the buffet style eating rivals any other they had Red velvet pancakes they had a strawberry pineapple and OJ blended drink that was new and really tasty. they had the usual types of food you find at a brunch.
Really enjoyed dinner here. Unlike the Aria where we paid full adult price for our 3rd and 4th grade kids last year, and all they ate were two slices of cheese pizza, they had kids pricing here so it was easier on the wallet. Our son enjoyed the Mac and cheese bar. Chef was friendly and made it to order. I enjoyed everything I tried: prime rib, Kung pao chicken, fried chicken, pizza, etc. Wife had seafood. Didn't bother with the sushi as the selection was limited to three or four items, two of them with unagi another ebi, not my favorites. Tasty sugar-free chocolate gelato and decaf ended the meal for me.
Food has improved since the last time we werr here a couple of years ago. Pork belly is really (kinda on the salty side though), goes well with the wedge salad!. Excellent service.
Not what i have expected. . Not enough seafood with this price range ($47) . Deserts not good at all, too sweet!!! . Entrees are too salty !!! . No toasters for bread. . People working back in the kitchen didn't clean the seafood properly. My friend bite on the rock in the clams and hurt his teeth . Its too ridiculous!!!
I will dream about this place until my next trip to Vegas.  Foodie heaven......!
Is this the best buffet in terms of presentation, quality of food? Yes! Is this the best buffet I've had? No!. . Its brightest spot is pastry, which is not my thing, I would give it a 5 star; its meat section I would say is 3 star for me considering its price, it does have lamb but I would expect lamb chop, again for its price, it has roast beef and ribs but I expect steak (maybe it does but certainly not the grilled types I love); seafood selection, crab legs pretty good and I like that they cut it open so lazy people like me just take it out to eat, but that is about it, mussels too cheap for my taste, shrimp not so impressive.. . Basically lacking the wow factor other than the pastry. I paid $50, maybe Xmas is just the wrong time to have buffet in Vegas?
Honestly I don't understand why it has that many good reviews. I just feel it was normal. $50 is kinda not worthy. It didn't have a large variety.
Wicked Spoon is overpriced at $40 pp. There was a massive food selection to pick from, ranging from sushi to gelato to pasta. The beef borguinione was good, as well as the pasta. The Asian food wasn't very good; the sushi was not very fresh tasting and pretty bland, the noodles very dry, and the pork was salty. The dessert section was big, but lacking in quality. 80% of the macarons were cracked, and the gelato wasn't too great either. . The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice but a little crowded. Towards 7 or 8 PM the line gets pretty long, so come early. You can also get a discount and skip the general line if you are a Marriott Platinum or Gold member (something like that) but getting the card to skip the line was a hassle. Overall, decent buffet and nice atmosphere. About on par with Bacchanal at Caesar's.
