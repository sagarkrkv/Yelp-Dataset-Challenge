Jean Philippe ... please start investing little on your to go boxes. I got sweet trio to go and found all caramel out side of Creme Brule because the box in which it was packed was too small. I have seen small cupcakes shops doing better job in packing pastries
Awesome!
Had my first pastry of the trip today and the almond brioche didn't disappoint.  Likewise with my mocha.   Lunch will be a wonderful pannini sandwich.
Pretty expensive but it's pretty good deserts. Looks pretty as well and tastes good. $6.25 for coffee? Well this is Vegas after all.
I think the bakery here is just a hype. This place is located in Aria and a plus side is it opens from 6am-2am, super fit for the vegas scene. Like all vegas places, this place has a long line. Really hate when you have to wait for 20 min to get a pastry... . . Taste wise, I tried the brioche, the muffin. I should say they taste good, but there are many pastries in LA that taste same good, or better, but no need for such a long a line and pay such a high price. It's so vegas. I feel like if I were not staying in Aria, I would not come just to get a bite. But it is convenient if you live in the hotel.
The employees here have French accents!!!! I know, right??? But seriously, this place was great! I was waiting for my boyfriend to cash out and was craving something sweet. Look to the left and there was Dessert galore!! Such a hard choice to make with the many options... But went safe with the cheesecake. Oh wowsers!!!! Definitely going to try more than the cheesecake next visit.
This is a very cute and convenient little shop in the beautiful aria hotel lobby. The chicken pesto panini and chocolate gelato were good, but not great. My sister had the coconut gelato and really enjoyed it. Both the almond and chocolate croissants were delicious-highly recommend those! I would go back, but only for the croissants. Prices were on par with the usual elevated prices of vegas.
OK so here's an update.. . Because the almighty yelper Nelson Q is not allowed to post his own review for his employer (understandable due to the conflict of interest but... what a shame considering how passionate he is about his work!), I'm going to pass what I heard from him here.. . The Nutella Napoleon and Opera Slice are his personal faves in the dessert case, and on the retail side, the World Champion cookies (Hazelnut and Gianduja cookies), and the Exotic Crepe for tropical flavors. in the gelato section, Pistachio and Hazelnut.. . Also, the best time to go there is between 9-10am as they fill the dessert case around that time.. . Next week, JPP will get two kinds of Christmas Logs (Buche De Noel) - they just finished assembling one which has orange confit, almond nougatine, exotic cremeux, and vanilla mousse inside. There is also a chocolate variation assembled over the new few days.. . Sounds amazing, no??
Some of the Best Desserts on earth.  The selection is 2nd to none.  The Chocolates melt in your mouth.  Coffees are typical. The torts and sticky buns are just ok.  If your looking for a chocolate fix. This is the place.  The gelato is fresh and the variety is good.
Long lines, a so so coffee, ok sandwiches and a very very high bill. The place looks like million $$$ (actually it looks way more than that) but the food is not as good as it looks. I miss Stumptown coffee
This review is for the gelato. One scoop $3.75, two scoops $5.75, additional scoops $2 each. However each scoop was about the equivalent of two scoops, so at least we experienced a generously portioned two scoop order that we could barely finish. Not only that but the per scoop price was 50 cents less than what we'd seen at the Bellagio.. . We tried the hazelnut and the pistachio. I would recommend the hazelnut and the chocolate! None were the best gelato we'd ever had, but it hit the spot after hoofing it for a few hours. Seating can be a bit tight given they have so many things to offer there but once seated it was comfortable. . . Very recommended! We'll be back.
Some of the best desserts Iv'e had outside of Paris. The passion fruit tart and key lime were the best and had such a unique flavor. The dessert are quite pricey so if you're coming to have breakfast for 2 you're looking to spend around $50.. . The crepes are also very good and you can get sweet or savory ones (nutella and salmon were good), the salmon sandwich wasn't anything special but the turkey and cranberry croissant sandwich was good. The lines here are always long and it's always packed so you won't always be able to find a seat. You can skip the sandwiches and stick to the dessert crepes and pastries.
had a pricey cheesecake it was rich and sweet the oreo crust was good. ordered a white chocolate mocha as well, used too much syrup way too sweet... . service was slow, they had my order ready sitting on a tray on their counter and i couldn't get it because not one employee has enough initiative to hand it to me so i stood there for a few minutes food paid for just waiting for nothing....
Honestly this place is  3 at most. Sure the food is a 5 but the service is truly lacking. The employees don't seem to be engaged with the customer. They're just in their own worlds, ignoring the customer. We had to remind them just to give us water and we had to tell them to change the cake because they gave us the wrong order. But otherwise the cakes were good.
This little cafe area was located right next to the Aria Guest Elevators and it was dangerously tempting EVERY SINGLE TIME.  I went there three times during my four day stay haha.  It definitely gets crowded here with the long lines and small seating area.  Definitely have someone in your party go wait for a table and have them order for you.  They have a huge variety of coffee, pastries, desserts, crepes, gelato, omelettes, salads, and sandwiches.  It could get complicated as there are three lines.  The right side is the coffee and pastry line.  The left side has two lines (but they sell the same things) and they sell coffee, crepes, and omelettes. . . . CARAMEL TWIST: I LOVED this coffee drink so much.  It was still strong, but not overwhelmingly sweet.  I ordered this every single time. WINNER IN MY BOOKS.. . BERRY CREPE: Not overly sweet and it's yummy.  Made to order fresh!  This crepe comes with marinated berries on top and a scoop of whipped cream on the side.  Perfect to satisfy a little sweet tooth.  . . MUSHROOM OMELETTE: HUGE omelette with mushrooms scattered around.  It does cost like ten dollars, but at least  they make it seem like they used five eggs to make it haha.  Healthy and hearty choice.. . GELATO: I only tried the creme brulee and mango gelato.  Both were good, but I definitely could only handle so much of each.  The texture was on point, but the flavors were both on the strong side.  Creme Brulee was sweet and mango tasted a little too artificial for me.  . . ALMOND CROISSANT: It was big and yummy.  Inside the croissant, there's a sweet paste.  I definitely needed help finishing it because I can only handle so much sweetness, but it was definitely good. . . . This place can get a little pricy, but what isn't in Vegas?  I also noticed they had another location in Bellagio too!
