Not the most exciting dinner experience I've ever had, but I guess most people are here to gamble, not eat. We were seated by a hostess with absolutely no personality...not a smile, even. And slow as a tortoise, to boot. But upon getting seated, we definitely got stuck with the dud waiter. It took him forever to come back and take our orders, and then another 10 minutes to flag him down to get cutlery. But on to the food.... . I shared a vegetable salad and the route 80 burger (bacon, cheese, caramelized onions), with a side of buffalo fries (curly fries smothered in buffalo sauce and blue cheese). The salad was delightful - crispy veggies, a few exotic ones that I looked and went "What are you?", and a tasty but light oregano dressing. The burger, which we ordered medium as suggested, was only ok. I guess I expected more than run of the mill, but it wasn't terribly exciting. It wasn't bad, necessarily, just not great. But the buffalo fries is where they fell down - while I loved the concept, the combo of buffalo sauce and blue cheese was incredibly salty, and not even the side of ranch dressing could make it edible after a few bites. It was too bad, because the spicy flame on the fries was great before the salt hit.
Overall average food at inflated prices (but that's Vegas for ya). Great for larger parties and for watching whatever game(s) are on. They literally have three TV screens stacked on top of each other, each playing a different sports channel. . . To be honest, I had to think really hard back on what I ordered.. nothing really spectacular. The lamb burger is pretty good. The lamb is not too gamey, and the mint-cilantro sauce isn't too heavy.  . . +1 star for the superb service. Funny story, the waiter heard my bf & I 'debate' on whether to get curly fries or sweet potato fries. We opted for sweet potato, but when our order came out, it was half sweet potato and half curly fries! We didn't even think about getting a half-half order, and the waiter said, "I figured I could meet you guys halfway". So attentive :)
I came here after I left the wax museum. I had the lamb burger, cooked medium with a beer and fries (for an additional $10), but it was well worth it. the burger is huge and I only ate half plus the fries and drank the beer. Our waitress was great, very friendly and attentive. Thank you!!!!!!
I can take a party of 10 here and get great service.  Server got all our orders correctly and was attentive throughout.  He also made great suggestions and was detailed when describing the menu.   The manager Michael was very nice when checking on our table.  I made a comment about not liking sesame seeds.  He insisted to send my burger back for a wheat bun instead.  I will always show my friends the restaurants that I know will take good care of them. . . I love truffle. The American Wagyu is great with the truffle aioli and Brie cheese. . I like the fried pickles also.
I'm not really sure why all the marginal reviews of BLT. I went in at a fairly busy time and was seated fairly quickly. The server came by and took our order quickly and the food and drinks came out quickly as well. I had the 80 Burger, which has bacon, BBQ sauce, grilled onions and cheddar. It was exceptional, possibly one of the best burgers I've had in Vegas, and I've tried a lot. My friend had the Texas Burger with no bun and he seemed very happy with it. The waffle fries were good, but not great. The onion rings were excellent! Because there are so many great restaurants in Vegas, I rarely go back to the same restaurant twice, but I will definitely go back to BLT.
I was excited to try this place based on the reviews, but the burger had no flavor (I watched them cook them and they don't season the patties. Also, the patties look frozen, and are definitely pre-made and come out of a tub.) . . I'd honestly pick McDonald's over this place based on the flavor alone, not to mention a burger + fries is $20+ here. Do yourself a favor and go to Gordon's Burgr: you'll get a better burger for the price.
If you're going to get a burger in Vegas, BLT Burger will leave you disappointed.  You are much better off going to Holsteins in the Cosmo, where the burgers are phenomenal. I recommend BLT Steak wholeheartedly, but next time I'll pass on BLT Burger.
Although the waitstaff was good, the food was underwhelming. I had the classic burger with onion rings. The onion rings were greasy and the burger was nothing special.
Very good burgers. Had the BLT with blue cheese and it was perfect. Simple but expertly prepared. Will come back again.
Went to this place with my family for lunch and this place wasn't as good as I remembered when I went here the first time. The Hispanic hostess with her hair tied back in a ponytail was pretty rude when I requested to move to another table because it was cold where we were sitting. She could tone down the attitude, it's not like I was asking for something so difficult. The waiter was okay, but not very talkative and just took our order without seeming very hospitable. . . I ordered the route 80 burger and it was basically just a step better than a bbq burger you can get for much cheaper at Carl's junior. $16 for a burger with burnt, super salty bacon with a dry party is definitely not worth it. I ordered my burger medium well and it was not cooked that way. I would have requested a new burger, but judging by the attitude of some workers, I'd rather not risk then doing something weird to my food. The skinny fries are basically just regular fries that have been reheated. Do yourself a favor and save your $5 or order the onion rings instead. On the bright side, if you manage to finish the whole burger, you should be full for a while. . . I would not recommend coming here if you have a burger craving. Check out Guy Fieri's burger bar or go to Holstein's for amazing burgers and shakes. Save your money for those places!
