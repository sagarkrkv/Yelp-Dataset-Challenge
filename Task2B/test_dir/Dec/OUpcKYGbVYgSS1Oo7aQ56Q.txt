Meh. Just okay. Outdated rooms. $15 WiFi. Really??? Called for a bellhop and waited at least 15 minutes. And although it's not the hotel's fault, there was loud construction outside at 3 in the morning. Not very conducive to sleeping. We only stayed here because we got a good deal, but I wouldn't stay here again.
We came here to play black jack and had one great dealer who kept us entertained each time he was at our table. Very nice place and good music ! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it was a pain trying to order drinks while gambling. The cocktail girls weren't on top of it! Slow!
NIGHTMARE ON FREMONT ST. . My driver dropped me off at the hotel in the back and when I say driver I received a ride alone in a short bus from the airport. I was staying in the Carson tower and when I walked in I was informed to go to the Carson tower registration. . . So I started walking through the craziness of a Vegas Casino. Maneuvering around tired people who are drinking a lot and losing too much money. They are like rats trapped in a box for 4 days and 3 nights and are in no hurry to go anywhere. But I pushed on and made my way past the mayhem while dragging my suitcase to get to the Carson tower for check in.. . When I arrived at the Carson registration desk there was a sign that said Desk closed. Check in at the Rush Tower. What? So now I had to go back through the mayhem again. I pushed through and when I got to the Rush Tower there was a sign that informed me to check in at the Gold Tower registration because the desk was closed. What?. . At this point I felt like there were hidden cameras laughing at my every move. I took a deep breath and decided to look for the Gold Tower registration. I asked the lady running the high roller Keno room and she pointed me to the VIP check in door. I knew this wasn't correct but I was frustrated and I was going to make it work. . . So I walked in with my frustrated face and informed the staff of my wild goose chase I had just been on. I also dropped the Keno ladies name because it's always good to drop a name. I believe they took a little pity on me but the staff was very unapologetic to my dilemma. They were also very unfriendly and it was probably because I wasn't a high roller VIP. I did ask them if it's normal to send guests on a scavenger hunt to check in and they looked at me like it wasn't a big deal. I then asked if they were going to fix the incorrect signs and they told me no. After 10 hours of no sleep and traveling I had no more fight in me but I do know this was wrong. . . Upon walking to my room I finally walked past the open registration desk for the Gold Tower. I will say this was a frustrating way to arrive at a hotel. . . So I get into my room and start unpacking my bag. I then go to the bathroom to wash my face and realized someone had used the bathroom. Yes someone sat on the toilet seat, used the toilet paper, unwrapped the soap and used a clean towel. I'm too exhausted for this. I called down and spoke with the front desk. I also asked if I could be moved to a new room. Of course my request was denied and a maid was sent up to clean my room. A housekeeping manager walked in and told the maid to clean my whole room including the sheets. She was actually nice and hard working. So I left my room for an hour to let the maid do her job. . . Day 2...I wake up early and leave to get my work day started. When I arrived back 4 hours later my room wasn't clean. I spoke with the maid in the hall and she said they would clean my room by 1pm. She even wrote me on her list. I came back to the room at 2pm and it wasn't clean. I called Housekeeping and they said they would send someone up. I got back to my room at 5pm and it was still dirty. I called and spoke with a manager who promised to take care of it and my room was finally cleaned at 6pm. Honestly is it that hard?. . Day 3...It was my only day to sleep in and the maid bangs 5 times with the vacuum cleaner even though I had a "Do Not Disturb" sign on my door! Was it necessary to ram my door that many times? It was just rude. She knew what she was doing. . . Day 4...The room was prepaid by my client but for some reason the hotel decided to charge my credit card. I called down to the front desk and they were no help. The girl on the phone was rude and unhelpful. Then when I went downstairs that same girl was there. She was mean to me because of our phone call. I asked her to only see a copy of my bill. She printed me a bill with my credit card charged. She then slid open a drawer where she had her personal cell phone and started texting. This was incredibly rude & why would you do this in front of an upset customer. I did snap a photo of her displaying this unacceptable behavior. I really believe the staff needs to go through a hospitality travel course because they don't get it. . . The hotel staff doesn't have any good customer service. The employees seem unhappy and it translates into the bad customer service I received. In all of my travels, I've never seen a more incompetent  staff, then here. . . On another note: the room was nice. I was expecting dirty old gross Vegas but that is not what I received. The casino was very modern. The pool had a shark tank in the middle which was really cool. You could even water slide through the middle of the sharks. This place wasn't what I expected. It's just sad that the customer service isn't there. I score hard on being treated nice and the Golden Nugget failed on every level.
We stayed here for 6day & never had a bad experience, the staff was great, food was soo good & the rooms are very comfy...
A great place to stumble in to when you are on the Fremont experience. It is a crazy hotel that is a tight fit and often seems packed, even on a slow day. Their drinks are not over priced like other places but their service is below par. It takes a while to get a hold of a bartender to service you, and sometimes they talk with others and delay your order. Its a cool experience to visit this very famous hotel, but it does not seem like a place too stay as the upkeep is average.
Always have a great time when I come here to stay. Perfect "diet" version of the strip. Kimberly (from Vegas ) at the front desk was super helpful in giving us directions and sending us to non tourist spots. For sure coming back.
The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because of $10 per computer, per night wifi, the not so great spa, and the blah buffet.  The lack of resort fee makes up for the cost of wifi, but they really do need to upgrade their spa and buffet.  The room itself was wonderful and extremely reasonably priced.   I love the new trend of no bed spread, so everything on the bed is freshly washed.  The sheets were soft, and the bed very comfy.  The room was clean and spacious.  Love the pool.  The slide is super fun.   However, the jacuzzi is not hot enough and the jets were weak.  The massages at the spa were good, but the facilities need to be revamped.  Otherwise, what fun Freemont Street is these days!. . Played a bit of slots and came out about even.  I'm pleased with that.
Typical Landry's overpriced, under serviced and snooty.. . They are trying to be a high end strip property which they are not! They are in the working class Freemont Strip area, and shouldn't be as snooty as what they are. The entire staff act's like they work at the Wynn or a nice facility on the strip. Some of the food is nice, but pricey, and there is better for the same price point around.
The new decor is really great (coming from a guy who's wife thinks he has no sense of design). She loves it too (I think I said something right). If you have been in the Gold Tower before, you will love the change! One slight design problem though.. WHO DECIDED THAT TOILET PAPER FIXTURES SHOULD BE PLACE VERTICALLY, ABOVE THE WASTEBASKET... AND SO CLOSE TO THE TOILET THAT ONLY A CONTORTIONIST COULD REACH THE PAPER? OOPS! Hey maintenance, if you have a chance, make those puppies horizontal and a little away from the toilet, so that they are manageable.. Thanks,. A huge Golden Nugget fan for 25 years!
best pool you are going to find is vegas is definetly here! surrounded by a huge shark tank! included with water slide that goes through it. Also an adult pool (which you have to pay for entrance) is also a great escape from the tons of children. The hotel room was okay had some issues with the shower drain, besides that they reponded to issue very quickly. We choose this hotel specifically for the pool and were both very happy with our choice!
I am very disappointed with my stay thus far. I've stayed here before,  but it appears their standards have dropped.  We rented 2 rooms for our stay, since it was our anniversary and Chritmas, we traveled as a family of 5. Our rooms had nothing but issues. Room 12108 had gum stains on the floor (which they came and cleaned after a call to housecleaning), and hair in the bed (they came and changed the sheets after 2 calls to housecleaning). In Room 12110 the shower was filthy, there were blood stains on one of the towels, and when we woke up in the morning we realized that there were dried blood stains on the comforter. This is not acceptable for a Hotel that claims to be a 4 Star property.  This is very disappointing, considering that we are paying customers.  I understand we booked the lowest rate, which must place us in the oldest tower, however this is not acceptable. I will be speaking to Hotel Management today.
Just when I thought finally  arrived to be told the two beds room I paid for was gone and I should of read the fine print, so I asked for a manager, ten min later she comes with a bad attitude and presided to tell me you should of been here sooner so I got loud at the point a room became available she offered me nothing even when I told here I walked a long ways in the cold wind to find a parking and it took me over an hour all I wanted is a little simpathy  thx for nothing Roxane. You should be hidden in the back not running  the front disk.
i can't wait until my next vegas trip because i'm for sure going to stay here again!! my bf and i are big fremont st. fans. the strip is great, but it's a lot more casual, less crowded, and just more fun overall in downtown. we live in SoCal but every time we come to vegas, we always go to the bars/casinos here. . . I know the hotels here are a lot older than average, but i was pleasantly surprised by how modern and chic looking it is inside. right when i saw the aquarium behind the check in counter i was like, whoa okay i like this place. it was a fast and easy process and up our room we went. Booked a standard carson tower room but it's pretty spacious! the room looked renovated and clean, no complaints here! topped off the night with dinner at the grotto and was off to get wasted in dtlv.
Never again! Terrible hotel. I wonder how they have got 4 stars. We came there to find dirty bath tub with the water that does not drain. Called maintenance but no one came so we asked the front desk to get another room. The manager at the front desk said "it happens". What happens? They don't clean the room before new guests arrive? Also, they do not have a fitness center, nor enough room in the garage for their guests. They told me to park somewhere else and they will validate the ticket. Additionally, they charged me for services I did not use so I had to call them and insist to remove that charge. I would give them zero stars.
this is our second time to stay at the downtown Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino, staff and the amenities are always great, room prices are very competitive. we will be back
