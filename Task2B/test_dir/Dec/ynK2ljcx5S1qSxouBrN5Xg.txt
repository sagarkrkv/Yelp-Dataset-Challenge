Got a cheap deal and decided to stay here... now I realize why it was cheap.. . This review is purely on the hotel room we got.. When we checked in, it took a very long time, even though there was 5 different people working and only 2 of which were actually checking in customers. No worries, I am a patient lady and I am also in no rush. We checked in and the receptionist gave us our key and we were on our way.. . We got a room with a lovely view of... the hotel's air conditioner unit. No big, I didn't pay much for the room.. I started to unpack because the drive had been so long and I just wanted to sit on the bed. I got my things settled and then took my shoes and socks off and then walked over to my bed when I stepped on.... something. No clue what it was. It was very brown and very sticky. Okay- note to self, don't walk by the left side of the bed without shoes on.. My friend and I started to change and get dressed for a night out. I walked over to grab my bag when, a large, metal, panel for the electrical unit in the room fell on me. Literally fell and hit me in the back. I thought I had done it but when I tried to put it back, I realized, there weren't any screws in it except for one... which had ALSO come loose. I decided to call front desk to make sure we don't get charged for this and to be honest, I was kind of expecting an apology. Nothing. I told the lady who picked up what had happened and she laughed and said, "Don't worry about it. Thanks". . Luckily, I only spent one night there otherwise, I would have been a bit peeved that I had spent ANY money on this place.
For the price I paid, 250 dollars for a four night stay (including Friday and Saturday night), staying at the Stratosphere was worth it. I consider it a mid-range hotel: better than a motel or off-strip hotel, but nowhere near as good as the other more well known hotels on the strip. . . The first thing I will mention is that the front desk agent Maria was very helpful, and even upgraded my room to a suite for free. I booked the room through Verizon Rewards, and apparently you just get whatever is available. I was going to get a room with two beds, which was excessive since I was alone, but Maria fixed it and gave me the free upgrade. She was also very friendly, and I can tell she will go far in her hospitality career. Someone give her a raise or a promotion, because she deserves it. . . The suite included a bedroom, living room area and a bathroom. The room was spotless and it came with two large flatscreen televisions, a refrigerator and free cable. Definitely not bad at all for the price I paid, and they put me up on the 21st floor (the view wasn't great, but it was still neat being up that high). The air conditioning worked perfectly, and the shower was always hot. The water pressure wasn't the greatest, but it did the job. . . The location wasn't the greatest, and I found myself using cabs a lot since it takes forever to walk anywhere from here. I'm used to New York City blocks, which are much shorter and crammed with businesses. When I heard something was two blocks away, I got excited that it was close...only to walk and have it take almost twenty minutes to get there. Vegas definitely isn't a walking town unless you are in the heart of the Strip. The oppressive heat didn't help things either, but that's not the hotel's fault at all. . . I honestly didn't spend very much time on the gaming floor since I'm not a big gambler, but it did seem to be a tad bit outdated. There wasn't really anything impressive about it or anything that stuck out in my mind. It just looked like a generic casino. . . I would stay here again if I got another great deal, but I think next time I'll try booking at a hotel that is more conveniently located down the strip closer to entertainment.
This is THE place to go for happy hour!  All appetizers are 1/2 price and drinks are 2 for 1.  The view is AMAZING!!  BEST in Vegas!!  Watch the thrill seekers bungee past the windows 110 stories up in the air.  Great shrimp/lobster cocktail and sliders.. Comfortable, clean, good service, INCREDIBLE!  Lots of parking in large garage that connects at 2nd floor (but park 3, 4, or 5 and take the elevator down to 2 and avoid the mass crowd.  Many people think you have to buy a ticket just to go up to the bar or restaurant or viewing platform--THIS IS FREE!  Don't be confused with those buying tickets for the rides.  AWESOME experience in an older, out of the way hotel.  Well worth the trip--you won't be disappointed.
Last night I went to the Stratosphere for the night.  I tried to check in prior to the official check in of 3 pm and I was warned that there would be a 10 dollar surcharge applied to the room because I went in before the 3 pm posted check in time.  Unfortunately, the room was not ready at 130 or 230 when I approached the registration.  So I saved the ten dollars.  About 515 I went back for the third time and I was able to successfully check in.  The room was OK but the hot water in the shower was not real hot and it took about 10 minutes for the shower water to turn from cold to warm.  That was disappointing considering this hotel is not that old.  The Top of the World restaurant was good but pricey for what you received.  The view was nice and that is really what you are paying for. The man at security took my selfie stick that attaches to my camera for some reason.  He said I could not take it up front.  It is plastic and could never be considered a weapon by any one with some sense.  This one still puzzels me.  The valet was quick and easy.  The C bar was expensive and I paid 9 dollars for two Miller Lite beers.  I will not return to the hotel part of this place but would go back to the Top of the World Restaurant.
I would never in life stay here... The rooms are not bad what was so nasty and scared me are the bed bugs here. Ewhhh I had bites I assumed it was from a mosquito or something. Well no I got more by 2 night and my husband as well. While laying down we see one running through our sheets. As soon as I get home I washed my clothes with hot water. Be warned this place has bugs!!
After staying at the D hotel last Nov 2013 - which has its own Yelp review - it was great to be back at the Stratosphere this Sept.. . It was on this trip to Vegas that I made a crucial discovery. I have been cheating myself by not making the most of this city when I'm not staying at this resort.. . When I stayed at the D hotel on Fremont Street, I never left the downtown area. The Strip is enormously long with its grandiose resorts. When I stayed at a resort on the Strip, that hotel dictated what I'd see and do because we didn't want to venture out too far from our room. The years I reserved a room at the Palm, Mandalay Bay and Hard Rock, I felt isolated from the city. In short, I compartmentalized my visits; but, it kept me coming back year after year in different seasons for various reasons.. . This year was the second time my boyfriend and I spent 4 nights/5days at the Stratosphere for Mr Olympia in Sept. This year, our room was upgraded to a higher floor which offered a better view and bathtub. . . Because the hotel is smack in the middle of the Strip and Downtown, we always say 5 days isn't enough. We go to pool parties, clubs on and off the Strip... attend the Olympia expo and pre-judging... loiter, do the zipline and celebrate Halloween (it looks like it every night of the week) on Fremont Street... we don't think about it, it just so happens we spend time at both ends of the city; but, it only happens when we stay here, no where else. For that reason, there isn't a better reason not to!
THIS SUCKS!!!!!!!!!. . We are in Vegas for our 19th anniversary, decided for a quick get away. So we chose the Stratosphere, Grand Suite.. . The room was terrible. the staff except the bell staff were terrible. When we arrived we had to pay $10 to check in early, $5 per night to look at the ghettos of Las Vegas. . . When we got to the room there was trash on the floor outside our door, we told the cleaning lady she picked up the big pieces but left the rest.. . That being said the worst was yet to come. We went to bed and all you could here was the elevator going up and down, and up and down, and up and down. So there was no way we could sleep there. We called the front desk and complained. I asked the woman who took the call why this was not on the website, that all the grand suites abut the elevator. She said "if she had built the website she would have said that".. . This tells me that this is an ongoing problem with complaints. . . So their solution was a much smaller room and did not refund the extra monies we spent.. . Very disappointed with the hotel. We suspect a change in ownership... . DAY 2:. it is 2:12 and our room is still not cleaned, even though we put out the sign to service the room since 8:45 am.
Ok can't say I have stayed there.....however I have had dealings with the VIP hosts . J-Toy and Virginia. Both went way way out of their way to accommodate a request of mine.   Could not of made this happen with out their assistance.  They worked with me to make things happen even when didn't quite fit into their way of doing things.  Also btw everyone I spoke to at the hotel was super pleasant and tried to help.  J-Toy and Virginia just went really out of their way.    So thank u.    I will visit your hotel again thanks to the hospitality and courtesy I received.
Stayed for 4 nights in a Select guest room.  Room was clean, large and updated.  Did not try the main restaurants (a steakhouse, Italian restaurant and a 50's style diner) or the pool.   I did try the buffet which was perfectly fine and very reasonable ($21 for dinner and $18 for breakfast).  Food court was OK but could have had more options. The mall/shops are forgettable--skip those.  Was super disappointed in the  "free" Wi-Fi though.  You get 1mb free, after that you have to pay $10 (per day I think).  Does anyone just use 1mb?  I'm not saying people should download movies or anything, but I probably use more than 1mb just checking my email!  I mean,  come on now. . . Still, I think overall Stratosphere provides a pretty good bang for your buck.  Reasonable price and service, free parking is super easy....I'd recommend it.
I will not even give a rate to this hotel. I checked in 12/21/14. I called in to the front desk and ask them for a late check in. To my surprise when I got in about 11:05pm after a very long drive, as I checked in I was told that my room is not ready. Now the check in process was like 30 minutes and was told that they have front desk agent call in sick. A lame excuse. So I went to eat at their Roxy diner for the wait. To my airplane my food has a fly. Manager didn't do anything was told it will be credit for the food with fly and yet when I receive the bill it was there. This restaurant is a big fucking joke. Then when I finally got my room, the pillowcase smells like it has been used for weeks but the housekeeper insisted that the smell is the way it is. Management of this hotel should be fired and banned to work in a hotel.
Also wanted to say a big thank you to the food and beverage asst manager chad fisher.   Even after a small mis understanding he owned the mix up. Fixed it and then made it happen for me.  Well above and beyond.   Stratosphere is lucky to have people like these working for them.  Thank u chad
Really poor customer service I stayed here for 5 days they gave me a rate I asked the guy the next day would it be the same he said yes just come down and you'll be ok so I confronted a manager when the rate was not the same he told me sorry it's changed you want to stay or check out because the hotel is getting booked so screw u its busy low we don't need your business or care about what you were told pay more or leave I will never stay at this hotel again the proper thing would have been to say when I booked the rate changed daily / hourly to guarantee a specific rate one should book all at once otherwise we can't guarantee a rate not oh ok this is the rate were checking u out not the hotel is getting full so off to the flamingo I go where there is better customer service never again these two managers should be fired
The stratosphere is way out of the way situated at the north end of the strip, so it's easy to forget about it when booking trips. But with it's cheap rates and great views in the tower, I highly recommend it. It's an older hotel but I guess they are slowly renovating the rooms... or at least planning on it. As the strip gets builded up and the north end fills with higher end hotel casinos, my guess is that the Stratosphere will catch up to the times. Old School is no longer the Cool in Vegas.
I found bed bug when i woke up in the morning, i am so disappointed with the quality of the room. Also when i turned the heater on there was so much dust coming out of it!!!!
This place sucks. Found a cheap deal through Priceline and totally understood why it's cheap. The roomsare super old looking, they don't restock the toiletries and they really have to update their ventilation system in the casino. There's smoke everywhere and it's so hard to breathe.
When you first enter the tower area, you wait in line ( I waited on a Tuesday night 30 min) to get your picture taken on a green screen and to go through a metal detector.  Ladies - be ready to hand over your purse to the security worker(?) they actually look into your purse.  Gents -  take everything out of your pockets and your belt.  They won't let you through until the metal detector doesn't beep.  I kept beeping as I was making my way through the metal detector and the security worker made me stretch out my hands and passed a wand over me.... . After getting your picture taken, you go upstairs to the elevators.  From here I waited a good 15 minutes for an elevator to go up the tower.  A staff member will count 10 guests into the elevator at a time. (Total wait time to reach the top of the tower - 45 min).  . . I reached the inner observation deck area, with the slanted windows.  They had nice seating areas right next to the windows.  They also have a sandwich shop, souvenir store and bar.  . . It's always a treat to go up and see Vegas from the Stratosphere, I just felt the waiting time was a bit unreasonable.  Also, some sections of the inner observation deck were closed off for a private party.
At 4am this morning my car was hit and totaled in a car chase. I have called the hotel 3x to try and cancel my reservations for NYE tonight. I offered my police report, alternate days, they REFUSED to accommodate me in anyway and are charging me $400 for tonight. The manager said it is NYE and they are booked.... Doesn't that mean that they would have no prob booking the room, also that they will be making a ton of $$$ tonight. But still insist on charging me! Poor business acumen stratosphere. I am extremely disappointed and intend NEVER to stay there after feeling like I was robbed today. Lost my car, vaca, and $400.  Happy new year....
I would have never chosen this place to stay when in Vegas. Since turning 21, I've only gone to Vegas with my friends so we tend to stay closer to whatever club we intended on going to. As I was with my parents and kids my brothers age (aka 16-18), clubs were definitely not what we were concerned about. . . The Good: . The stratosphere itself is free to hotel guests. The lines aren't that long, guess it depends on when you go. You can get to the top pretty easily - 10 people to an elevator. Getting to the top was great. Stop off on floor 108 for the inside observatory and floor 109 for the outside. The inside was pretty cool. That's also where they have the bungee jumping - there was someone doing it when we were up there. Pretty awesome. The outside observation deck is cold in the winter, but the views are gorgeous up there! . . The bar at the 107 floor is pretty cool too. Definitely a cheap way to get to the top and see the views without having to pay all that money for the stratosphere. . . The bad: . Honestly, the location is just far from everything. Maybe except the SLS, which is still far from all the other hotels on the strip. It's just north, much more north than I thought. Since they're building resort world, it just seems so much further from everything right now. At any time, it's just about a $20 cab ride to the strip (even more if there's a ton of traffic). Then again, you could just drive yourself, but if you plan on drinking, it's not fun. . . The Ugly:. My mom ordered the deluxe room for the stay, but the other people ordered the premier room so my mom called the hotel to see how big of a difference it would be. They told her $15 per room per day. Not a big deal. Then, when we arrived, the price changed to $30 per room per day to upgrade and that was not what the hotel told my mom when she called. Anyways, after an hour wait and discussions with the manager (and some angry words from my dad), we got the hotel rooms as we thought. However, no strip view which is what was promised with the $30 extra dollars paid by our friends. Also, our rooms were not next to each other but close enough. Regardless, not happy by the time we made it into our rooms. . . Overall bad experience and probably never going to stay here again. it's not a bad hotel persay, but I like staying closer to all the fun and the amazing food!
