Music - Awesome if you like EDM. We came here for Sander Van Doorn...he was great!. Location - At the Cosmopolitan. Super convenient if you're staying at the center of the strip. We walked over from Planet Hollywood...nice easy walk. You will need to walk up several flights of stairs to actually get to the club. Good luck if you're wearing heels.. Dance floor - So small!!! I was shocked by how tiny the dance floor is. I understand that these clubs are geared towards bottle service and tables, but come on. The dance floor was way too crowded and way too small. Whoever designed this place clearly wasn't thinking straight.. Staff/service- The male bartender at the bar outside was great. Really nice guy. The female bartender by the elevator was very rude. The security people are kind of annoying...there was no more room on the dance floor and they didn't want anyone standing near the walkways or behind the VIP tables. So where do they expect us to go???? . Bathrooms - Clean. The ladies in the women's bathroom were very attentive, always had a paper towel ready for you after you wash your hands.. Drinks - Good. I was actually surprised by the prices. Drinks are very expensive in Atlantic City so I was expecting them to be even more expensive in Vegas. The prices really weren't that bad. And there wasn't a minimum to use a credit card. Maybe I was just ordering cheap drinks??? lol. Lines - There was no line to get in the club. We ordered tickets ahead of time though so I think that really helped. We walked in around 11:30pm. Lines for the bar weren't bad either.. Coat check - We didn't take advantage of this. We called ahead to find out the cost - $40 for guys, $20 for girls. That is INSANE. Who would pay that? I really hope that there was a miscommunication and that was the price to get in the club, not for coat check.. . I would come back here again, but only after I experience some of the other clubs at Vegas first.
Really ???????? You need a girl to get in to this club what??????? I think America is all equality but I think the this is a bullshit, discrimination is the first tool in this club, we know you probably don't care but this is really bad for tourist !
12 of us .. Bottle Service.. Great music... Small dance floor, but we had fun anyway.. . There were a lot of creepy, touchy, feely people.
This club helped me have the best Vegas weekend, so far. We saw Sander Van Doorn inside and he slayed, the place looks awesome, yeah it's crowded and you can't hang out in the aisle, so you have to keep it moving and/or get on the dance floor. I didn't mind. The outside is spacious and played hip hop, I liked it, cuz you could actually talk to people out there. The drinks were expensive....duh, it's Vegas, can't complain, I don't understand people who complain about the price of anything in this town really, it's Vegas, don't come if you can't afford it. This is the most heavily staffed club I've ever been too and enjoyed my interaction with them all around. The overall design of the club is what makes it so cool, it feels like you're in a movie. Go here, let your wallet go and dance. Thanks Marquee.
I hate this place Ahaha Seriously went on my Birthday and of course non-stop EDM and a very small Hip Hop room.
During the morning this club is paradise. They have amazing DJs and great table and cabana services. The day clubs have a open layout. However, the pools are warm... Despite the temperate of the pool, I always have a fun time! . . During the night the club is so crowded. By the end of the night they start to shut down parts of the club slowly and gradually by the end of night it becomes so crowded.
I went to this club on a Monday night. We got in through a promoter and didn't have to pay cover for me and 2 girlfriends. The music was fantastic with a dj spinning original tracks and mixes with a theme of candyland.. . Two story tall led effects wall with 5 female dancers in silhouette.  They gave out free light wands and had confetti cannons and fog machines with an icy blast keeping the dance floor cool. . . Great crowd with both locals and alot of cute foreigners with great accents. Met an Irish boy, some middle eastern gentlemen and a group of Scottish jocks. . .  Would be a 5 star rating but the drinks were expensive and weak. I don't mind paying for a strong drink, but a weak expensive drink is a no go.
I want to tell you first of all that we had a great time at the Cosmopolitan.  Great rooms, great casino, friendly staff.  3 of my friends stay at your hotel regularly.  It was my first time.. . However, the experience we had at Marquee was disgusting!!!  Justen and his staff should be embarrassed!!!. . As I mentioned in my earlier emails, I was looking for recommendations for a club with table/bottle service for 40-50 year olds as it was my friends 50th birthday.  You sent me to Justen.  I did not know he only worked for Marquee.   He said the club was perfect for us and he would set us up with a "great table".  I even tipped him $100 on the way in...  . . It was all 20 something patrons.  Not what we were told or even sold!!! They set us up with a table in the back corner by the bathroom.  It was horrible.  Couldn't have been further from the dance floor.  Not even in the ring. Then they triggered a fraud alert on my visa and they would not let anyone have any of the drinks even though they know we were staying in the hotel. What is that all about???   It took the waitress (Mary) over 30 minutes to re-process it. We were all standing there with our thumbs up our ass. . . Now the icing on the cake....Mary told me she was leaving for the night.  I signed the bill and included a 20% gratuity.  Then she comes back and asks for a tip for the bar back who kept up with the mixers etc...  She said the gratuity didn't include him.  I was so angry at that point that I just charged another $50 on my card.  Then I go to the bathroom and come back and our whole area was cleaned out and know one knew what was up.  I felt worked over and angry over the whole experience.  Disgusted!!!!. . The next day on check out neither of you were around.  They had some manager from Marquee call me and he said he would give me $50 towards my next visit to Marquee.  Seriously?????  . . You all should be embarrassed after us spending over $10,000 for 2 days.
Went on a Monday night for a free cocktail party. The free liquor was from 10-11 pm. My group got to the Marquee about 15 minutes earlier than that. First off, what is with the organization of the lines, or lack thereof. There was a bouncer who looked at our voucher and told us to go to line 1. We went to the ID checker and got to the cashier who told us we had to go to a different line, not letting us know which one. It took a bit to find someone that would help us and proceeded to line 2. We got checked in and waited for someone to let us in. By the time we got up to the bar area it was already 10:15. So they only had one floor open since it was Monday which was the table areas. If you didn't pay for a table you were packed in like sardines in the walkways or areas close to the bar. And the DJ only played techno music. I'm definitely not impressed with this place and think management needs better organization
Marquee was fun. I really liked how big the club was and all the cool decor. I really loved the outside part of the club and thought the cabanas in the pool looked good. I went on a Friday night and I was surprised by the music. Could have been better in my opinion.
Marquee is a very nice venue, but I did not like how crowded it gets inside. I liked the outside, where the pool is.  But inside I felt like I was being squished into a can of sardines. . . I went during my 21st birthday weekend to see Cedric Gervais here, and it was fun but I really shouldn't have worn terribly high heels! We ended up leaving early because we couldn't deal with the squished feeling. . . I do have to give them props for the photo booth and the well made drink! I ordered a Tokyo Tea and it was absolutely delicious and still got me tipsy! Best Tokyo Tea in Vegas. :)
Let me first mention I'm a Vegas local. . I have been to multiple clubs on the strip, plenty of times. On two different occasions I have been in a group where we have had our phones stolen on the dance floor. This has never happened to my me or my group of friends, anywhere else. The first occasion it was one girl and out of her purse. The second time THREE of us got our phones stolen on the dance floor (zipped inside purse pocket, front pocket of jeans, inside bra). Let me also mention that we were all sober. Within the half hour it took for us to cancel our phones, they had made calls to Colombia and switched my SIM card into 2 different phones. They were professional phone bandits! Watch your phones, guys! . Besides that.... Marquee has two stages. In the summer, there is the main EDM stage inside and a hip-hop stage outside. In the winter the outside portion closes off and the Boombox room, with hip-hop, opens up. The Boombox room is always packed, however the bar is easier to get to than the upstairs bar. The outdoor poker tables stay open even in the winter! . Get your name on a guest list, don't pay cover! If you're a group of girls, find a promoter to get you drink tokens!
I've been to many Las Vegas clubs, and this was by far the worst.. . Entry: As we came up the escalator, first thing we saw was Metro Cops everywhere (not casino security.  Then, there are multiple lines for different things, I'm not sure even the bouncers know what is what.  To round that off people were cutting in front of us across the ropes.  The bouncers checking the lists didn't even check ours, the girls we were with were amongst the hottest in line.  Once to the elevator they crammed us in like sardines.. . Club: After an elevator ride up, we entered the club which is on the roof of the Cosmo with indoor and outdoor areas.  The main dance floor is too small, no room to dance, lacks high-quality lighting and sound (Drai's, Wynn, and Rain are better.. . Drinks: We ordered the same drinks 3 times in a row and were quoted different prices each time, upon asking about this the third time, the bartender rudely said we got a receipt with each drink, we didn't...  ON top of that, the drinks are weak, not even worth buying.. . Crowd:  The crowd was rude and careless, two people in my party had drinks dropped near them.  Another had her own drink dropped by someone right after getting it, of course the bartender after seeing this told us he wouldn't replace it.. . Exiting:  We left early because the club sucked, we went to the elevators we entered through, we were rudely told we were not allowed to use these elevators and the exit was through the adjacent hallway.  So we went to the adjacent hallway and found out the exit was actually through the hotel's emergency exit stairwell.  The girls we were with both had high heels, so we had to carry them down the stairs for safety (approx. 4-5 flights). . I will never go back, this club is a disgrace for Las Vegas.
WATCH OUT FOR THIEVES!! OR MAYBE JUST DON'T GO TO THIS CLUB!! . . 3 of my friends had their phones stolen right out of their purses even though they were zipped up (and one was even a wristlet!). On top of that we talked with a few other girls that apparently had their phones stolen too. Security did absolutely nothing to help aside from ask you fill out a form in case they "found" or someone "turned in" the phone. . . Completely ruined the night and even before this happened, not a very good handle of crowd control on the main floor. Felt packed beyond capacity.
Our promoter was great. Went to Marquee for their ugly sweater holiday party. Never been clubbing in a sweater before that was awesomee. Free entrance and complimentary drinks (got like 6 AMFS) Music was good and fun to dance to. . . And then when we left my feet were hurting and Marquee gave us sandals =') . . . . marquee is now my fav club in vegas
So this is a world class night club. Big DJs, expensive drinks, packed house, people dressed to the 9's and dancing their brains out, etc. If that's your thing, then hit this place up. Pretty much only XS is better at this point. If the club scene isn't your thing, then why are you reading this?!
