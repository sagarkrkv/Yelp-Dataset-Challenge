Thanksgiving week, we had what I think was the smallest suite a 600 sq. ft. But for two XXL guys, this was more than adequate! We had a nice writing desk, a sofa, a nice bathroom and two sinks. Enough light to do a close shave, newer aircon system, wireless internet.
12 months later, and the Rio flatly denied any responsibility for my illness, and subsequent hospital visit that I still owe $1000 on. It's disgusting that they all but called me a liar.  Their own security wheeled me to a waiting to car, throwing up the entire way. I was nowhere else in Las Vegas my entire trip, and did not eat outside the hotel even once.. . Sad, because we had made the Rio our Christmas family getaway for the last two years. As the season approaches, we aren't making reservations at The Rio.. . Shame on you guys.
Awesome hotel! I knew it was all suites, but haven't stayed here in a while. Got the basic room, and it was ever so spacious with a fridge, big living room area, desk, huge bed, and enormous bathroom with separate door and sink for the toilet and shower. Best of all... a fully stocked Keurig coffee maker (rare these days in Vegas with most greedy hotels pulling coffee makers out to force you to go downstairs to their Starbucks in the lobby for coffee). Front desk service was also superb. Yeah it's not on the strip but who cares... they have a quick and easy frequent shuttle taking you to all the action for free. The "resort fee" kinda sucks... but you get FREE WI-FI, so really it's not that bad I guess. If not for that resort fee I would have given 5 stars for sure!
Awesome service and clean rooms. I wouldn't mind staying here again. I didn't like the carnival buffet though. I heard it was world class buffet, maybe on a world I have yet to visit. Congealed macaroni a cheese and old sushi is not my idea of world class. And the whole meal certainly wasn't worth $32.00. Other than the awful food, especially the over-price Chinese restaurant across the way, my stay was great. Will be staying there again and soon.
The hot water in the shower took 30 mins. It was so bad. I complained about that and they still didn't do anything
Concerning the shooting of armed robber in hotel on Dec. 7...Hotel operations, not interrupted? My daughter was staying at the hotel and was trampled by a panicked crowd, she was treated by a squeamish hotel EMT who said, her forehead gushing blood was making him nauseous! The hotel did not make sure she was taken to the ER and they had to take their own cab! The hotel did not bother to check on her or her friends who were also in the middle of the chaos.  Were they treated so poorly because they were young adults? She happened to be staying at this hotel because her Friend was celebrating his last USMC ball as an active duty Marine! Thanks for making it memorable for them, the staff could have shown a little compassion and offered some kind of assistance!. Sincerely, Mary Carter. Orlando, Fl
I've been at the Rio a couple of times and no matter how hard I try, I'll probably never love it. it's not that it's bad place to stay when you're in Vegas, but the whole place could really use a major overhaul, especially the suites themselves.. . I used to stay here for trade shows once or twice a year and if you're lucky, you can get a good value on the room. But as soon as something is happening at the Rio itself, better look elsewhere. This summer, I found rooms at the Four Seasons (!) for a cheaper price than a stay at the Rio during a conference - and that's another level of service and ambiance altogether.. . Again: As a cheap place to crash? Sure. As an actual "nice place" to spend your time, keep looking. Vegas has more to offer.
It's ok. Nice rooms, but a club on the 30 something floor going all night??? I'd stay again. Food was good at the deli at 2am. Nice location off the strip.
This hotel is one of the older ones but it's clean and the rooms on the high floors have great views .It's has shops and great pools with sand . So the pool are nice if you have children.
The Rio is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in Las Vegas.  The rooms are old, dirty and outdated.  I may have been able to deal with that, however, the shower head was the worst.  You could not take a shower due to the extreme pressure ( in one steady stream).  When I called to move rooms, I was told we could.  After packing  all of my stuff, I was moved to the same room, with the same horrible shower head.  Never again......
Great service to match the great resort fee room rate.  I recomnend the Rio Hotel and Casino to anyone that likes to stay closed to strip without actually staying on it.  Rooms are spasious and modern.  I would come back anytime.  got to see the MJ show which was grand
Lined up to adjusted expectations. Adjust your expectations to a 3 star casino off the strip that is older and you pretty much have the Rio. It was comfortable and fairly clean. Black Jack tables were ok limits were pretty high for the odds and some decent craps tables. Rooms were ok at the Samba tower. One plus was spa access was open with the resort fee. One minus was the steam room was closed for repair and jet in hot tub the same. I almost got the feeling they were closed for good or for staff convenience. Tip if you like Pho, Pho Da Nang served the best Pho I have ever had.
Slightly outdated, but large rooms.. . ROOM:. My friend booked the regular queen suite.  All rooms are suites so our room was huge.  In addition to the two queen beds, there was a living room area and a long counter space which also served as the bathroom vanity and included an in room safe and mini fridge.  Our room was clean but fixtures are clearly outdated.  Our bathtub was clogged and didn't drain fast enough so you feet sat in a pool of your shower water.  Our friend stayed on another floor and he said his room looked more outdated than ours.. . Housekeeping was a huge issue.  We were here during one of Vegas' biggest weekends of the year.  Before we went to dinner, I called housekeeping at 8pm to ask to clean my room.  They told me they didn't have time but they could bring us towels and toiletries.  People leave their rooms at all hours of the night so not being properly staffed at 8pm was ridiculous.  I said we would be leaving our room so they could come in and leave the towels on our bed.  When we got back a few hours later, I was appauled to see what had happened.  They left all the towels in front of our hotel door...ON THE FLOOR.  Disgusting and so unsanitary!. . Next time, I'd rather pay a bit more to stay on the strip at a place boasting better rooms and better service. . . WHAT TO KNOW:. *Located off the strip. *Rio charges a per night resort fee. *Free wi-fi...for one device (ridiculous only one device in my opinion). *11am check out but if you call down, they'll usually extend it to noon. *Complimentary shuttles that run to other Harrah's properties. *Complimentary valet parking and self parking areas. *Separate check in and check out lines for Total Rewards Members
The hotel and casino are alright. I like the large room and that the price for the room can be very reasonable if you book on the total rewards web site. The cons to this place is that anything food or drink related in this casino is waaaayyy overpriced!!! Example bag of chips is $6 in their snack store near the elevator. The buffet is 32$ mid week for dinner....the problem is that there is not any competition close by so they gotcha once you are there and want to eat.
I was charged $784.00 to replace a mattress that they claimed had to be replaced! I had to call them to find out that housekeeping said they found 'bio' on the mattress and had to throw it out. I did NOT mess up the mattress in any shape or form! No one seems to have any solid information either, and keep talking in circles. I'venever had such a horrible experience as a hotel guest. They can't provide me with any pictures or any specifics, and just expect me to bend over and pay for something I have nothing to do with.. . No managers available, no specific information, no evidence of a ruined mattress, nothing.... . I've stayed in hotels all around the world for most of my life, I've never ruined any hotel property or have been charged for any sort of destruction. I've never felt so cheated by a hotel in my life. . . I wish I had looked for reviews on this hotel before I booked because I would've rather stayed at a cheap hotel off the strip than be robbed like this. Unbelievable...
So normally I don't really review places other than eating establishments, but this review seemed necessary after the craziness that went down my first night in Rio.. . It's 6am and I can't sleep. The time difference has not been my friend. I get up, and decide i'll waste some time at the gym. As I exit the elevator that connects the hotel rooms with the actual casino floor I am suddenly met by a big black sheet that spans the entire width of hall way. Along with the ominous sheet is: a handful of casino security, 3 or 4 metro police officers, and very tired looking casino managers. Everyone immediately points to an "employee's only" door to my left and directs me through. I walk down winding hallways, at each checkpoint another police officer pointing out the proper directions. Eventually I get out to the casino floor, and I notice another black sheet. Apparently I had just taken a detour via staff-only hallways in order to avoid a small portion of the main hallway that leads to the elevators.. . So I decide that it is best to not hang around and I start to head to the gym, only to be met by police tape. Now I was a little more curious. I ask the guard what happened, and she immediately cut me off and insisted she "could not talk about it at this time." So, me being the savvy millennial I am, I pull out my phone and google the Rio. Turns out undercover security shot an alleged "repeat offender" who was attempting to the rob the casino. A man was killed my first night in Vegas.... Definitely a story to tell.. . At first Rio really did not handle this well. They didn't accommodate the people trapped out of their rooms (once you left your room and came downstairs, police wouldn't let you back up. "Security measure"....I was locked out for about 5 hours.). . my boyfriend and I weren't too angry about being locked out of our room because we were sure the hotel would be accommodating their customers and giving them things to do as they waited to back into their room. This just seemed like pretty basic crisis communications. When we went to talk to the manager though, this was not the case.. . The hotel managers and staff wouldn't actually listen when we spoke to them. They just kept droning over and over, "we cant let you up into your room, once metro is involved we have no control." This wasn't what we were asking though. We didn't NEED to get to our room, we just wanted something to do while we waited. We weren't the only ones either. People started getting really heated when they found out the hotel wasn't offering any kind of distraction. Eventually though, with quite a bit of complaining the hotel finally started giving people champagne brunch vouchers and waiving hotel fees.. . It was too late though for me. Having graduated with a marketing degree, I know this first thing about marketing is to keep the customers happy. Angry customers can only lead to trouble. By the time the hotel finally connected the dots too many people were mad. . . Overall this is a very long way of saying Rio needs to remember that at the end of the day, if the customer isn't happy: you aren't doing your job.
This hotel is wonderful! First of all, all the staff we encountered were super-friendly, helpful and nice! Great customer service! Gorgeous huge room with incredible view! Very clean, great amenities, all around thumbs way up!!!
This review is specifically for the All American Bar and Grille in the Rio Hotel.. . We came on Thanksgiving night and it was our worst meal and service we had during our week long stay in Vegas.. . I get that the servers probably were loathing the fact they were working on Thanksgiving night... However, you don't need to show your customers your anguish and lack of manners.. . Food was mediocre at best, which was surprising considering the Rio buffet has such a good rep.... . Our server though avoided us for most of the night, was non social, and could have cared less about our experience... . . Not a good way to treat your customers.
This casino isn't directly on the strip, but I almost preferred it. For one, you get a beautiful view of said strip from the top deck of Rio's parking garage.. . It has the classic gaudy bright colors. It looks less updated than other casinos, but I preferred the general layout better. It was pretty easy to navigate. In particular, I loved the balcony like top floor that wrapped around the edges. It gave a nice view of the casino floor.. . Went to see Penn and Teller, which was amazing. We wanted to eat at Hash a Go Go, but it has limited hours. Otherwise, I wasn't as impressed with the food options.
Good and affordable hotel in Las Vegas. It is an all suit hotel with king, 2 queen beds rooms. There are sofa beds (not good at all) or rollaway beds. Quick note:The beds are a bit old and saggy.. . The casino is average but comfy. I like the rate at which drinks are being served at the table: a bit faster than other casinos and one of the reasons I'm giving the props for. . . There is a shuttle bus to Ballys in case you are not driving or don't want to get a cab.. . Rooms are pretty close to the main entrance, that's a big plus too. . . Good luck !!
I've stayed here over ten to fifteen times over the past 5 years.  Sometimes for up to three weeks at a time.  But I am fed up with the nickel and diming.  . The last straw was the throttling of the internet down and an extra fee for higher speeds.  Is it not enough that we get charged for it in the resort fee?  . I could barely check emails and god forbid I tried to surf two pages at the same time.  For a good connection I'd have to shell out another $8.99 per day in addition to the $25.99 resort fee.. No thanks.
A decent hotel, the room is nice and big with no complaints to the room. Other than the overly price of vending machine drinks, $5 for water, seriously? And the lack of any recreational activitys its a average casino place. Would this hotel be recommended for kids? Not at all so don't bring your kids with you here. Buffet was nice a little pricey but very worth it.Overall decent, nothing too special oh and the wifi is indeed free here.
Large room, ok bed, worn out sofa.  Lousy shower.I booked the room because it was a good price and Expedia rated it as ****. Not four star hotel. The food at the hotel was lousy, won't return to the Rio
This is a legit hotel for the bargain price. I booked through Priceline and underbid for $42/night plus taxes and resort fee in late December. I saved 75% easy and for that I give the Rio a decent review. The room was clean, you don't get any amenities like free coffee, water bottles or any of that... You pay for it all here. There was a bar of soap leveling a table, kinda ghetto but it's not a five star resort neither. The crowd here is old and families period, you may see some young twenty something here but mainly foreigners. It's a legit and safe hotel period. I suggest booking through Priceline and underbid for the area you want to stay, if you get rejected you don't get charged... Beats paying retail value.
First time checking out the RIO. . . Although this hotel is not located on the strip they provide a great free shuttle service to Bally's and Harrahs (it runs about every 30 minutes to 1am).  It took us about 20 minutes to walk to the Strip.. .  Every employee we interacted with were friendly and knowledgeable. Our room was one of the newly renovated rooms in the masquerade tower. It was very clean and quite large although we could faintly hear the bar (?) even on the 37th floor.  . . We only ate at the American Grill for lunch on our first day, it was a good veggie burger option, cold beer and great bar service.  . . When we travel to Vegas we want a clean comfortable room... at the end of the day the Rio delivered.
This would have been a four star review if a few things would have been better. We never had a hot shower in the 3 days there. Water turned all the way to hot was barely lukewarm. When we called to complain they asked if we let the water run for 15 minutes---unacceptable. The fridge was missing a leg so was wobbly.  . Room was extremely spacious and comfortable with a large sofa and a higher qualify tv. The bed was comfortable and had a wonderful  sleep on it. The room was a bit noisy as we had traffic noise despite being on 19th floor. Wifi was included in resort fee which made the $28.00 somewhat palatable despite pools being closed for winter.
Rooms are nice.   Staff is so so.    Would never stay again.  Hidden fees.   Also checked in at 8 am.  Couldn't get us in, understandably...   But gave away room after room...  didn't get us in till 8pm.   Then charged a late fee of 60$   We even had a party of 14 people with 7 rooms and no type of discount...   Which is no big deal.   But.    When you stay off the strip, in a old run down hotel to stay together with a group there should be some sort of appreciation.  Or at the very least a room you paid for months in advance.
Wow. Our room was Great.. Large, Clean, Well Laid out.. The View was Outstanding.. The service was good and helpful . and the food was Great.. Went to the PENN & TELLER SHOW Christmas Eve was Fantastic.. Spent Three nights including Christmas Eve And Christmas Day and enjoyed every minute.. Will be back again.
I had to wait 45 minutes to check in; not acceptable.  They had 5 and then 4 windows out of 15 open.  Not cool at all.  Rooms were large and spacious. Our non-smoking room smelled like it was really non-smoking and not a room that was converted from smoking to noon-smoking.  Staff was not friendly,  In fact they were downright grumpy.  At midnight I started hearing a lot of noise and music from the room next door; paper thin walls.  I got out of bed and went next door to ask then to quiet down and I saw a cleaning crew cleaning the room.  when I told them that they woke me up and asked them to quiet down, they did not even apologize.  Small bank of elevators and a couple were not working, so there was a lengthy wait time to get up and down the elevators.  Security was helpful; helped me find my car (it was in a different parking structure).  For a reduced price from what is available on the strip, if you can deal with mediocrity, then the Rio will suit you fine.
