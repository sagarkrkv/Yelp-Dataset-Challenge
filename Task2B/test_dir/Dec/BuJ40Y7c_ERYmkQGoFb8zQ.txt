Thought we were going to have a problem when we checked in as the desk clerk was rude. However by the end of the process she seemed to warm up. The first trek to the room was never ending. After going back and forth a couple of times we got used to it and didn't need the gym. The room was okay. The cleaning staff had left a container of mildew removal on the bathroom counter and some trash on the floor when we arrived. We were unable to connect to the wifi and the shutters didn't keep out the light. We booked through Expedia so for the price it was okay.
This hotel exceed our expectations.  We stayed four nights over Thanksgiving.  The rate was very cheap.  . . The hotel was clean and had ample amenities.  The staff was attentive and helpful.  Overall everything was great.
DO NOT STAY HERE! I have had better treatment at a Motel 6. Your personal belongs are not safe here. We shall be seeking legal representation in regards to our appalling stay. Expect damage to your property and them not to take any responsibility for their staffs actions.  Upon my stay I waited close to an hour to check in to a room that I paid for over TWO MONTHS AGO. The staff was unfriendly, and the doorman sexually harassed on our way out during our first nights stay.  Not one staff member was able to give me any direction to and from places in or around the hotel.  I was not told where my room was, it was left to wander the hotel.  Security was unfriendly, I sat at a penny slot (I am 26 years old) after walking around aimlessly throughout the casino waiting for my room, and was treated like a juvenile that broke a law.  Housekeeping damaged my friends Cartier watch she specifically took off and left in the room so it would not be damaged.  Upon complaint after complaint they were unapologetic and lacked any sort of empathy.  I was asked why it wasn't put in the safe. I didn't realize I had to put my luggage in a small safe.  Your belongs are probably safer at a crack motel on the other side of the freeway.
Boring hotel. But their in room dining is good!. Try the hot chocolate, omlette, french toast.
We have not received appropriate compensation, my friend is still left with a broken watch.
My wife and I came to Las Vegas (first time for both of us) for an anniversary trip from Dec 6 - Dec 8, 2014. We booked the room through Priceline, and were pretty happy to get it for $100/night.. . Check-in is 3pm. We arrived at 2:58pm and went to the Hilton Honors desk. The girl there was very nice (Marilu, I think?) but told us we could either have a 2-queen room right away, or the 1-king room we requested in about 45 minutes. We opted to wait 45 minutes and left our bags with the doorman. Oh, and we discovered there's a $22/night resort fee to cover discounts on stuff we don't want to buy, and the fitness center we don't use, and 2 bottles of water.. . When we came back, we got our key for the 12th floor in "the Tower". That's the place where you walk through the casino, up the escalator, down a LONG hall, then up an elevator and down that hall to your room. If you don't like the smell of cigarette smoke, you will hate the walk to get to your room.. . The room itself is ... disappointing. Nothing terrible about it, but nothing to wow me, either. No in-room mini-fridge, no coffee maker, no microwave. They do have a clothes iron and hair dryer. The lamps have a single power outlet, but I've stayed in worse hotels that have two or more power outlets and/or USB outlets accessible on the nightstands. The decor is pretty plain, the computer table is the weirdest afterthought I've ever seen, and there are only 5 dresser drawers, which would be tough for more than two people to make use of. The water bottles that we're effectively paying $44 for aren't even full-sized water bottles. And our window overlooks the airport. I assume that's what we got because we got a room at a discounted rate.. . While we were getting ready to head out about an hour and a half after getting to the room, someone knocked on our door and opened it. I was literally standing 2 feet from the door when she knocked, and didn't have time to get to the door before she opened it. She realized we were in there (partially undressed, I might add, but none of the good bits exposed), and closed the door. I opened it to ask who she was and what she wanted, and she said "room check" and said she works for the hotel. I called security and was told it was probably just housekeeping. I asked why housekeeping would be coming to our room after we checked-in, and was told she was probably just checking to see if the room had been serviced. Shouldn't housekeeping KNOW they already serviced a room a little over 2 hours earlier and it is now occupied? . . Then I had to get online to find dinner options, directions, etc. The WiFi login screen looks like it says you get 24 hours free, and then it's $10/day. But I called the front desk, and they told me it is free for the entire stay, and there's a page you get to that you can select the "free tier" and enter your name and room number to be granted access. I did that and discovered it's the worst WiFi I've used in at least 10 years. I got 1Mbps down, 0.25Mbps up. I literally had dial-up modems in the late 90's that matched those speeds. I thought I'd just use my cellular signal and tether from that instead, which is when I discovered I barely get any cell signal in my room. It's there, but I wasn't able to use it to even get my gmail to sync.. . The room was also very warm when we got there, so I cranked down the thermostat to 65 and we left. We went to Biscayne for dinner (which I reviewed separately - 4 stars), then to a couple shows and saw some sights around the south end of the strip. When we got back to the room several hours later the room was still at least 75 degrees or so. I called maintenance and was told they could send someone up to see if it's something they could fix. I asked her to be straight with me if it's a known issue they can't fix, because the hall was hot, too, so it didn't seem like a "my room" problem. She told me they had several A/C units "red-tagged", and maintenance wasn't told why, but they couldn't do anything with those units. She didn't know if mine was one of those or not, but told me a maintenance member could come find out. She said it would be up to half an hour before they would even know if they could fix it, and if they could, probably at least another 45 minutes before it would be fixed. She said I could just open a window, since it's cool outside, and they would have someone come the next day while we're out. So we've got the windows open, and it is finally cooling off. Unfortunately, that means we hear sirens blaring very loudly when they drive by (which is surprisingly frequent).. . How bad is this place? Bad enough that I'm sitting in the room at 1am (which is 4am my time) on the first night we arrived, while my wife is asleep, writing this review. Who knows what I might encounter in the next two days.
I've upgraded my review to two stars. The next day, when I got back to the room, it was still hot. The operator told me that the work request had been closed, so maintenance had visited the room, but she couldn't tell me if it had been closed because they thought they fixed it, or because it couldn't be fixed - all she could do was offer to send someone to look at it again. In the end, she transferred me to the front desk, where Yolanda (I think?) was very genuinely apologetic. She offered to transfer me to another room, but I only had one night left in the room, so I opted to stay (it would have been a bigger hassle to repack, move, and unpack, than just open the windows overnight again). She did offer to remove to the "resort fee", and when I asked for a late checkout, she gave that to me with no problem, which was actually very helpful.. . The problems continued, but in the end, at least the staff was willing to do whatever they could to make up for the problems. I still don't think I'd stay here again, though.
We stayed 3 nights during the National Finals Rodeo.  They forced an add on of $20 per night for the use of certain amenities (internet, web, phone, fitness room), we told them we didn't want the use of any of those and they said they had to add on the $20 fee, no choice.  Second, during our 3 day stay, there were personal items stolen from our room.  Third, rumors from talking with people turned out to be completely true, the Tropicana hotel's slot machines were the tightest machines on the strip.  We rate the casino service a ZERO.  Not one server came by.  We finally walked over to one of the bars to order a beverage and after waiting for service over 20 minutes (while standing right in front of the spot where they make the drinks) in a bar that was not that busy, we left and walked over to the MGM which is right across the road.   MGM was completely different, good food, good service, good atmosphere.  The female employees at the Tropicana were dressed extremely inappropriately.  It's difficult to truly offend me but I was offended and embarrassed for those women.  A terrible experience, we will NEVER stay there again.  Don'tbe fooled by the reasonable price to stay there, they add on more fees upon check in.  Cigarette smoke was thick throughout the hotel....
The New Tropicana...... The room we got was very spacious, even though we didn't a strip view it was a view of the airport. The beds were very comfortable.. Only reason that I'm not giving them 5 stars it's because the "free" internet is limited to 1MB every 24hrs. So I don't know if that's what you get when you book with free internet.
First time staying at the Tropicana and it was very nice. The slots were paying out more than expected. Probably because they want to attract more people to play at their casino.. The rooms were very nice and comfortable. The air conditioner took some time to cool down so we left it set to 68 degrees the whole time.. Watched the Illusions Magic Show and enjoyed that experience.. I would recommend it especially for the price of the stay.
smells great...very nice rooms....great resteraunts...very very few kids seen here!get a host to take extra good care of you. Always come here and not one complaint from me. If you don't want the extra crowded casinos for their gimmicks then come to the trop. Guraanteed tables to play without overcrowded population. The live band at night is awesome too.
I booked my reservation as 2Queen beds. When I checked in, they are out of 2 queen beds. They explained to me that its first come, first surge. So how come you guys makes us have choice when we make reservation!? This is just ridiculous and I never had those kind of policy. They are sucks and not professional. Even Expedia should have note about it.
Don't bother with the JFK exhibit. It's overpriced and has very few items. This is a ripoff.
This review is based solely on my interaction with the Spa manager Jorge Alverado....not that he actually wanted to give me jus last name. --however he was wearing a name tag. And to finally answer your question no this will not be a good review. . . I stayed in the hotel shortly before Christmas 12/19/2014 thru 12/21/2014. A short trip to celebrate a 35th birthday.  Easy to do when you live in Los Angeles.  First off we got there late. At 1 am.  No issues there our rooms were available and the front desk staff was friendly and fast.  We dropped our bags off at the room and hit the bar and the tables.  Fun night all the way around.  . . I call down to the front desk to get the hours of operation for the Spa and am told its closed along with the pool and buffet for renovations. Fine no need to get up at 10am if I can't soak in the hot tub   On my way out to go to the buffet at the Palms. What do my eyes see?   An open spa....WTF?  So we stop in talk to the girl at the front desk.  Get a tourand correct hours of operations and pricing.  We contemplate staying because she was so nice and helpful. However hunger won out and we went to eat.  Of course once again we stayed at the Palms drinking and gambling the night away. . . But at 3am we make a pact to go to the spa at 9 am Sunday morning. My friend already there, pays her $10 to get in.  So it's my turn and the price is $20.  Um why?  So here's where client service takes a jump out the window. . . As I'm explaining to the guy at the desk Jorge what happened and how I got the $10 quote. He shrugged his shoulders claps his hands and tells me it's $20. And that's it. 5 minutes later and I'm sick of his attitude. So I ask to speak to the manager.  I kid you not this fool is the manager.  So now I'm like this is the manager? Of a spa? A place that makes the bulk of its money on customer service?  This is who they have in charge of the desk?  Finally I ask why the difference in price? Instead of answering the question I was met with a question "don't you know you are not paying the resort fee?"  Really...at this point my friend is like we should just go to a different spa....  . . To this the attendant Laura said we can give her a refund...and now knowing money is going to be lost Jorge finds a way for me to get in for the $10.  Damage done though.  That facial and message package for $215 that was to be my Christmas present from my husband not spent.  Tropicana you can thank Jorge for that loss of revenue directly. . . I did spend $30 on the neurobed. That is something I would recommend to anyone who visits. . . I also logged a complaint that day at the front desk. Along with this review and an email I will also be sending in.  . . So thanks Jorge I came back to Los Angeles and was able to get my facial and message at Burk Williams...and my husband also brought me a three day spa pass. So I got much more out of this than I would have due to you lack of professionalism and manners
Terrible Terrible Terrible experience!. . We checked in on Sunday afternoon for 2 nights. The hotel was basically empty. We had 2 rooms booked for the nights. One room seemed to be ok until we saw the cracks in the bathtub that just seemed to be falling apart. I could probably live with that seeing as the rooms were fairly cheap. What really threw us off was the second room. It was incredibly humid. We asked to changed rooms or at least bring a fan to the room and after promising the fan would be up at some point in the next 45 minutes we never received a fan in the room. Needless to say that we couldn't sleep much that night in that room.. . Bad service, bad rooms, uncooperative staff. I won't be back here in the future.
Love the lounge and the band Jamm they are the best! Nice open airy lounge with plenty of places to sit. Bartenders are friendly and service is excellent. One suggestion..I tried to google the days bands play and only find lounge hours. It would be helpful to have this information online f
Best service ever. Security is always on point. Tommy and Trenice Hanger working the graveyard shifts -- both deal with "shit" of what the world treats las vegas as and makes things work out for the better. -- definitely a place to consider, as well as a bonus or raise for the both of them. -- the "invisible" who make vegas safe for you. -- the sidelines who make the border of a piece always look better. --thank you. i only hope for the best. thank you.
