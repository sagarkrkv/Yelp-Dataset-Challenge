I was impressed with the rooms and the location.  I was pleased that there was not a casino at this location.  These are the pros. When we arrived, I placed my luggage on the kitchen counter since it was higher than the table (and I'm tall so it was easier to look in it). Unfortunately when they turned the unit,  they left the electric stove top on but it doesn't turn red so I didn't know it was on.  Part of my luggage was touching the stove top and it caught on fire.  They reimbursed me for the damages and they were semi caring.  What was worrisome was that the room filled up with smoke and the smoke alarms never went off! I am concerned that this may happen again in the future and something tragic happens.  My next call will be to the fire marshall!
3.5 stars.. . It's a clean hotel. No smoke and it smells great. This hotel is usually the hotel of choice for my coworkers and I when we go to Vegas. Valet is pretty quick and the walk isn't too far to front desk and guest elevators.. . The bath tub is a bit small for me (I'm 6'2). . There isn't any good options for coffee though and it gets kind of boring at night since there isn't a casino. I usually just walk to Aria for that.. . Wouldn't be my most ideal choice for a hotel stay but when I get special rates I would definitely stay here.
It really breaks my heart to write a three-star review of Vdara. The hotel promises SO much. Cool lobby, no smoking or gambling...bright and light. The problem exists in the rooms themselves:. . Why have kitchens when you don't supply kitchen supplies? We asked three times at the front desk for them, finally called down to get some, and then the housekeeper comes in with plates and glasses. Another trip...then we get a pot and a pan. Oh, and NO wine glasses in the suite. Really? We have to ask for those, too...and then housekeeping takes them the next morning.. . The upholstered chair and couch were dirty. The bed was immaculate, though.. . There wasn't any dishwashing detergent, sponges or towels for cleaning the dishes.. . Had to call downstairs to find the blow dryer (immediate thought was that there wasn't one). . . I guess we got spoiled with the level of service at Encore, where every need is anticipated. Vdara felt like they were just hoping that no one would ask for things.. . On the good side, the location is great...right next to Aria, close to Cosmopolitan (great happy hours), walkway to Bellagio. . . Special kudos to the servers in the Marketcafe--service (and food) was amazing.. . One tip--wine in the store connected to the Marketcafe is cheaper than Whole Foods, so save your money and buy there.. . Will we be back? Probably not. Too bad because the view in our room was amazing (corner suite facing the Bellagio fountains).
Best hotel I have ever stay! we only spent one night there, and we really had a great time. Everything in this hotel was prefect. There was no casinos so no one smoking inside the build, that really made it a better place than other hotels here. Our room was at 49th floor, it have a great view to the lake, that was amazing.. . Room was prefect, great indoor decor, 3 TVs, 2 big ones in bedroom/living room, the other smaller one was in the bathroom. Bed was good and comfortable, there was a nice tub in the bathroom, I love that tub, time run faster when I was in that tub.. . Check in/out was easy and fast, valet parking is free. Wifi is super.. . Only thing bothered me a little was hard to find a exit to street, good thing is tons of taxis out there.. . I will go back.
Just got back from 2 nights in Las Vegas at the Vdara. For people who are not gamblers or smokers and want a quiet refuge from that, the Vdara is your place.. . Check-in/Check out was quick, organized and easy. Stayed in a deluxe suite, which was large enough for 2 people. There is a small kitchenette that includes a fridge and a stovetop.. . Pool area is fairly small, but still nice. The bar/cabanas were closed for winter. Not a lot in terms of dining at the Vdara. You can get food at the lobby bar. There's also a small market and a Starbucks in the hotel. But for any real dining, you are better off going to the Aria next door.. . Vdara is part of the MGM conglomerate, which includes Aria, Bellagio, MGM Grand, etc. So, entertainment and dining across those properties is easily put on the room bill. We had a $50 food and drink credit-- and they wound up comping our food at Julian Serrano next door in the Aria--which came to about $65.. . Parking is really easy, should you have a car. Valet is free and quick.. . This was my first time in Vegas. I'm not a gambler, or into clubbing, and have a low tolerance for the d-baggery associated with "The Strip". For me, Vdara was close to perfect.
Absolutely love this hotel! You can always find a good deal and I always get upgraded!! This hotel is very modern and beautiful...Vdara has no casino but u can walk across to Aria to gamble .....It's quiet and always smells nice...They actually pump Vanilla air freshner into the vents to make the hotel smell fabulous .....It's at City Centre which I love and it's in the middle of everything....They also have free parking/valet with your stay....The service is always top notch too!
My favorite place to stay in Vegas hands down!!! It's perfect for the kids because of the no smoking and no casino, however you are super close to the Aria if you feel like winning some money ;-).
Where to begin... This review is based on my most recent visit to Vdara (during the Thanksgiving week).. I had stayed in Vdara in the past and had nothing but good things to say about the resort - good rates, cleanness, great service, amazing view, perfect deco, location etc.. . Ever since we stayed in Vdara (we've stayed practically everywhere else on the strip and Aria was our favorite so far), we don't even bother looking into other hotels since.  Sometimes a bad hotel experience could ruin the entire trip, so this had saved us a lot of time and effort searching for a place to stay whenever we visit LV (I usually go to LV at least 2~3 times a year).. . However, our most recent visit ended in disaster after we had encountered... BED BUGS (or it could be some other type of bugs).  It is hard to believe that there could be bed bugs in a resort such as this, even I had doubts... but it happened.. . We had stayed 3N/4D and on the second night, I folded out the sofa bed and slept on it.  In the morning next day, I had noticed certain rashes on both of my legs and on my friend's stomach (her daughter also had rash on her thighs - they both used the sofa bed to watch TV the night before).  We first thought it might be something in the linens and asked the housekeeping to look into it before going out to lunch.  Although we had requested for housekeeping on three different ways - 1) left the housekeeping light "on", 2) notified the housekeeping who came by earlier that we need it during lunch, and 3) requested to the front desk while waiting for valet.. . However, when we had returned to our room, the housekeeping still had not come byyet.  Once we called, they came after almost an hour wait and we had to wait for another half hour or so waiting for them to finish.  Later that night, my rash had gotten worse and it even started to bleed in certain places.  Then it started to sting and the pain was unbearable... it literally felt like I was being stung by dozens of bees at once.  My gf suggested that I filled the tub with warm water and put my legs in for a while, which eased the pain a bit.  Other still had minor rashes, but mine was the worst (I was the only one who slept on it all night).  Once the pain had gotten little better, I spent the last night of my trip sleeping on the floor (everybody was too tired and we didn't want to bother switching rooms or deal with it since we were leaving the next morning).. . Next day when I was checking out, I made a quick visit to the front desk to notify what had happened and showed them the pictures of my leg which I had taken over the night before.  The front desk called the manager because this was a "security protocol" who had asked me to make a statement with their security dept.  We were on our way out and the valet had already pulled out our car so we were in a hurry but they said it will only take a minute so I decided to wait.  While waiting for the security officer the manager took off the resort fees as courtesy... SERIOUSLY?!  I was in pain all night and practically ruined my last night of our trip and he took $28/day off for our stay?!  The funny thing is that when I headed to the front desk, I was not expecting any kind of comp because of this, I solely did it because we thought it's something they should be aware of.  But when they took off the resort fee and made it seem like it was a huge comp they were giving us, then the whole thing just felt like an insult.  On top of that, we had waited for over 15 minutes and the security officer still had not shown up.  I told the front desk that we need to leave, and she had offered that she'll have someone call me for the statement shortly.  The funny thing is that it's been weeks and I still haven't received a call for a statement.  And it was the hotel who NEEDED the statement, not me.. . We really did enjoy staying in Vdara in the past and there's a good chance that we'll most likely stay there on our next trip, but the most recent stay/incident made it seem very difficult to make such decision easily nor recommend to others (which I have done so since we first stayed).  . . Again, it really is a great hotel with exception qualities but I do not recommend using their sofa bed or if you do, just keep an eye out if you noticed unusual rash or marks on your skin soon after.
I will keep this short and very sweet.  This was my husband and my first stay at Vdara.  Starting with the VIP curbside greeting, we knew we were at home. The smell of the lobby is like heaven. The fragrance is very spa-like, but sweeter.  (unlike the stinky smoky, casino lobbies) The staff took such great care of us.  The 46th floor Corner View suite was fabulous and very CLEAN.  Housecleaning was nice and they took care of the room twice am/pm and even had our slippers and bottle water waiting bedside. what a nice touch!  Checkout was nice and easy.   James A. (bellman) was superb.  We can't wait to return!   I highly advise you "Do Vegas differently".   I always looked forward to coming home to a sweet smelling, luxurious haven at the end of the day.. . Vdara and Aria is the new Vegas.  I'm spoiled.  :)
Hands down on this great Hotel.. . . If your not into crowded people .. This is your right Hotel... . If your into Family Vacation with kids.. This is your Hotel... . If you hate Smoking...This is your Hotel. . I Booked my Hotel at Mlife at the Bellagio for 4 nights...Deluxe Fountain View...But after 1 day....I told my friends I need to moved out. I feel tight at Bellagio..( Don't get me Wrong. Bellagio is one of my Favorite) Except the walk towards our room FAR..and the Smoking people at the Casino annoys me. (Gone are the Elegance my Mom Told me). . . Thumbs up on Vdara: Quick Check-In.                                    Impressive Room ( Big).                                    Bathroom!!!  Mega Clean.                                    Smoke Free? ( Not sure but most people I've  seen  looks Decent). . I just book my room at Vdara on the Second Night at Bellagio. The Deluxe Room was very impressive....... . Only Complaint i had was the Next room (Ghetto Partying people at 3am) Gee...Im used to partying out of the Hotel (XS and Tryst) .When I'm done .. Hotel was supposed to be like your home to rest ..I called to Security..(No offense Again ..but if you can't afford to go Clubbing Id go somewhere ELSE).. . Overall ...Id Suggest Vdara for its Location. Big Clean New Rooms...What else can I say...Book Here to Experience what i Had...
The rooms here are beautiful, exactly what you would expect from a high-end hotel in Las Vegas. Although some complementary coffee in the room would have been nice.  Other than that, our stay was comfortable and pleasant.
Usually stay at Aria but decided to try something new for a coworkers mini bachelorette getaway. . . -First of all, there is no self park and to even FIND the location was a task for us Vdara newbs. We drove around and around in circles after missing the tiny sign 3 times lol. On top of that, a very unhelpful lady on the driveway told us self parking was on las vegas blvd all the while never glancing at us and playing on her phone the whole time. So not knowing that she meant the Aria self parking we drove around again until we self googled and realized there is NO SELF PARKING! Only comped valet!. . -The lady at the front desk was nice and upgraded us to a room with a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains, the LINQ ferris wheel. Housekeeping and room service were all super prompt and friendly when I "thought" I couldn't open the drapes...(I was just too dumb to operate the switch). . -The room itself was pretty spacious with a king bed..(not sure) and a couch which doubles as a bed. While the bathroom has a walk-in shower and a separate cute tub with not so great shampoos/conditioners.. A mini stove, microwave, and sink comes equipped with the room and I believe pots are available upon request so its nice if you want to stay in and cook yourself a homey dinner -.- . . Overall, the place is clean and pretty awesome so I'd probably stay here again but NEVER again park at Aria and try to walk over because its super tedious!
Vdara is one of the hotels that my husband and I love staying for our mini vacation every month. Sometimes we would come here two to three times a month. All pleasure no business. We called Las Vegas our second home because we come here so often. This hotel is very modern, clean and services are awesome! Love this place. Can't wait to come back again.
It is not you can hear the freeway, or that there is no coffee, or that the lights are dark, it is the view into the other guys room that are this place s rip off.  Who could possibly want to stay in a hotel with such a view.  The architect must have been stoned.  Worst hotel I have been too in Vegas....
My husband and I just got back from a 4 night stay here and we loved it ! . . Check in was easy and FAST ... maybe we just got there at the right time (4pm). Very friendly and accommodating front desk. When inquiring about late check out, we were given it complimentary for a two hour extension. Not standard, but don't hesitate to ask ! . . Our room was on the 33rd floor, was very spacious and had a great view of the Bellagio Fountains and the Strip. We had several friends staying in Vegas at the same time all over the strip, and we by far had a better room and view. Bed was soft, but comfortable. Nice large bathroom, with separate shower and bathtub. Large kitchenette, with mini bar, refrigerator, microwave and something like a stove (hotplate set up). Also has a table and two chairs if you choose to dine in. Living area with sofa and chair, coffee table and separate TV from the one in the sleeping area. Overall, large, beautiful, and clean room. . . The Vdara is part of the city center, and it can be hard to navigate your way to the Strip. We made the mistake of going through Aria a few times and it takes forever. We quickly learned that the hotel has a walkway to the Bellagio, and it put us in a much better position on the strip. On average, it took about 10 minutes to get from the hotel through the Bellagio walking, no more than 20 minutes to get to the Flamingo/Bally's.. . If you want to be in the center of all the action, this hotel is not for you. But if you want a beautiful, relaxing place to go back to after a day or night out in Vegas, than stay here ! We ordered takeout at 4am and there is something to be said about just going down the elevator to pick it up at the front desk rather than taking a 20 minute walk through a casino to get there :)
I LOVED the Vdara! My husband and I stayed in a corner suite for a total of four nights.The room was spacious and the view was amazing! I also loved the fact that the hotel did not have a casino and was non-smoking! It made for a much faster taxi line, especially when it was raining and no irritating cigarette/cigar smoke (I wear contacts so all of the smoke was really irritating my eyes).  . . Housekeeping was also very friendly and efficient when it came to cleaning our room. They were always on it when we needed something brought up. For instance, the Keurig in our room was missing and they brought one up for us as well as extra cups and k-cups. However, I did deduct a star because my things were constantly being moved. I.E. My hairbrush and facial lotion would constantly move from my side to that of my husband's. . . I also loved that room service was offered for 24 hours a day. We enjoyed ordering room service, but I despised the fact that it would take hours to fulfill an order. For instance, on Saturday night at about 2AM, we ordered two salads. We were told that it would take 30 minutes, but it ended up taking 2 hours. On Friday night, the same thing happened, however, this time, we had fallen asleep by the time that they delivered our food so we didn't get our food, but were still charged for the order. BOO! The other times that we did order room service, the food arrived within a reasonable time frame so room service was definitely hit or miss. . . I would still recommend the Vdara because it isn't as crowded as other hotels and it has easy access to the freeway.
I recently stayed at Vdara while visiting Vegas for a friends wedding weekend and I absolutely loved my stay here.. Vdara is a gorgeous hotel and I think one of the best things about it is that its a non smoking hotel and it doesn't have a casino. . Complimentary Valet Parking 24/7, no self parking but why would you want self parking when you could take advantage of the free valet parking.. I was able to check in at 11am and was upgraded to a 36th floor suite, sweet.. Room was extremely clean and I never had any issues during my stay. . The rooms are really spacious and with great views, no paper thin walls makes it a huge thing when you have the vegas late night drunks stumbling around.. If you're looking to gamble Aria, Bellagio and Cosmopolitan are just a few steps away. . Staff is top notch and very courteous. . The location is really good, just behind The Cosmopolitan but with easy access to the stip. . The hotel offers a nice bar "Bar Vdara" with a full bar and great food menu. Also they have a starbucks for the coffee lovers.. Pet friendly.. Free WiFi.. Really nice fitness center.
I stayed in the Vdara Suite over the weekend and had a great experience. This room is 811 sq ft with one bedroom, full bathroom, living room, full kitchen, dining area, washer/dryer, and a half bathroom. Everything was clean and modern. It felt like a nice little one bedroom apartment! The bed was super comfortable. The blinds were controlled by a button! Ooo fancy. On top of all that, it was a really good price at $229/night for a nonpeak weekend.. . Service exceeded my expectations. I had made a reservation online earlier with my AAA discount (10% off). When I checked in at the front desk, the guy told me that I was an Mlife member (I didn't know that) and told me that I could get an even better discount (15% off). He took the time to create my Mlife card and even changed the rate for my friend's room as well who didn't even check in yet. He was super friendly and gave us his opinion on Drais since we were planning on going that night. I think his name is Dominic? Also, all of our luggage arrived pretty quickly to our room. The bell boy asked if the fridge and everything was working and if we wanted him to get ice for us. . . The only con was that since Vdara is valet parking only, Sunday morning around checkout time was a bit hectic. There were so many people waiting outside to get their cars. We waited about 20 minutes.. . Tips. -No self parking but valet parking is free. -Dog friendly hotel. -There is a security guard that checks room keys by the elevator. -Free wi-fi for up to 4 devices (your last name + room number)
This was my first time visiting or staying at Vdara. Our stay was excellent- beginning with valet and extended throughout our stay. Vdara staff are amazing and really made us feel welcomed.  . . We were upgraded to a corner suite upon check-in and the room was absolutely amazing! Stunning views of the strip, Bellagio fountains and more. the room sas comfortable and had features such as a washer- dryer, full kitchen including dishwasher, stove and full sized fridge. The rooms were sleek and comfortable. We requested extra pillows and blankets from housekeeping which were delivered promptly.. . Valet, housekeeping, cafe and front of house staff were all superb. very friendly, welcoming and accommodating.. . The hotel just turned 5 years old but is very well maintained and clean.. . My only complaint is that the market closes at 10pm on week nights - but it is December (slow season).. . We will definitely be returning!
So I have to start by saying that the people make the place; the staff at Vdara are amazing.  Polite, helpful, and going above and beyond for no reason other than because they want to.  That kind of ethic always gets 5-stars from me.  It was my first time in Vegas (a city I learned I am not cut out for) and I did the gambling, spending that is common.  What was uncommon was having an establishment, NOT Vdara, overdraft my account by $1500.  As a result, the day I was to leave I had no cash, and obviously, no money in my account.  I was unable to get a cab to the airport... problematic.  After trying multiple ways to use other forms of payment, Ben, the man who calls the taxis for guests, calls one up and pays for my ride to the airport.  He said, "It's close enough to christmas, right?"  What a way to save the day!. That being said, the environment of Vdara cannot be beat.  The rooms have a simple elegance without all the fluff you find all over Las Vegas.  The suites are clean and spacious with wonderful views, the lobby and sitting areas are open and inviting.  Our suite had a washer and dryer in it!?  That was a first!  Also, it was QUIET.  After walking on the strip all day, it was a welcome change.  . . I will likely never go farther in Vegas than the airport ever again... But if I do, Vdara will be my first stop.
Vdara hotel is absolutely beautiful. The foyer doesn't have the smell of cigarettes nor the clinging and clanging of slot machines. It is an actual hotel only in the midst of Vegas. I appreciate Vdara for what it is and daring to take luxury to a new level by leaving the casino aspect to other hotels.. . It shares an entrance into Aria and Cosmopolitan. Follow the narrow paths that have an arrow pointing to Vdara. The rooms have a modern feel with wood coloring, kitchen and a King sized bed. There is a dining table, powder room, large bathroom with your shower, bathtub, and vanity area. These rooms are big enough for at least 5 people if you use the pull out couch. If you get a room high enough, you can see a great skyline view of the strip. . . Housekeeping services are EXTREMELY quick. They are probably the quickest at getting the extra towels, toothbrushes, and bed sheets than any other hotel that I have stayed at in Vegas. . . Vdara, I hope to be back soon!
I stayed at this hotel for 5 days for a conference, which was held in the hotel, last week. I would stay there again.. . ROOM:. My room was beautiful, and HUGE. I had an enormous (presumably king size) bed, and I heard the, yes, sofa in an adjoined "room" divided from the bed area by the TV floor-to-ceiling cabinet, and the desk. There was a kitchen area also, even with a cooktop, though I did not see any cookware, and, there was no grocery type store that i saw near the hotel. A Walgreen's that was supposedly nearby, but which took me hours to get to, going through the Cosmopolitan casino, which I heard took another fellow at the hotel, about the same amount of time to find. The room had free wifi, which was good. POOL: Its pool was closed for the week I was there, which I'd have appreciated knowing before I reserved a room there. There was also no sign at the pool area saying it was closed. I found this out while 2 other people were trying to get into the pool area as I was, by visiting the concierge who told me it was closed for the week. I let him know there was no sign there. I was able to use the pool area in its sister hotel Aria for the week, but that cut out on my lunch time taking 15-ish minutes to walk back and forth for my lunch hours at the conference, not great.. . CONCIERGE:. I was here while the bull riding championships were in town, which I have always wanted to see. So I asked the concierge if tickets were easy to get, and was told they were sold out and I'd need to go through a ticket broker and they were really expensive, which seems like an odd thing for a concierge to say to a hotel guest, versus getting the price for me and offering to get the tickets for me. Later, another guest told me there were plenty of tickets, and they were "cheap," so I am not sure what was true, and sadly to me, I didn't see this event I'd always wanted to go to for amusement. It always cracks me up watching it on TV.  ;). . FOOD:. The hotel has some food at the bar, and a deli type place where you can get decent and expensive breakfasts and other meals, and it also has plenty of takeout options. You are able to get any of their foods as take out. I saw an older gentleman in a suit at a table, receive his breakfast in a takeout box, saw him explain he was eating in (and he was seated at a table), and saw the server bring him a plate to transfer the food to from his takeout box. I was surprised seeing this given the cost of the entree, that they didn't take it back and plate it for him -- that seemed surprisingly shoddy. . . The quality of the food was fine, not particularly notable for the eggs Benedict. Its breakfast potatoes, while tasty, were not at all crisp, which I like to see in a breakfast potato. The takeout cobb salad was generous though, so that was good. The biscuits and gravy I'd skip, even though usually I love this dish. It featured sausage that was in casing, then cut up which was odd, so that got screwed up in the gravy, and the biscuits were unusual, soaking up the gravy instead of acting how biscuits in gravy normally "act". Not sure of the words to use, but that dish I cannot recommend, here. I did not have lunch or dinner here so cannot comment.. . There is a Starbucks in the lobby also, and had prices that were okay. I was in a Starbucks in a Hilton in San Diego a few days later, featuring prices about 25% higher, so the prices at the Vdara's Starbucks were decent, for Vegas.. . LOCATION:. Overall though, it's a very nice hotel. And, a BIG plus; they don't allow smoking here, because they don't have a casino!!  That is pretty huge. All other hotels feature casinos, and this one is adjacent to the Bellagio's casino so it's still closeby if you want to gamble. Their sister hotel, Aria, also has a bunch of other restaurants pretty close, across a giant valet circle drive, about a 5 minute walk away, but has a casino too. And Cosmopolitan hotel / casino is about a 6-7 minute walk away, going outside, down stairs or there's an elevator, and walking across its giant circular valet drive, but crossing some treacherous lanes of traffic also -- not friendly to do, but not really far, per se.. . Overall though, I liked the hotel very much. I'd stay there again. Trying to give an idea of its location conveniences. I don't know Vegas very well, so hopefully this is useful.
I decided after my finals this semester to do a staycation on the Strip because I've never stayed at a hotel on the Strip before. I chose Vdara because the price was relatively cheap compared to the other hotels and had what I wanted which was a large tub for me to soak in. Vdara is also smoke-free and without a casino, though Aria is in walking distance if you want either option. There is also free wifi for guests (included in resort fees). You just have to put in your last name and room number. It worked great when I was streaming Netflix.. . I had to look up how to get to Vdara because I had never been there before and the map and directions were on the website. Turn left on Harmon if you're coming in from the south then follow the signs to the hotel. It can get a little confusing, but I managed. Vdara only has valet parking, but it's complimentary and that's what I did with my car. From the valet to the front desk, everyone was very friendly and enthusiastic. The person at the front desk was efficient checking me in and asked if I wanted a room on a low floor or high floor. I wanted high for the view and got a room on the 50th floor.. . The room itself was huge and had a mini fridge as well as a kitchenette if I wanted to cook (I didn't, but always good to have). The window shades are controlled by a remote that is on the wall between the kitchen and the bedroom. The view? Amazing. My room was located where I could see the south end of the Strip.. . I had always wanted to order room service and decided this was the time to do it. I ordered Organic Airline Chicken and two sides: Mushroom and Herb Risotto and Sauteed Spinach. It took about half an hour to arrive and when it did, the person who brought it was friendly. She came into the room and placed my food on the table in the kitchen along with a flower vase. At first glance, I thought "Oh no, the chicken is smaller than the sides it came with!" However, I couldn't even finish my meal and had to save it for the next day. Both the spinach and risotto were delicious, no complaints, but the chicken, while crispy and yummy, was just a tad on the side of salty. Still good though.. . Bonus: As a Vdara guest, I was offered a 40% discount to watch the cirque de soleil show Ka. I've been wanting to watch a cirque de soleil show since forever because I've never been to one before, but I especially wanted to watch Ka. You bet your butt that I jumped on this deal and I was not disappointed.. . I loved everything about my room and this hotel, from the large tub to the people working here. There were two minor things that I didn't like, but didn't really detract from my experience. One was that, because I had a room on the higher floors, I had to take those super fast elevators that my ears did not appreciate whatsoever. Also on my second day, I had gone out to eat breakfast and lunch, but housekeeping never showed up in my room. That was fine. However, when I went to watch Ka at MGM Grand late in the afternoon and came back, I was disoriented because I couldn't turn on the lights (housekeeping had turned off the lights using the master switch which I didn't use) and everything was cleaned up. Including my makeup on the bathroom counter which got organized. I honestly didn't expect housekeeping to show up so late in the day and it wasn't a nice surprise because I wasn't expecting it.. . If I ever decide to do another staycation, Vdara is definitely a hotel reservation option. Love this place!
The hotel was really and the staff was friendly. However, I was not impressed with our first day service. When we pulled up, the valet area was filled with cars. we didn't even know where we should park our car. When the valet attendant pulled up, he was able to help us. The next day, I found out that the hotel did not have a casino. WTF? What hotel in Las Vegas does not have a casino? This kind of threw of my stay just a little. But being Aria Hotel just a walk by, I did not let it bother me much. . . The rooms were beautiful. I like the separate kitchen, living room space and bedroom. I really like the bathtub. Overall, this was a fun experience.
This is really a 3.5 but I rounded up because the staff is so friendly. Its hard to stay in a penthouse suite at the bellagio and then staying at any other penthouse suite and not let that influence my review. . . We stayed in the penthouse suite, it was about half the size of the bellagio's. Yes, I realize that the Vdara is about half the price of the Bellagio, but I digress. . . The hotel is new and clean. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The room is clean and modern. I love the fact that they have a full sized refrigerator for booze and left overs. The bed is relatively comfortable, the windows are really dirty. . . Overall, its really good for the price. If you are looking for a luxury hotel, stick with Bellagio or Wynn. I probably wouldn't stay again.
Awesome full suite rooms. It's worth paying for the lake view so you get a view of the Bellagio fountain. If you're going to use the kitchen make sure to request dishes and silverware and a coffee pot ahead of time. If you are going to use the pullout couch you also need to request bedding ahead of time. They are slow in fulfilling these requests once you check in. Also there is only valet parking, no self park. Normally it was alright but during checkout hours around 11 you might wait an hour to get your car. You can call down to the front desk and ask for late check out so you don't have to wait for your car for that long and they'll comply. All in all it was a nice stay.
Vdara is a gorgeous hotel and in all honesty, I loved our room, but two things really turned me off to it...so much that I don't think I'll be coming back. #1 Housekeeping never showed during our three day stay despite having had pressed the house keeping button. We paid the ridiculous resort fees for what now? No service and no clean anything. The front desk was busy when we called btw, so we didn't get through to complain. #2 The lack of self park services is just plain stupid. I kept my head screwed on straight through the first two 20 minute waits for valet to retrieve our car, but after checkout, we had to wait a whopping 45 minutes in the cold with our luggage. THAT IT RIDICULOUS. How does management see this on a daily basis and not address it? Either hire more valet guys or enable guests to park their cars. What a waste of our vacation time.
Loving this high class hotel! This is probably one of my favorite places to stay, and I think the Vdara has some of the most breathtaking views out of all the hotels in Vegas.  Our group of friends recently stayed in a suite, which had a queen size bed and pull out couch. We had awesome kitchen accommodations, including a water filter inside the refrigerator. Other basic kitchen amenities included microwave, stove, sink, refrigerator, freezer, and plenty of storage space for drinks and snacks. . . The major downside was the bathroom, which is a central part to getting ready for a night in Vegas. The features inside the bathroom were awesome, though. We had two sinks, a bathtub, standing shower, toilet, aaaaand a separate full mirror with plenty of counterspace for doing makeup, hair, and whatever else people do in front of a mirror. However, all of this is enclosed behind two doors, so technically, only one person can be in the bathroom at once if they are using the toilet, tub, or shower... unless your group members are super comfortable with each other. Plus, our sliding door was broken, so that was awkward.. . The bedroom has a plasma TV, which was useful for watching movies in the morning or bumping music at night. The hallways and walking spaces are a bit cramped in the suite, but if you don't have too many people moving around, it's not too big of a problem. Room service is good, and they are quick to bring us any additional amenities upon request. Overall I'm looking forward to staying at the Vdara again, and I would recommend it for other parties visiting Vegas!
Where do I start - at the end I guess - a huge disappointment every day new issues all of which are not acceptable.. . We called in the day before our arrival to ask for connecting rooms, the lady on the phone said she will note it but we should plan on checking in early...and so we did, we checked in at noon time - the lady in the front desk said the rooms need to be cleaned but that should not take long and they will call and let us know when they are ready - she even gave us the key cards...we waited 90 min's and made the 1st call to check in on the status - a different lady said it will actually take 2-3 more hours, (just a reminder the official check in time is 3 PM). she promised they will cal us when the rooms will be ready...so we waited again and at 5 PM we called and asked and the answer was - one room is almost ready and they are working on the 2nd one. So we waited and called again, (no one called us as they promised few times), by 7PM we just went in and got into our rooms as the call never came . . The rooms were just in really bad condition, everything was dusty and not cleaned - even though we waited all this time for them to be cleaned up and ready...i have the pictures...was really tough getting to sleep thinking about the germs surrounding us.. . On the 3rd day we left the hotel in the morning and when we came back to our room we realized the room door was left open by the cleaning team for hours...there goes personal security and privacy. . Not sure we are coming back...not with this level of service . . The Front Desk managers did try and make things better and showed understanding to our frustration but nonetheless it isn't fun complaining all the time
For this seasoned traveller - this place is the bomb!  What I love: no casino, large rooms, kitchen, suite service, lobby bar (crafted cocktails), Starbucks in lobby, Marketplace, no smoking, connected to everything awesome - Crystals shopping, Bellagio, Aria, Transportation, Concierge great!, and so on . . . 3 x's this year alone!  Can't wait for my next Vegas stay here.
We stayed in a panoramic suite for 5 days. The suite is upscale,  new and nice with the washer and dryer combo. The housekeeping service was very, very poor. We had to request plates, utensils,  towels, shampoos, every time. It was not automatic that they should replenish these items every day. I had to call them every single day. It was really inconvenient.  Each time you called, you will wait for 30 to 45 minutes. So for the shampoo or towel or even the bathrobe that they forgot to replenish, you call and wait. It was the worst housekeeping service I have experienced.
Unlike my stay in Aria perviously, I had a very pleasant stay in Vdara. This is a low profile hotel since there is no casino and many bars and restaurants but in exchange, it had very nice rooms. I had a view of the Bellagio's fountains too. . On top of that, reasonably priced. . There is not self parking but Valet is complimentary.
Since I travel a ton, giving a 5 star rating is bit of a big deal for me.  Vdara did not fail on any level and far exceeded expectations.  I was here for one night on Christmas with my parents we had a great experience from beginning to end.. . The rooms are beyond spacious (see my posted pictures).  We had a king bed + sofa bed.  The views were spectacular of the Strip.  The bathroom was enormous and the kitchenette upon walk in was also spacious enough for a short stay.  All amenities were ultra modern.  . . Housekeeping came up within 15 minutes of the request that was made for shower caps (FYI, they don't have these in the bathroom so you have to request it). I asked for complimentary water and she came back with 5 of them instead of just one...nice touch.. . Valet was a bit busy but I am blaming it on the holiday and it took about 15-20 minutes to retrieve our car.  . . Overall, a super clean, on-point service with modern touches type of hotel.  Exactly what I expect from each hotel experience but rarely get consistently. Bravo Vdara! I will definitely recommend away...
Absolutely stunning hotel! Beautiful lobby and bar. Valet staff quick and courteous. Front desk amazingly helpful. Our two bedroom suite was breathtaking! Very spacious with modern furniture. Quick walk to either Aria or Cosmopolitan if you want to gamble or convenient tram to bellagio. I actually left behind an item and contacted customer service/concierge who quickly located it and proceeded to immediately send it to me despite the busy holiday season. Look forward to staying there again soon!
