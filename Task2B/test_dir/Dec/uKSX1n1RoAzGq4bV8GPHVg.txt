What a wonderful restaurant!  The food is amazing: bold but balanced flavors in original, interesting and absolutely ecstatic combinations. The environment is comfortable and friendly, if a tiny bit hipster-ish, but ultimately a lovely place for dinner. 6 stars if I could give 'em!
Great alternative to eating at a resort while we were in town.  Has a cool urban vibe to it (even though it's on main road) and the food (all locally sourced apparently) was delicious.  Best part was the prices - great value (though we're from Boston so anything is cheap to us)!
Woww So Great this Food is at St Francis Restaurant. Yum...just writing this is making me want to go back right now. Hertz Car Sales Phoenixs' friend Brian O'Malley let us know how awesome the food is and he was absolutely right. Thanks so much Brian.. Your restaurant is crazy comfy with such good food....I'm heading over now. Happy Camper, John Fliss and the guys over at Hertz Car Sales Phoenix.
A nice trendy place to eat the sources everything local and fresh. If your looking for intimacy this is not the place as your conversation will be heard with the table next to you. It was very cramped with small portions for the money, but worth a try if you want something different.
Friend said he seen this place on t.v. and the reviews are great, so we drove out to Phoenix to try it out. The bar tenders are very friendly and the outdoor seating is very nice.. . Ordered:. . French Onion Burger - OMG the best burger I ever had, the taste, size, texture,  everything was amazing about it. #1 burger in my books. . . Pig Dip - It has a unique taste, like how you dip it in the broth to soften up the bread, but I wasnt wow about it. . . Must come to spot for the burger.
Great... The food is great. I ordered the scallops and it cooked perfectly. I normally afraid to order scallops b'c it is difficult to prepare and cook well. However, it was done well. I would recommend this place to others who love great food, warm atmosphere, good service.
I love the food here and the ambience. My only complaint is that there is no parking and only valet. They claim it's free but you have to carry cash if you want to tip them. And I rarely carry cash....
Great food and service. I had their Chorizo Scramble and it was very good. Just the right amount of heat with great flavor. Next time I'm trying the Eggs Benedict, it looked really good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

Oh, don't miss Apple Crumb Tart for dessert.
LOVED the food here, the service, the atmosphere.  And I'm picky.  We got to sit outside under the grapevines.  The cocktails are creative and refreshing.  The food is healthy and delicious. Our server was excellent.  I will go back the next time I'm in Phoenix.

Great restaurant, with fine cocktails and good ambiance.  I give it three stars because of their terrible parking situation, which is "complimentary" valet.  First of all, it's totally inconvenient because it adds an extra 5-10 mins to your visit as you have to hand off your keys when you get there and then wait around for them to fetch your car when you're ready to leave.  And valets are never truly complimentary, as tipping the valet is standard.  Get it together St. Francis!  This is Phoenix, not DC, NYC or Chicago.
Three of us had excellent meals at St. Francis. The goat cheese appetizer was a tasty starter. My pot roast was quite flavorful though a bit fatty. The salmon was a big hit and the Moroccan meatballs were good as well though you have to be prepared for Moroccan seasonings like cinnamon. The sticky toffee dessert was a good choice to share for the table.
Good food, friendly wait staff, causal atmosphere and great place to meet friends for lunch or dinner for a relaxing meal. If you are looking for an adventure into the best of wine from Arizona, you can get it there.
