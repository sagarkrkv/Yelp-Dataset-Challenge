Nowhere close to as good as it was before. Service was lacking even though we were in the diamond vip section. Not the treatment I expect in vegas. . . We shouldn't have to stack up plates because no one came to collect in a timely fashion. the hynas at the desert section have were curt and unfriendly.. . Food was not even great, only decent. Heated plates were inconsistent, leading to cold food. Simply not impressive.
They hubby and I stopped in at the Carnival World Buffet in the Rio while visiting Las Vegas since our first choice place was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday.  They did have a lot of variety of food to choose from, but we weren't really impressed with the food options itself.  Nothing really stood out except for their gelato bar and wine bar, which was in my opinion this buffet's saving grace.  If it weren't for that and the fact that our waiter (Andrew) was super attentive I would've given this place 2 stars.  We won't be back, especially with all the other great places you can try in Vegas.
This use to be my father's favorite back in the day.. . It is super expensive for no that great quality of food.. . Plus side our waitress was super nice and brought us all the drinks we needed.  . . Though I will not be returning.
What a dissapointed visit! Not anything like it once was. Had better food at truck stop. Way over priced for what you received. Go to other places in this casino, far better.
Worst buffet I have ever been to in Las Vegas. Absolutely a rip off  what chef? I see nothing worthy that is here warranting a good rating for a buffet. Waste of hard earned money. Management could care less if food bad.  Never ever would I recommend this place 100%
Decepcionante ! , primer punto dicen que es el mas grande del mundo y no es cierto ! El de xcaret Cancun es mucho mas grande , los platillos bastante regulares ! Nada del otro mundo .
The best day was amazing but the service was even better!  Pat kik incredible care of us so much so that we never had a dirty dish or an empty glass of the table for the hours we were there. The prime rib, many soups and noodles as well as a fresh salad bar were delicious but the desserts are incredible!
As a local, this has been one of my favorite buffets of all times.! It has definitely changed severely over the years, people come and go, I've had family work here & I can assure you it's a clean location, it's not that expensive. There is a variety of food choices, along with fruit, and desserts.! . . It's the perfect spot for a family reunion, or a date with your other half. I go whenever we get a chance to enjoy the Rio & the Carnival buffet. I have not been disappointed, great people seating and serving. I hate tables, love booths. So when I'm place at a table I just ask for a booth and their more then happy to move me.. . . Truth is, I love the Carnival Buffet
Best and largest buffet I've ever been to! Love how they have so many varieties and different cuisines. On a side note, it's quite expensive! But this is the best buffet in Vegas so can't wait to go there again.
Came here for lunch buffet because I had a 2 for 1 coupon. Paid $24 so that was good. The buffet was huge!  There's so much to choose from that you will leave wishing you could tried so many things but we're way to full lol. Roast beef was cooked and seasoned perfectly!  Only thing that could have been better was the dessert section. Not a really good variety of items there.
It almost pains me to give only 2 stars as I've got to be one of the easiest people on the planet to please - food wise. I had been here years ago, loved it, and was anxious to return. However, I just was not impressed with the the quality of the food. It just seemed to be lacking for some reason. The sushi seemed to be lacking in creativity besides not seeming fresh and the meats were too fatty.  The best item was the pizza; seriously? Luckily I was able to use a coupon and didn't pay full price or it would have been worse. The service was great, even though we had a fairly slow moving line to get in. Too many other choices in town to chance a return. Sorry.
Some things good. Some things great. Some things not so good.. . That's how it usually goes for most buffets. . This place is generally cheaper than other buffets in Vegas for dinner.. . It's about $30/person.. . If you come here on the weekends, do arrive early ! . Expect at least an hour wait for dinner time.. . They have a basic salad bar, crab legs, american food, mexican food, and mostly asian food.. . FOOD PROS:. 1. Roast Duck. 2. BBQ Pork. 3. Crispy Pork (Lechon). 4. Mussels & Clams. 5. Dim Sum. 6. Yakitori Sticks. 7. Prime Rib. 8. Roast Beef. 9. Large Asparagus Sticks. 10. Chocolate Fruit Cups. 11. Gelato Ice Cream. . . P.S. Service here is a hit or miss. We had waiters who completely ignored us or said someone would be at our table to help us and no one ever came. We didn't get our waters or drinks until after we started eating. So we had to flag down another waiter who was actually very professional and on top of his job.
I remember in elementary school I had a friend of mine who regaled me with wild stories of how excellent the buffet was at the Rio. Flash forward some 20 years later, and we're visiting a friend from Vegas who can't wait to take my girlfriend and I to this place. SURE! I sez.. . What I found was that the Rio buffet was like every other buffet I've ever been at in my life. There's a lot of food, but there's a lot of mediocre food. There's an Asian section that tastes like every take-out place you've ever had, with greasy duck, glaze-saturated pork, dry satay chicken skewers, and sushi with tough seaweed. There's a meat section with cut sirloin steak with absolutely inedible gristle adding annoyance, not flavor. There's a seafood station, which beyond the unlimited crab legs, is filled with fried foods, not fresh foods.. . A few positives: great pie, good ham, half-decent Chinese siu mai.. . We got in for about half the usual price ($16 as opposed to somewhere in the neighborhood of $32). Even at fire-sale prices, it still wasn't enough to get me to go back. Maybe this was a three-star place, but after hearing so many people in my life talk up the magic and wizardry of Vegas buffets, I was left especially disappointed.. . So, here's my advice: is a buffet a personal challenge to you to stuff your face with four plates of food, or do you want to just have a decent dinner? I'm the second kind of person, so next time I'd recommend to do as I do, and put that $30 towards one of the many, many, many exceptional restaurants on the strip that are competing on the basis of quality, not quantity. And guess what? You'll still get a filling, delicious meal!
Excellent buffet with different cuisine bars. Everything was good and refilled time to time. Loved the Chinese and italian the most. Fine selection of desserts.
This buffet does not have same selections and choices as the Bacchanal buffet, but otherwise the food quality is just a tad below Bacchanal. I particularly liked their soup station which featured 7 or 8 different choices ranging from Pho, Chinese, Japanese Udon to Thai. They were quite good and authentic. The sushi selections were standard, nothing exotic or special. Chinese options were tasty. Did not try their Mexican dishes. Naan breads from the Mediterranean section were light and delicious.
