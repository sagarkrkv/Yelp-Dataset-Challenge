Their chicken salad sandwich on cranberry pecan bread is to die for! I was in heaven the whole time eating it and got sad as it came to an end. The flavors of the chicken salad and the bread were a perfect combo. Both savory with a tint of sweet. It also came with a light salad which I loved as well. For $15, I'd say it's a steal for vegas and very generous portions! I'm totally going back for more next time!
I stay at the MGM all the time and find myself coming back to Wolfgang because even if the food isn't amazing for the price, it's still good and nearby.. . The tuna tartar appetizer is really fresh and delicious. I also got the Italian sausage pizza, which is a bit salty and heavy but still good. Couldn't eat more than 2 slices. The fettuccine pasta, surprisingly, isn't a cream sauce, but it's still yummy and the pasta is extremely chewy. It wasn't heavy at all and it had a nice veggie ratio.The burger. So delicious and the cole slaw was extremely generous. The fries weren't amazing but they did the job of making me pick at them over and over. The chicken entree wasn't too great either-I've had better mashed potatoes, but the chicken was so soft and tender that it tasted almost like salmon and it was cooked masterfully.. . Best of all? The service. We had to change some things around on our bill since we were separating between rooms but the server was extremely nice about it, even when he had to get the manager involved. Thewaiters made sure my water was always filled to the brim and they got us new bread quickly every time we asked for it.. . Will be back, as always.
So upset. I've been getting the truffled maytag blue cheese potato chips consistently for the last 3 months. Tonight was the worst. Last week I ordered 2 and the chips were burnt and the sauce was so watery. Today I ordered one and the chips are in 2 small boxes burnt and there is no maytag blue cheese at all. YES THERE WAS NO BLUE CHEESE WHICH IS A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE DISH AND A PART OF THE NAME!   Out of the last 11 times in the last 3 months my opinion is I got screwed the last 2 times. Now I have to tell everyone I've preached this dish and establishment to not to go because the quality is not what it used to be.  The Pic Below Is What I Used To get. Not no more! But I do need to state that the employees and service are way above par. That has not changed.
Food and service was excellent. Tuna tartar with avacodo is my favorite!  in the casino feel is nice but extremely noisy...expecially with some rodeo thing going on.  We couldn't hear each other speak. Would definitely go here again but when it's less crowded.
Great, interesting food. Great service. My daughter had lasagne - excellent. I had Chinese salad - it was very gingery/mustardy. For me it was great!
The menu is a bit limited, but the staff did a great job modifying items. The staff is a big reason I gave them a 4. They rocked it with courtesy, professionalism am efficiency. Timely on everything. The only reason I gave them a 4 instead of 5 was because of their gluten free pizza. The crust was worse than cardboard. No fault of the staff, but it is what it is. The crust was horrible. . . Here's a tip Wolfgang  Puck chefs...research "My Bread" pizza crust. It's phenomenal. If you can't find it, call Kaleidoscope Pizza in Medford, Oregon and ask them. The return on your GF pizza will be well worth it financially.
I tried this restaurant when I went to visit my family in town for NFR. It was so good we went for lunch AND dinner. We just walked right in - there wasn't a wait, and there were plenty of tables. The drinks were expertly crafted. They have the BEST hurricane I've ever tasted. So smooth, so good. My aunt got the Raspberry lemon drop... three raspberry lemon drops, actually. The staff was beyond wonderful and even went out of their way to chat about the NFR showing on the TVs. The chicken noodle soup was the closest I've found to my mother's homemade, and the salmon I had for dinner was divine. It's a huge slab, so it was good for two meals. My aunt had a fantastic spicy shrimp dish and my uncle got a tender, juicy steak. For dessert, the creme brulee was heavenly. There wasn't a bad thing I tasted and the service was impeccable. I have absolutely nothing negative about it.
Food was very good and great service. Abit pricey but the flavors in the meal are worth it.
We came here twice and the first night was decent but the second night was awful.  Our food seemed like it was microwaved. The service was good, and that's why the got 2 stars instead if one. I suggest you try somewhere else if you have money you'd like to burn.
My boyfriend and I were staying at the MGM  and decided to come here for lunch. The food was amazing!! We got the truffled potato chips, fried calamari, and shared a pizza. However, it was some of the worst service I've ever had. Our waitress was too busy talking to her coworkers to take our order... If it was busy I would understand but it was 3pm on a Sunday and not busy at all. There was a lot of people walking around not really doing anything. We waited about 10 minutes and were about to walk out when she finally came over to our table. After finishing our appetizers and waiting for our pizza she never came over to refill our drinks or check on us. She was however about 10 feet away from us chatting and laughing with the hostess. We had to ask a busboy to refill our drinks. And my boyfriend had to ask twice for his water refill. Service was overall disappointing but if you want a good meal you won't be disappointed with the food.
Unfortunately the qualities gone down through the years. This used to be my go to place every time i visited vegas, but not anymore. I used to get their prime burger when they had it, but I don't think they have it anymore. So on this current visit, i ordered their regular burger, medium rare and it came out well done. This used to never happen, but on the last few trips, it's become a frequent occurrence. My friend ordered fettuccine shrimp scampi, and the fettuccine was undercooked. Still a decent restaurant, but now, the prices don't justify the quality imo.
Shrimp fettuccine & lasagne are incredible! Our waiter was very helpful & even told us about a Lychee drink they used to make,  and they were able to make it for us even though it was no longer on the menu! Yummm... I frequently stay at MGM signature & will definitely go back to this restaurant. No too pricey considering it's a Wokfgang Puck restaurant.
I would recommend the rigatoni with fennel sausage. Delicious! Don't waste your $10 on the house green salad (unless you enjoy a plate of a variety of lettuce) bland! Also, the fettuccine with shrimp is pretty good. Light and shrimp is great quality.
Went there last week for dinner. Boyfriend had spaghetti and meatballs and I had fettuccine with shrimp. They served bread. Food was good but nothing over the top. Service was good. He had a beer and had a glass of wine. No dessert. $100 bill. Seemed like a lot for pasta.
Me and my friend went for dinner. Seemed casual. We only waited five minutes to be seated, so that was nice. . . We were hungry and wanted everything!! We ended up getting the Mac and Cheese to start off. It was rich and creamy. They also brought us a selection of breads. We were a little full and our food hadn't even come out yet. . . The food came out and it looked amazing. My potatoes were a little salty or maybe I'm not used to it cooked like that, but it was still good. My steak was cooked just how I like it and green beans were perfect!! My friend got the chicken and she said it was ok, nothing special. She also said her mashed potatoes were a little salty as well. . . Overall good service and good food.
Food was delicious. Price great. I will be visiting here again on my next trip to Vegas.
The grilled shrimp fra diavola with polenta is the perfect small meal and there Wolfgang chardonnay is delicious.
