Nothing but class at the Wynn & Encore. Boutique shops, excellent dining options, wonderful gambling options to fabulous view from all windows. . . I've seen all the shows at the Wynn and you can't go wrong with any of them.
I'll give the 'five star hotel' three stars. The sole Reason is that the shower head only drizzled a sparse amount of water upon my arrival. I suspected that similar to California, Las Vegas, might be facing a severe drought. Therefore, I thought the Encore hotel took measures to dissuade hotel guests from using too much water.  But, honestly, the very limited water pressure and paltry amount of water that trickled out of the shower became unbearable. After three miserable showers, I finally alerted management and they had engineering replace the entire shower head! Instead of apologizing, they asked why I didn't call sooner. Further, the staff person explained that they were 'surprised that earlier guests hadn't complained'! For a five star establishment, I would have appreciated far better treatment for the inconvenience.  Once the shower head was replaced, the shower was in great working order.
Wynn has to be one of the nicest if not the nicest place in Vegas to stay at.. I have been here twice and everything from the customer to cleanliness of this place is on point. There is a reason why this hotel is more pricey than that of others. You get what you pay for. Wynn cares about the upkeeping and cleanliness of their resort and it shows. Everything from the rose pedals being swithced out daily to the carpet having that brand new smell. The pool is also heated during the winter time. The fitness facility has a lot different equipments. The spa is world class. I tried to pick out something wrong with this place, and I couldn't find anything. Highly recommend.
Disappointing; overly crowded and pedestrian despite nice setting. When we came, lines for checkin and taxis were endless. Baggage service took nearly an hour. Pool was closed for maintenance with no head's up or warning from staff. By 230 pm room was still unmade, but a bottle of water from the minibar had been replaced. WiFi even for guests is $15.99/day. Gym not free for guests either, with its own charges. Valet was attitude-y. During the night pipes creaked and groaned and thin walls left us hearing music and talking in other rooms. Would not return here.
Loved this hotel! The rooms were spacious, great room service. The hotel has great clubs, restaurants, great pool, and a great casino. Loved the decorations!
I stayed at Wynn for two nights and it is gorgeous, comfortable, and nice place, but I will not stay there again because I could not sleep until 4:00am since their night club XS were so loud even though I was at 35th floor.  . The concierge did not seem to care about my concern.  They said, yes some people complain about the nightclub noise and we are aware of it.  I don't think they care since they will make more money until 4am?. It's unfortunate because hotel is very beautiful.  I won't recommend this place  to others due to the reason I have mentioned above. . . .
Being at the WYNN is a TRUE WIN! This place is amazing as expected. From the great design outside, to the great customer service and looks on the inside. Nothing can go wrong here. The waterfalls and the foliage here make this place amazing and they do such a great job on upkeep. . The customer service here is fantastic as well as the drink service. If you are gambling, once you order your comped drink, you don't have to wait an hour to get it like other casinos. It was there within a couple minutes. They place customer service first and it shows!
I LOVE, LOVE the Wynn/Encore! . . I don't think I can ever stay at any other place in Las Vegas after spending a week here. As far as the hotel itself, the accommodations they have for their guest is amazing! Customer service was on it too.. . My family, friends and I had a little trouble checking in and after a little miscommunication they accommodated us with an upgrade from a standard room to a suite at the Encore Tower. Originally we had reserved for a 3 day/2night stay but extended our stay for the rest of the week (with no hassle/problem at all).. . Our suite was top of the line - our view overlooked  XS and the venues pool and further along parts of The Strip. Last but not least, the ambience and interior design was luxurious - from the set up of the bedroom and living room. In addition to that, they have mirrors all around the entire suite which we have benefited from so much during our stay (majority of us were girls so everyone had their space and we were almost always on time when it came to getting ready for our day/night of events). . . As their guest, we were a very big group and we didn't have a problem when it came to having a place or spot to get our beauty sleep - beds are very large and comfortable, and their couch was also a pull out bed. They provided extra pillows and blankets in their closets. Never hesitate on calling the front desk/room service - they were so generous when we requested for an extra pull out bed, a refrigerator and extra pillows & blankets.. . Last but not least - ENCORE BEACH CLUB (EBC) and XS Night Swim (Summer experience). How can you say no to that?! It was such a great convenience to us just to take the elevator down and straight to the venue, (NO RUSH, NO LINE, NO COMMUTE). On top of that, Major Lazer was spinning the weekend I was there and Skrillex currently has residency on Monday's at XS. WIth a plug here and there (it's not very hard to find one in Vegas), my party and I were able to get free bottle service during our stay. The amount a typical person would spend on a room + having to get a taxi, Uber or Lyft to a hotel/venue would be the same amount you would spend here with the luxury of staying at the Wynn/Encore. . . Trust - I can go on about this place.. . All in all, you won't regret your stay here. :)
I'm very impressed by everything in this hotel, very nice and warm welcome feel , Great restaurants , Great casino.
Is there such a thing as "too classy?". . If so, the WYNN not only crossed that line, but it built a solid-gold-barricade to keep out the huddled masses yearning to take a peek at the lobby while having the audacity not to purchase a single thing. . . The least these would-be gawkers can do is pop into one ofthe WYNN's eateries and order a unique snack, like unicorn flanks or an omelet made from the last remaining Dodo eggs. . . Maybe a souvenir is more their speed. In which case, patrons are welcome to visit the WYNN's very own Ferrari Dealership. What's that you say? Only Sheiks and former Latin American Dictators can afford such a vehicle?  Fair enough. . . Maybe you should just relax in the WYNN's spa, where you can experience the world's most unique treatments. Rumor has it that, if you know just how to approach their masseurs, they'll arrange for a clone of the late Liz Taylor to give you a scalp massage using only her feet.. . If, for some reason, you find yourself in the presence of Steve WYNN himself, be sure to take in his sweet, one-of-a-kind natural scent, which only blooms at night. But be warned: DO NOT look him directly in the eye, as he perceives such actions as a threat.  If he begins to pound his chest or pull up grass, stand your ground but look down as a sign of deference. . . All in all, it's a pretty classy place.
We had our wedding at the Wynn and it went perfectly! The hotel is amazing nice. The rooms are beautiful and have amazing views. We stayed in the panoramic king room for two nights, and for our last two night we stayed in the salon suite. Everything about this place radiates opulence. From the amazing floral displays, to the chic shopping experience. The restaurants are all high class and delicious. We had an unforgettable time
We went here for my friends birthday and everything tasted good, lots of vegas style deserts
My family have been loyal customers of Wynn for many many years. It's been our favorite hotel until today.. . The customer service at wynn lacks professionalism. I was thoroughly disappointed at how a manager handles a mistake that was made by an employee checking us in. Upon check in, my card was double charged for the resort fee. The next day when I approached the checkin desk again to voice my concern, the manager I spoke to was extremely arrogant  and insisted they corrected the mistake so that's all. His apology was insincere and he communicated with a stern face and acted like I was wasting his time, when it was his staffs mistake that's causing me extra trouble.. . I've stayed at plenty 5 star resorts and not once have I experienced such horrible customer service.
Fancy place, decent price range.. Downsides:. Internet is not free and expensive.. Security were unreasonable and mean. . Slow staff.
First time staying at this hotel and I am blown away at how gorgeous it is! Have a basic king size room and it is amazing! Very clean and spacious. Love the furniture and the decor of the room. View is spectacular! Don't think you can get a bad view in this hotel. This hotel is in a great location right across fashion mall so lots of shopping and restaurants to choose from. Kind of got lost trying to find my way to my room so I asked an employee nearby and they were very nice and helpful in pointing me in the right direction. Will probably stay here my next trip back.
The best and only hotel I stay when I go Vegas , the room just make me feel like I'm at my own place and make me feel so relax .......I love Wynn ^_^
After reading a lot of articles about the best buffet in Las Vegas, I've decided to take my parents and brother's family to your well written and advertised buffet. $50 per head for a party of 6 on what was supposed to be a special Holiday dinner should be worth it. Never mind that we waited 2 hrs in line standing up, this should be worth it. That's what we kept telling ourselves. . . It was not worth any of it. . . Aside from the very long 2 hours wait, the food were not even remotely special. The food was cold, the fish (sea bass and salmon) were over cooked, the oyster Rockefeller kept running out, the creme brulee was kept covered and only given when you ask for it, the crab legs were too salty, the pasta was dry, the meat have been sitting sliced and cold on the board...I kept trying to try a little of everything (did I mention very little selection?) just to give justice to this experience, but I kept getting disappointed. My family were disappointed. We didn't even find anything special about this dinner experience. . . Our server and the desserts were okay. That's the silver lining. But really, the overall verdict - Christmas Eve dinner Fail.  . . I am very disappointed in this dinner experience which was definitely not worth our time and money.. . Is it possible to get a refund? Or turn back the time so I can choose a different place to take my family? Probably not.
I came to the Wynn specifically to enjoy SW Steakhouse. I pulled up to the complimentary valet. They work solely on tips. I went to the restaurant and enjoyed one of the best meals of my life for a little under two hours (see my SW Steakhouse review for the delectable details!). The valet was an extremely convenient option versus self parking and walking some distance. The restaurant is really close to the valet entrance.. . After dinner, I hit the casino floor in hopes of recuperating some of the $300 I had just spent on my meal. I told myself I was going to gamble $100 only, which usually turns out to be a disastrous attempt at self control (one word: ATM).. . Wynn boasts the latest in slots, video poker, roulette, and table games (blackjack, pai gow, etc). There is a wide selection of games, and friendly staff. Getting a player card is a breeze, and I've never had a machine malfunction on me. Overall a great place to play slots and video poker. Don't forget to indulge in some free drinks while you're playing; just remember to tip your cocktail server.. . I put $100 into a roulette machine. I like a system of betting 2 of the 3 grouped number fields, i.e. 1st 12, 2nd 12, or 3rd 12. This way you have a 2/3 chance of winning one unit on every spin. For example bet $20 on 1st 12 and $20 on 2nd 12. If you win, you win $20. If you lose, you lose $40. I've gone on a winning streak of $800 before at the Wynn using this system, betting in $20 increments. That means I won a total of 40 units. Be cognizant of the 0 and 00. These put you at slightly less than 2/3 odds to win. Tonight's session didn't work out so well. After numerous bets, I was down to $60 and decided to cut my losses. I moved on to my favorite casino video poker machine - 100 play draw poker.. . *Do not gamble. Gambling typically results in loss of money. (Author assumes no responsibility for anyone ignoring this advice.). . On previous visits I have noticed about four different 100 play draw poker machines at the Wynn. I saw one and immediately sat down. They're usually pretty popular so I was surprised I found an open one right away. I was only betting $5 per hand in order to try to stick to my $100 limit. So with my remaining $60 I began my 100 play draw poker adventure.. . I was getting dealt crap and was down to $15. On the next, magical hand, I was dealt four 8's. So my $15 jumped up to $260. I started with $100 in the roulette machine, and left the draw poker machine with $250. $150 profit. I was a happy camper and got the hell outta there. In essence, my $300 SW Steakhouse meal only cost me $150! That's a win in my book!. . After having 3 kids, both my desire and resources to gamble have dwindled. I was super happy to replenish $150 and leave. I turned in my valet ticket, and my car resurfaced 5 minutes later. I tipped the driver and was on my way.. . As of 12/24/14, only three restaurants in the U.S. offer certified, authentic Kobe beef. Wynn has two of the three (SW Steakhouse and Mizumi).. . I've seen Le Reve at the Wynn and it's a beautiful, skillful show. It's almost as good as any cirque du soleil production.. . For a man who is virtually blind, Steve Wynn has precise, creative vision when it comes to the hotel and gaming industry. His properties are some of the best in the world. I highly respect the man and trust any resort with his name on it.. . I've stayed at the Wynn several times before and have always enjoyed myself. The rooms are clean and elegant. My parents have a long standing history with Wynn resorts. This relationship goes back to the Bellagio, Treasure Island, and the Mirage. We must've stayed at the Mirage at least ten or eleven times in the 90s. When Steve Wynn opened up his namesake hotel, my family came here and have enjoyed it ever since. Wynn Las Vegas is classy, professional, and top flight. I highly recommend this or Encore for a stay in Las Vegas.
This hotel is outstanding. At check in, we said we had a recent anniversary (which was in May but what the heck, May isn't THAT far from December is it?) and they upgraded us to a panoramic suite on floor 31 at no additional charge. The room is outstanding - automated lights and motorized window coverings and a view of the strip that can't be beat. WIFI is included when you are staying there because it is part of the non-optional resort fee, but even if you don't use any of the other resort features, it is pretty much a wash for what you would pay for the WIFI anyhow. Included with our stay was a free buffet for you. Usually buffets kinda suck, but the Wynn has the best buffet on the strip so well worth the visit (although the line was exceptionally long when we were there). The room was clean, the hotel was immaculate, and the staff was outstanding. If you want to stay in Vegas and you want a place to remember, stay at the Wynn (and go see La Rev).
I was comped here for a weekend and made full usage bringing the boys with me.  Saw some fights, lost some money but all in all a great time as always on the strip.  . . There's nothing I can add to these reviews really, high end facilities and located north center of the strip.  . . It's one off my bucket list to stay and play a round here as well.  We had a suite over looking wynn's 18 holes and I dreamt of the day where I could afford to play a round and stay at the wynn on a single trip.  Now that would make me feel all grown up.  Great hotel.
Whenever we go to Las Vegas, we stay at the Wynn or its sister, Encore hotel. I'm totally taken to a new destination when I enter these doors. Truly, It's like Hannah in Wonderland, but everything is a beautiful experience. The best show, The Dream, is a must see for all. It's AMAZING. It amazes your entire being. Just sit back and tune everything out... and for a few hours, you're just totally engaged and tickled deeply.. . The interiors EVERYWHERE, are so exquisitely beautiful. No matter what you wear and who you are doesn't matter. The staff here are very kind and respectful. I love even looking at the casinos, the beautiful walls, and the LIGHT FIXTURES of all shapes and sizes and settings. ALL different, yet they're linked, in that they provide a nice mood that's easy on the eyes.. . The butterfly is the trademark it seems. Oh and the lovely lit white peacock is so stunning. Every dining restaurant is unique and decorated to fit a certain mood. It's truly a very well thought out structure. The pool is so spacious, and they give you towels too. There's someone there to help you, and provide whatever you need. . . They even have cars for sale too! It's truly a nifty place to walk into. You can just take a nice walk within this large site, and be taken away into your own private imagination. The colors are so mixed with perfection. My eyes will take its time to really look at the details. I don't want to be with anyone else to talk about what I see... it's just for me. I love that... I feel it on my own... unsullied. PURE TO MY BONE.
I love this hotel, but I think the Bellagio still wins in my book. . My family and I got upgraded to the 60th floor, which had an amazing view. The rooms are SO cute and clean and there's a TV in the bathroom... lol! However, the TV in the room didn't work at all, despite the "directions" on how to use the TV on the remote control.  . Also, the walls were SO THIN! I could hear people talking in the hallway all throughout the night, plus I could hear the neighbors during the middle of the night (although this might be because they were fighting...). . Anyhoo, I'm a fan of the hotel itself, La Rev the show, the buffet (for brunch and dinner), and the shops.
This is our second time we stayed at Wynn Las Vegas. The first time was only for two nights in April 2014 and this past week for 5 days.. . The first time we came here and introduced our daughter to "R&R", it was a toss up from Palm Springs (which we had done a few times already) or a NEW desert experience. I had wanted to keep her innocent mind and eyes from all this but, dad ensured me she would have a blast (in my mind, I still recalled many times mom and dad had to smuggle us kids in...).. . On to the hotel:. Never once during the past stay did we ever feel as if our daughter ("does not drink, gamble or eat enough") was not appreciated. All the staff treated us as if we were royalty. One exception was when we were standing BY the ATM machine and a staff member escorted us away from it due to my daughters age. My daughter said (at 8 mind you) "what am I going to do? Take the ATM and go gamble with it?! I'm not even old enough better yet strong enough to do such a silly thing!" So to staff, we understand some of the rules and how closely you are watched but really?. . The buffet (as mentioned) is SPECTACULAR!The food is amazing as is the spread and the separate dessert room?! Absolutely worth the amount you pay but NOT worth breakfast, lunch and dinner worth.. . The pool staff, my deepest appreciation to them. They treated my daughter like she was Queen of the Pool. Everything was "yes miss, no miss, how or what can I get/do for you miss".. . Wynn, received a call from me the very day we got home and I thanked them up and down for treating her like a person regardless of what she spent. This place knows, treat the kids well and mommy and dad are more than happy to come back.. . And come back we did! This time for Christmas!!! This time we stayed for 5 days and to tell you that this was an even better experience even with all the traffic of world travelers, you would doubt but I'm being honest here.. . At first, we booked our room at Encore (requested Strip view) but when we checked in, we were staring straight at the airport, a BIT of the golf course and the back of Wynn. Encore just lacked what the Wynn has, activity and view. We immediately called the front desk and they moved us to the Wynn with the best view we have ever had.. . They sent us a "Hotel Porter" who carried all our belongings to the Wynn. We tipped him very well as he did everything for us. Got us a fridge and a "roll away" bed.. . The view was beautiful from our 58th floor. We can see all the way down the Strip which is what our daughter loves most.. . This stay was different, we went down every morning to the drugstore cafe to get apple juice, coffee and muffins. Therefore, quite a few dealers and security got to know us by face and greeted us every morning as our now 9 year old walks out sporting her Christmas Jammie's and carrying her teddy. Cutest part was when security bid a morning greeting to our daughter and her teddy.. . Only once (again) were we approached by a large woman security asking my daughter to don her shoes when half of the patrons visiting from other hotels were barefoot in the lobby with a lame excise of "there MAY be glass on the floors front he ornaments or loose tile...". I guess she is looking out for a future client but seriously? Ok, whatever.. . This time however, we passed on the extreme long lines for buffet but we did try the Terrace Cafe. Excellent food but slow service. Totally worth it if you don't have plans to tour the town.. . This time, we stretched our wings in Vegas. We went to:. . Bellagio - O. Neon Sign Museum. Mob Museum. Paris - cafe at Eiffel Tower. Lotus of Siam. Fogo de Chao. Ramen Sora. Circus Circus - 9 year old gambling at the arcade. Luxor- Titanic exhibition. Battlefield Las Vegas. Hard Rock Hotel. . This was the one of the best vacations for all of us as we got to see much of Vegas...through different lenses.. . Wynn staff, thank you again....for treating us so amazingly on our second trip! Especially our daughter. See you next year!
Great pool, beautiful hotel. Love the bar next to the water with shows at night. The room was great! The beds and pillows were great!
an over the top beauty...every detail down to the uniforms match everything else.. . best deal is to use the AMEX PLAT and get into the tower suites which include free breakfast, valet parking and $100 SPA credit....make sure you have a strip view, then you can view the lakeside show from your room.. . if you don't go tower, then ask for a corner suite on the north side facing the strip.  the room is about the same size as the suite BUT it has an INCREDIBLE view of the entire strip!!!. . If your looking for a beer guzzling Vegas experience stay in Downtown or the south side of the strip...this is a big boy place and they want to keep it that way.
Maybe my expectations were too high because I was honestly a little disappointed in the Wynn.. . We checked in late on a Friday and maybe the woman that helped us was tired or something because she was not very friendly. I asked for a room on a high floor - we got the 8th floor - so that didn't work.. . The room itself was nice but like I said I guess I was expecting more. It was just very ordinary, like a room you expect to find anywhere. I thought with the Wynn I would get a "wow" factor but I didn't. The window shades are controlled by a remote panel which is fun for the first few minutes but that's about it. . . The bed was very comfortable though so I'll give them that.. . I also did like the pool area quite a bit. It's large with lots of great places to lay out. We went later in the day so it was pretty quiet. I'm not into the pool party scene so I liked that it was more laid back. I think the Encore is where the party is at if that's your thing.. . The other downside to the Wynn is that it's on the end of the strip so it's just that much more walking to get to the action.. . Next time we're in Vegas I think we'll stay a little more center to the action, like Bellagio.
