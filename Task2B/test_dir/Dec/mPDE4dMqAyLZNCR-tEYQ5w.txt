I'm trying to figure out how most folks gave this show anything more than 3 stars...and I'll tell you why.. . We went Thxgiving holiday weekend (busy time for Vegas). We sat in the right section mid way up (A tad too close). If you go to watch this, you'd be better off sitting further back in themid section, probably cheaper tickets too and I would only go if you can buy cheap tickets.. . This show would be a FLOP without the moving stages and sets built into the side of the auditorium. The storyline and performances or lack thereof would not be able to sustain itself without the amazing stages. The moving stage is the highlight of every scene with the performers incorporating themselves into it to give the illusion of moving landscapes, etc. The last battle scene and maybe 1 or 2 other scenes using the moving stage are the best.. . The entire performance is lacking with imbalanced energy levels from the entire cast. Some performers are extending themselves giving great performances, not spectacular however, whilst others seem to be going through the motions; it was palatable. Either the performers are bored with the choreography or the show in its entirety. There is one main evil character who looks like a cross between a Kiss rock band member and a Japanese warrior, he barely did acrobatics and wasn't in a lot of scenes but when he was on stage, he was captivating...he had stage presence. There was a baton twirler...yeah, a baton twirler who was ok but not anything special that I haven't seen a 16 yr old girl do during a street parade.. . I'm still trying to figure out how the "Spongebob Squarepants" scene with people dressed in beach animal character outfits was Cirque du Soleil'ish, they hardly did any acrobatics or feats of the imagination. It was more of a Tom n' Jerry comedy skit...I'm guessing they needed to burn time somehow to prep next scenes but I'm still puzzled by how cheesy this was executed given the opportunity to showcase their "talented artists." Another scene which was "visually" captivating for about a whole 3 minutes but lasted 10 minutes way too long was a rope hoisted performer controlled bird contraption where they dragged a screaming main character around (not doing anything acrobatic in nature) the entire front of the stage...bawwwwring!. . At the end of the show, whilst performers were taking a final bow...many of the performers started undressing right there on stage, taking off masks and clothing. Really?!? ...geez, talking about spoiling a supposed illusion filled performance with undressing performers during audience applause; how unprofessional!!. . For what the tickets cost, I don't recommend going to this show if you can't get tickets under $75 pp. It is expensive and not nearly worth the $150+ per tix cost that is charged on most sites. Not a lot of acrobatics that I hear most other Cirque shows are known for and I think that's due to the limitation of the size of the moving stage.
Amazing acts. Looks challenging but I can never do those lol. Specially when they do acrobats or whatever they do on horizontal and vertical surfaces. You have to go see this one.
We had pretty good seats...6 row from the front and right side of the stage. I don't think there was a bad seat in the house. The stage performers went through the audience... The show not only took place at the front stage but also on the side and above you. This performance had a story line compared to others that have multiple stories. This show is at the MGM
What can I say?  Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.  And I saw the show WITHOUT the infamous battle sequence -- although I hear they are bringing it back.  I can't imagine that it can actually get better?  I was really moved, and this is coming from a former (and jaded) New Yorker who has seen lots of shows.  Such a lavish production.  The visuals, athleticism, and powerful soundtrack have to be seen and heard to be believed.  . . I saw this and two other Cirque shows in Vegas: Beatles LOVE, which is also outstanding, and Michael Jackson One.  I would see Ka and Beatles LOVE (and I wasn't even a Beatles fan) over and over again. Although I thought the last 25 minutes or so of MJ One was really great, it didn't quite feel as Cirque-ish as the other two, and I wasn't as moved... not until the end.  . . But KA?  A masterpiece.  I didn't want it to end.  Not bored for even a second.
This show begins as a story about a boy and a girl and there are lots of asian fighting scenes, but then it reverts to typical Cirque acrobatics that leave you asking "What do these things have in common?"  They try to please everybody and fail.  Some of the stunts toward the end were totally amazing--the people climbing the vertical wall and sliding down, the flying butterflies all lit up, but most of this was boring and I wanted to sleep except the audio in your seat back prevents this.  Don't overspend for your seat--any one will do just fine.  Go see Beatles LOVE for a real entertaining experience.
The show was amazing. There's people to guide you to your seats and ypu watch the amazing show. Nothing to complain about. Oh yeah they're caramel popcorn in the snack section was yummy. They have a concession stand and sells alcohol slushy.. which I would've drank if I was adrinker. 2 sizes of draft beer.. 12 oz. And 32 oz. I just remember soda was a lot cheaper than bottled water. Lol
Favorite-est Cirque show I've seen. It's pretty much got everything - fireworks, rotating stage, acrobatics, and a cohesive story to go along. I recommend seeing this twice - once from the back so you can catch all of the stuff that's happening on stage and another time up front so you can see all of the actors' expressions and details you'd have missed.
It's more like a musical than a circus show. . If you expect more action then this is probably not the right one for you.. . I really enjoyed the music.. The moving stage is just fantastic.. The whole story line... Will require a little bit imagination and self explanation for it to make sense.. . The final scene fireworks was a blast.. . Overall, 5-stars if it was a musical.. Three stars just for the ordinary circus movements.
The show was excellent---story was scripted well and the acrobatics was fantastic. The set and props were quality. Everything was well choreographed. Definitely better than Mystere. Would highly recommend to friends.
I'd never been to any cirque de soleil performance before, so I was excited for this. At first I groaned over having seats all the way in the back, but you're able to see everything perfectly! The set looks like midgar from ffvii. The ushers looked like if Tim Burton had directed Harry Potter.. . It was a great show. The set with it's rotating platform moved in all directions, which mechanically was impressive. It was an easy story to follow.. . If only I had infinite money, because the style of the show influenced really great clothing available at the gift shop.
I saw Ka last night at the 9:30 pm show and I was amazed! The seats we got were row gg seats 21 and 22 for about $250. These are not the most expensive seats available so I was worried about not being able to see well. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized they were actually pretty decent! I had no trouble seeing the stage and did not miss any of the action. So save yourself some money and opt for the cheaper tickets! . . This was my first Cirque show and I really enjoyed it. It was full of action and had some cute comedy parts. The only thing I have to complain about is the storyline is a little hard to follow deeper into the show. The ending also felt a tad rushed but the finale kinda made up for it! The visuals and moving platforms are absolutely amazing!. . Definitely don't regret picking Ka as my first Cirque show. It was worth the money.
Seeing this show and knowing how Cirque du Soleil puts so much effort and $135 million dollars on this production makes this show more thrilling. My family and I stayed at Luxor and decided we would go to a Cirque show. Then we saw Ka and it looked like a really good show. So we bought tickets and waited for the 9:30 show.. . WOW! When I went into the Ka theatre, I can feel the excitement in the atmosphere. I felt right into the scene because the lights were dimmed, these cultural themed posts and bridges connecting all of them. And every time I go to a Cirque du Soleil show, I can't but help to anticipate. . Here's the cool thing. On your seat, there's a speaker built into it so you feel like into the scene. Plus, they have a giant stage that can rotate almost 360 degrees. The actors take precaution and have ropes that pull them up and down during the performances. The do this fluidly and you won't even know it's a part of the show. . . The death wheel scene was amazing. The actor jump-roped on it without any rope attacked to him so if he falls, it's the dirt nap for him. I just love everything in this show, from how the actors express emotions very realistically, to how the actors can see and perform with all that makeup on.. Overall, I love this show. I would recommend it for people who love exciting shows, action and you know what I mean. FIVE STARS!
Located in the back of MGM. One of the longest running cirques. Not open everyday. Two times on open days. Tickets are on the pricy side due to the stunts and risky acrobats found in a traditional cirque de soleil. One can find deals at the discount ticket booths around Las Vegas. . . This show arrangement runs similar to others offering a picture for payment before entering theatre. Staff help direct you to the seats fairly quickly. They even seat you during the middle of the show. It's incredibly distracting from the shows entirety.. . The show has an elaborate stage which is synced to the story. Lots of acrobatics and choreographed show. Few mini stories and a main story which are easy to follow.. . Good; large theatre, story, and stunt work. . Bad: the seating after show had started. . . Distracting post start seating could be helped be seating in empty sections take away from a relatively good show. Three.
One of my favorite shows next to La Reve and Mystere.  This very unique Japan themed Cirque features and amazing moving stage at the MGM.  The war scene with the arrows kept me on the edge of the seat.  Also a must see Vegas show IMO.
