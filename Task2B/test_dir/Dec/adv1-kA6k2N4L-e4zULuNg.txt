I Sony play tourist often, but every once in a while you just need to do it and this is the place.. . Seedy at times, plenty of sights and sounds to take in, it can be overwhelming. . . It's a free experience and there are plenty of food, drink and entertainment options to enjoy. No two visits are the same, so just go with the flow and do it tourist style.
Fur jemanden wie mich, der permanent nah am Wasser gebaut hat, ein wahrer Alptraum ;) Auf der Fremont Street muss ich standig vollig andachtig und ergriffen heulen.. Das liegt zum einen am Charme des alten Las Vegas, an den zum Strip vergleichsweise moderaten Preisen, an der gigantischen LED-Decke, an der Zip-Line, an der man sich unter eben dieser abseilen kann, an den Buhnen mit Live-Musik... besonders gerne wird hier Classic Rock aus den 80ern gespielt und Rockfans kommen bei all den guten Bands voll auf ihre Kosten. . Auf besagter LED-Decke werden stundlich Konzertausschnitte von Queen, Bon Jovi, den Beatles etc. gespielt, dazu fahren die namhaften Casinos, wie das Binion's, das Golden Nugget, Four Queens etc. ihre Beleuchtung auf "zero", so dass man die Show in vollen Zugen genieen kann.. auch aktuelles Tagesgeschehen wird schon mal an der Decke in Szene gesetzt. So konnten wir 2012 miterleben, wie am Todestag von Neil Armstrong alle Besucher der Fremont Street feierlich ihrem Helden gedachten. Wenn dann durch die lange Strae hallt ""That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind" und alle das Wasser in den Augen stehen haben, dann mochte man mitweinen.. Insgesamt ist die Fremont Street chilliger als der Strip. Ein Besuch an Halloween lohnt sich, hier trifft sich die freakige Gemeinde, man wei gar nicht, wo man zuerst hinsehen soll.. . PS: unbedingt den Pool im Golden Nugget besuchen!!!
It's worth a visit. ONE visit, at least.. . A lot of activity here, which is nice. That alone makes it worth the visit. Bands playing, scantily-clad women dancing. Too bad they looked so bored.. . Zip lines are available (expensive) if you like that sort of thing.. . We ate at two places here - the "gourmet hot dog" shop and the "middle eastern food" restaurant. Both were disappointing. Not terrible, but neither do I have a desire to return to those establishments. (What kind of middle eastern restaurant serves cheeseburgers?)
If you want to see old school Vegas, this is the place to be.
Awesome experience! Literally was only Vegas experience that I actually got CHILL BUMPS while filming canopy light show, which was actually a compilation of the coolest video graphics mixed with a Bon Jovi concert! Space ships zooming over our heads & humans zip-lining at 30+ mph over our heads way up! New casino, "The D", is very young, sexy & modern! Coolest people in pedestrian mall. Street Entertainers, too! I was there years ago & it's EVEN BETTER NOW! There is no cost to be there! If you miss this, you've missed Vegas! It's a part that MUST be visited to say you've been to Las Vegas!
I wish we would have spent more time on fremont street when we came to Vegas.  I felt a lot more comfortable here then on the strip.  Its an interesting mix of street performers, historical sites, and new technology.  Its a little seedy, but the strip has a little seedy too.  We took public transportation there and while cheaper, it took forever.  We took a cab back and it was a much more enjoyable experience.  . . I liked the vibe of the restaurants and bars here.  Everything is more affordable.  Things are less opulent and less clean, but a lot more comfortable.  I like the throw back vibe to everything, it felt like stepping back in time.  Nobody here takes themselves too seriously as it is Vegas after all.  I really liked the restaurants and bar here, there are some very nice restaurants, but again cheaper then the strip and with a more historical ambiance.  The video screen is very cool too!
I love the Fremont Street experience! If you can't have fun at this place, you're probably dead inside. You see EVERYTHING! Things you don't want to see & things you do, I'll let you find that out for yourself. Overall, if you're like me, love vegas and don't care for playing the machines $$$, then the Fremont Street experience is for you. Enjoying.
Recommendation: Come here after the sunset - you are here to check out the LED canopy light show.. . Not that much interesting food selections unless you are here for fried Twinkies or Oreo at Mermaid's Casino. The SlotZilla zip line is another reason to come here - just imagine soaring through a couple blocks of the street via zip line.. . Other pros: Live music and various street performances.. . Downside: Casinos are pretty run-down and it is located in the shadier part of Las Vegas.. . The Fremont Street Experience is not the main reason why you should come to Vegas, but I see this as a great complement to the Strip. A solid 3.5-stars and still worth at least one visit.. . P.S. - Some casinos here offer 10x odds on Craps tables.
Its a great place to people watch i say that for sure, the people trying to make a dollar are something else, but what makes me mad.as a Vet myself I think is horraible that there are WWII vets out on the street begging for money, I am sure they are on disabilty and get money every month like myself, for god sake have a little self respect, for what you been through.
I could go on forever about this place but its really just something you need to experience yourself. Forget looking at all the pics & reading the reviews. Just pack up & go. If you love people watching, casinos, cheap drinks, great entertainment & walking around outside then go!  Doesn't matter what night of the week it is you will have fun. I wish every city had a Freemont St. Experience.
Do your self a solid and skip the Strip. This is far more affordable, fun and unique. I love it.
How exciting.  I took my friend girl pal down here for her birthday.  I was saying o.k. we can eat, drink laugh and she can play at the tables.  I am killing all the birds at once.  I enjoyed the entertainment. It was similar to the entertainment on Venice Beach, in California.  At night it gets real funky. They have a large stage where a DJ cuts up on the 1's and 2's.  Everyone like we are in the 60's/  Fun Fun Fun.
