Holy crap, holy crap, holy crap!!!! . I had no idea what I was getting into when I bought the tickets. It sounded more interesting than any other show in Vegas and more entertaining and it was!  . No matter where your seats are you feel as if you're in the middle if the action. If your in the front row be careful, you will get picked on and if you get out if your seat you're in danger of being hit by the action. . . I don'tthink I've laughed so hard in a long time. It helps that I'm a fan of dirty humor. I would advise that if you're sensitive or have no sense of humor then save your money and see a family friendly show.
My wife and I really enjoyed this show. We highly recommend it.. . It is hard to come up with a comment that has not already been made by other posts. It is all true.. . If you are easily offended - stay away.. . If you can take raunchy humour - then come to this show and be prepared to laugh till your sides hurt.. . The experience of watching these strength, agility and aerial acts up close like this is extraordinary. The muscular men and shapely woman performers are very easy on the eyes ... . . The burlesque parts of the show was tastefully done.. . The seemingly adlibbed humor of the host was very sharp witted.
This is hands down my favorite show in Vegas! So rude, lewd, and at times partially nude!. . If you're a lame person that is easily offended. You should probably stick to seeing the Mormons, Donny & Marie across the street.. . If you aren't lame go see it!
LOVE THIS SHOW!  Every time we go to Vegas, we see this show.  It's that good!!!!  They change it up a bit, so it's different every time. Plus it's just hilarious.  You need to see this show!!!  BUT!. . As others have remarked--this is not a show for people who do not enjoy explicit or lewd humor.  For example:  If you don't think jokes about Republicans, dirty sanchez's and ejaculating unicorn penises are funny, you're not going to enjoy the humor portions of this show.
I went to see this last night, and thought it was awesome!  Paid for the VIP tix, came with a small bottle of champagne.  We were in the 3rd row, and had awesome seats.. . I loved this show.  From the acrobatics, to the dance, to the "ring leader" and his assistant Penny.. . I knew going in exactly what I was getting into.  Racy/crude jokes, underdressed acrobats, uncomfortable chairs, etc.. . That being said, I would go back in a heartbeat.  Next time I would just pay for VIP seating, without the champagne.  Small venue, so all seats are great.. . I can't add any more than all the other reviewers.  If you get a chance to see it, go.  It's hard to pick a favorite act, as all of them were immensely talented.... But if I had to choose, the tap dancers were AMAZING.
I've seen this show twice, which is two more times than I've seen most shows in Vegas. I come to town to be a degenerate gambler and I don't usually take breaks. However, I really enjoyed all aspects of the performance.. . Absinthe has a great combination of acrobatics, stand-up comedy, showgirls, and very very off-color humor. Some of the acts changed between viewings, so it remained entertaining. . . I enjoyed the intentionally offensive humor, but your grandmother might not. So, bring folks you can look in the eye after your run-of-the-mill sex joke.
So far the best show I have seen! The show is very raunchy,sexual, funny and entertaining! I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who wants to laugh and be entertained.  There is a lot of profanity and sexual suggestions, but all pretty funny!Only bad thing may be the seating, it isn't the most comfortable and the seats are very close to each other.
LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX. . Oh my goodness.. Don't come to this show if you have any sort of delicate sensibility.  It's not for the faint of heart.. The definition of raunch and irreverence, the Gazillionaire, vulgar master of ceremonies, takes aim at gays, lesbians, whites, blacks, Asians, Republicans; no one is safe.  If you're sitting in the front or anywhere near it, beware that you may be the butt of his jokes as well as be called up on stage to do some things that you may not want to in front of anyone much less a  crowd of strangers.. There's cursing up the yin yang and so much talk about sex that I think I even learned some new things.. While the sleazy Gazillionaire is hilarious, it's his assistant, Penny Pibbets, who stole the show for me. The ad-libbing is lightning quick and she'll leave you laughing so hard that your abs will hurt. . Oh, and there are aerial artists, a high wire act, a lady singer, and an electrifying tap dance duo among other things in this show. "Absinthe" is like that famous French-Canadian circus troupe's black sheep cousin. As other reviews have stated, the seating is tight, so go with someone you really like because you'll be THIS close to each other.     Once seated, you're not going anywhere because everyone in your row will have to stand up to let you out AND you may be called out by the Gazillionaire or Penny for disrupting their schtick - beware!. I don't know much about ticket prices because the BFF took me, but I'd definitely pay to see it again--it's worth it for the unique entertainment you'll receive.  . Come see this twisted vaudeville circus for 90 minutes of outrageous hilarity and hi-jinks, but leave your sensitivity at home.
This show was awesome! Hilariously funny and entertaining. I enjoyed the side kick Penny, she kept us laughing the entire show. This show is a mix of cool tricks and sexual jokes, it's fast paced and we were always either in awe or laughing. However, my only gripe is the seating, the regular seats are fold out chairs, not that bad unless you're sitting next to a heavy set person (which we were). The seating is a tight squeeze, we were very uncomfortable, no personal space between people. Next time I would pay extra for the back seats that seemed to have more room. Overall a great show with terrible seating.
The best show in Vegas. Eye opening, surprising and engaging. Anything goes here - the Zillionaire has no verbal boundaries. That said, if you are easily offended, I suggest you go else where. Absinthe is like the rebellious cousin of Cirque de Soleil. Zillionaire is a Cirque alum (I think Penny is, too?) and they decided to do something more fun, more raw, and well, they probably treat their staff better than Cirque does! . . If you're a goth/punk/indie/not a person who likes the usual fair in life/art/music this is the Las Vegas show you must see. There isn't a bad seat in the house - we got our tickets at the Tix4Tonight booth across the street (mid level price). The seats are close to one another and uncomfortable for some people (all the older people who sat near us were whining about their butts hurting, ha!). You can pre-game outside of the tent and people watch. Inside, they serve splits of sparkling wine with plastic champagne glasses and other cocktails. . . Note: if you sit in the front row you will most likely get called out by the Zillionaire, and perhaps even participate in some type of...activity, with him and Penny.
Currently my favorite show in Vegas. I am a big fan of Cirque du Soleil, but this show made be realize how pretentious and pompous Cirque shows are and how kinda scream "we are art!" at you. Absinthe is a very vulgar and humorous take on that. I can imagine sensitive people being offended, but those would be the type of people who get offended at everything. This show is great. Lots of humor, cirque level skills and very modern. . . The seating is very intimate and very ghetto feeling. You sit in very cheap metal folding chairs which look like they were grabbed from everywhere they could find one for free. Its very cramps and you are very close to the stage. The stage itself is very small and Im amazed how much stuff they do on that stage. Because of the seating arrangement it sometimes is very difficult to see the bottom of the stage (especially if you are short).. . After seeing many Cirque shows, I find this show extremely refreshing. They even have a hilarious act that is an obvious spoof on Cirque du Soleil. I find their transitions much better the Cirque shows as they often have some clowns come on stage to provide somewhat limited humor. The transitions in Absinthe are great and very enjoyable. You are so close to the act that you can see things very clearly as well as the danger.. . Go see this show. You wont be disappointed. I cant wait to see it again.
This is tied for the best show in Vegas in my book. Was funny and also amazing. Small venue, so no matter where you sit, you seem to get a good view. There was an obnoxious drunk girl in the crowd that wouldn't shut up. The main guy actually made fun of her so bad, he had us all dying laughing before security got to her.
Please note this review is about a month old because I thought I had already wrote it.. . I had no idea what to do for my birthday so a friend of mine got me tickets to see absinthe and wow BEST BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER! I laughed, I cried from laughing, and I had a great time. This is one of the best shows I have ever seen in Vegas. Penny Pibbets and the Gazillionaire keep up the Vegas spirit of dirty talk and jokes and then the acrobat performers show off what they've got. The music was amazing I regret not buying the soundtrack while I was there. If you're going to see a show in Vegas please don't waste your money on a boring classic cirque du solei go check this show out I promise it will be worth every penny spent.. . My only complaint would be the seating, we had seats in the 4th row and it hurt my neck from having to look up, if you do buy your seats make sure they are more towards the back. I'm also claustrophobic but luckily I had enough bubble space but it is pretty crowded.
Fun fun fun! A little something for everyone. If you're easily offended by vulgar language and swearing, this isn't for you. Fantastic acrobatics and dancing and humor! This show has it all. Highly recommended!!!
By far the best show in Vegas. . Aim for the seats in the back with the tables, you'll have a bit more space.
When I saw that the show was to take place in a tent, I really didn't know what to expect.  Was it going to be like the horse show Cavalia?  It turns out the inside of the tent was set up like a saloon and very intimate.  The spacing was rather tight and we sat in wooden chairs that were literally right next to each other.. . There were a lot of fun acrobatics: people standing on chairs, throwing each other in the air, running around inside a ball, riding a unicycle on thin rope, it was all really cool.  There was a burlesque singer who jumped in water and even 2 tap dancers.  There was also raunchy jokes (very raunchy jokes) and some audience participation in the form of lap dancing.  It's also inspiring to see how much teamwork is required in acrobatics and how much trust you have to have in your partner.  . . I liked how the show was somehow connected, but not really, and there was a lot of variety, so there was never a dull moment.  If you like to laugh, aren't too uptight, especially about sexuality, then you will have an amazing time.  However, if you are uptight, you may get a little offended.  Also, the director likes to pick on minorities, so if you are not a white male or female, be prepared for possible ridicule or forced participation.
By far the best show for my money on the strip.  Have seen this show 4 times and the latest was its best rendition so far.  I have recommended this show to many people  and taken a few people to it and they all say it was a show they'll never forget.  If you want to see a Vegas show, see this one.. . If you are thinking of seeing Zumanity, see this first. Baudy with lots of Sh** and Fu** humor as well as very detailed human anatomy and ethnic jokes along with half naked incredible bodies, you must be open- minded to see this show.  But this is Vegas.  This is what you came here for!  If you don't have a good sense of humor, please stay away.  Don't ruin it for others.. . If you get VIP seats, you must be prepared to be a part of the show which can include being mocked or used as part of the show.  Only good natured people should get VIP seats, but they are a must!! With a VIP ticket you also get a glass of free champagne or water when you enter through the phone booth.  Everything happens on or above a 10 foot diameter hydraulic stage and you can even see the sweat on their faces.. . The latest rendition includes the classic chair stack, Caesarian comedy duet, the tight roper frat pack, the female (lesbian) trapeze duet, the quartet of acrobats from Ukraine, the balloon act, and the gorgeous Melody Sweets as the Green Fairy.. . New performances included twins, Sean and John, the tap dancers.  Amazing!  They got a great ovation from the crowd.  Another new act was Lea Hinz, a beautiful brunette, and her aerial hoop routine. My gal had to hold my jaw from dropping.. . Back from the first time I watched are the German roller skating duo and the Polish bodyguard musclemen.  These are two of the stronger and unique performances that I was happy to see back in the show.  Penny Pibbets, the Gazillionaire's sidekick, has her own new show and has been replaced by Joy who was hilarious with some good new jokes as well as some of Penny's classics.  The Gazillionaire was great as always as your foul mouthed and inappropriate host.. . I was told Ming and Alexa the duo from the air strap acrobatics were on vacation. Another act that might have been on vacation was the high wet rope Russian female acrobat that the Gazillionaire calls the "Most Beautiful Woman in the World".  Both are very beautiful performances.. . Last, one of the most underrated aspects of the show is the incredible mix of rock, club and indie music pieces from the show - whether it is Meyer Hawthorne, Joan as Police Woman, Calvin Harris, or Muse.  If you heard something and want to know what it is, just let me know and I will tell you.
Its vulgar and f**ing vulgar.  Once you get past that, its hilarious and a pretty quality show.  I watched Vegas Nocturne and loved the intimacy of it.  I was so excited to see the mothership.  When we got there, the show ended up starting late.  That wasn't a big deal but we got placed in a seat in the back near the side stage.   It was the worst location!  We couldn't see anything past the 6 foot linebacker in front of us.  Next time, we won't pay for the cheap seats.  Luckily, we were able to switch seats since it was a lighter night.  But after that, it was a great variety show experience!
So first off, this show is not for those easily offended. That said, it is hilarious and totally worth the money. I have seen many shows in Vegas but this is by far the best. There is a great mix of raunchy comedy, graceful acrobatics, and cirque type experiences. There isn't a bad seat in the tent, and despite the fact you are a little crammed in and forced to sit on folding chairs, you quickly forget about these minor issues as soon as the show starts. They have done a great job with pacing and I must say I haven't laughed that hard in a show in a long time.
Absinthe is probably my favorite show in Vegas ever! And I've seen several of the cirque shows (including O, Michael Jackson One, Zumanity, Criss Angel), Le Reve, and others. Absinthe was able to combine several elements of raunchy literal LOL comedy, impromptu jokes, audience participation, and jaw dropping acrobatics and entertainment. Yes, the jokes are lewd and at times, grotesque, but c'mon life is way too short to take yourself too seriously. Have a drink, sit back, and enjoy the show. Seriously, I had to catch myself from laughing too loud because I didn't want to irritate the people I was sitting next to. It was that funny. . . The tent is super cozy and intimate and the decor complements the circus type feel perfectly. . . So next time you're in Vegas, do yourself a favor: check in to get$20 off your ticket and go see this show!
The show was awesome.  The setting is very small but this just adds to the the show.  You are able to see how hard the acrobats are working.   This is very evident with how much they are sweating and muscles trembling.   The comedy portion is hilarious but can get pretty raunchy and politically incorrect so don't go if you get offended.   There is also the chance you may be the target of some of the jokes. It is also very sexually suggestive but no full nudity,  they do go down to pasties.
Very funny-poked fun of one and all. Good performances on stage. The ringmaster was hilarious, as was his sidekick Penny. I would recommend to anyone looking to laugh, but be aware-the tickets are pricey!
Five star entertainment......funny, raunchy, breathtaking, exciting, brilliant...worth every penny to be be dazzled by brilliance for 90 minutes...GO SEE THIS SHOW...that is all
I have been to "The dream", "Totem" and this one only. I would say there's a lot of concepts/acrobatics common in all these cirque de soleil performances but Absinthe by far was the funniest such performance. Except for 2 performances (lady with the ballon and the singer) the rest were awesome. The clown was also hilarious although he was picking on the audience randomly with his rated comments. Overall very good, but wish it was a bit more that 90 mins.
This show its worth the money and time its freaking awesome . If you like vegas style show you need to check this one out for sure you going to love it
Best show that I have seen in Vegas. Combination of comedy,acrobatics and singing. Definitely recommend watching this.
