We ate at this restaurant on 12/29. There were six of us, had reservations at 5:30, so far, so good. The waiter came to the table and was just not professional. It was like he thought we were friends. Salads and soups came and went, still good. When the entrees came out, they brought them three at a time 5 minutes apart. I had the short rib with potatoes and brussel sprouts. The sprouts were cold, the short rib and potatoes were warm. I asked if anyone else's food was cold or warm, and the answer was a resounding yes by someone who had the chicken. We called it to the waiters attention. He apologized quickly and took it back to "take care of it". The food came back 10 minutes later with a plate that was so hot it was ridiculous, but the food was still warm on both of the returned entrees. I elected not to make a big deal out of it and ate what I could. Another of our diners did point it out to him unbeknownst to me, and he tried to "make it right with 2 complimentary desserts. At the prices they charge for these meals, this is just unacceptable. I am writing this to partially vent and to warn future diners to beware.
It was OK. Very loud and the food was decent but not worth the hype.
My boyfriend and I wanted to grab a quick glass of wine around 4:30pm last night. Unfortunately Picasso's was closed, so we walked back to Olives because we wanted to be able to watch the fountain as we sat.. . We were told that the seating in the bar was open, but the restaurant wasn't open yet. Except every seat at the bar was full. We asked if we could grab a two top table just across from the bar - just to have a place to sit. . . I can't even explain the response we got - and how much of an inconvenience our simple request was. We were told that the bartender wouldn't serve us there, so I offered to order and pay at the bar but still wanted to sit.. . We have been staying at the Vdara and have been treated with nothing but respect and gratitude. The run around we got from the staff at Olives and the rude attitudes we received was completely unacceptable. The way that we were treated was so unacceptable - especially for a place that was empty except for the bar seating. They clearly do not care about customer service. We walked straight to the Vdara and received exceptional customer service. I highly recommend avoiding this place if you want to have a good dining experience.
My boyfriend surprised me with a night of romance.  He called told me to put on that pretty dress that one he likes oh so well. I knew just the one he was referring.  He asked me to meet him at the bar by our "dorm". When I Arrived He Was inside Had My Beer Waiting, We Had A Drink And Then Off We Went. Not having a idea of where to next. As we drove down towards the strip, my heart was racing I knew it would be a great surprise.  We started with a appetizer at my favorite spot, walked over to olives, where at my table were the prettiest flowers I had ever laid eye's on. The night became magical with him ordering a drink just the way he knew I would like, dinner was amazing.  Our server was great, I apologize I forget his name, but he was very helpful.as we watched the water show, he told me how lucky he was to have met me. For the first time I heard the 3 words we all desperately hope for. I love you.  The night couldn't of gone any better, but it did. He then took me listen to the piano player, it was there we had our first dance.
Hmmm. Why did our waiter have zero fine dining experience? He actually bussed our plates while stacking them in front of us on the table and grabbed the end of my cesar salad salad wegde (located on the bottom plate) and threw it on top of the stack of plates so he could carry them. He then marked for next course before we were done with the first and forgot forks which is sort of important if you want to eat. Food was decent.
If I had to describe this experience in one word it would be "WOW".. Chilean Sea Bass, out of this world, but what made me extremely pleased was Chris our waiter. Personable, attentive and on point.  Olive's welcomed me not as a visitor to it's city, but as a guest that was as though I was a regular. Recognized as someone that deserves the best treatment every time.  I look forward to coming back, and thanking the Chef personally for a 5 star meal.
We were celebrating out 33rd Anniversary! The meal was outstanding including a special dessert.  The best part of the evening was our server Paul Anthony!   We lucked out when we sat in his section!    Paul was awesome his persona says "I'm happy I like my job and I truly love people".   His attention to our needs and the details were just great!   We were able to observe how he handled other tables around us and it was wonderful Paul made every table feel special!. Thank you Paul, You made our evening  special.
We dined at Olives last night a party of 6 and I was expecting a great meal. Food service was really slow and the food was marginal at best. I ordered the sirloin steak med rare it came well done. It was replaced and cooked better the second time but still was not very good - funky preparation.. Too many good place in Vegas to eat, this is not one of them!
The restaurant is located in the Via Bellagio Shops across from Tiffany & Co and next to Louis Vuitton. If you're lucky enough to get outdoor seating, you will have a fantastic view of the backside of the Bellagio fountains if it's during the show. Since it often gets busy here, I recommend getting reservations. There are no restrooms inside the restaurant, but there is one located next to Tiffany & Co.. .

Loved the complimentary spreads that came with bread basket. For an appetizer, we had ordered the Beef Carpaccio which was everyone's favorite as it was very fresh.. . My BF had the Fig & Prosciutto Flatbread and thought it unique and very yummy. Crust had the oven brick baked taste to it. I had the Ricotta Ravioli. I was afraid there would be sun-dried tomatoes but the waiter was nice enough to verify with the chef whether or not there was any in the dish. Very bold flavors, I really enjoyed the dish. Our friends thoroughly enjoyed their dishes as well.. . Since nearly everyone was still hungover, we all opted for a cup of coffee to end the meal. It was on the weak side :(. . Service was very attentive. Plates were quickly cleared and glasses/cups were constantly refilled. Napkins were also folded when someone stepped away from the table.
Great food and terrific service. Our waiter was friendly and gave great recommendations on drinks and food. We were both pleased with our entire experience. But the real reason this place deserves five stars is the view. The patio is worth the wait and we were memorized by the water shows. The Bellagio fountains make this restaurant memorable and a must visit next time you're in Vegas.
My husband and I made last minute reservations here for dinner after a show on Saturday night and we are so glad we did. The restaurant was busy when we arrived at 9pm, but we were sat right away. This restaurant offers beautiful views of the Bellagio fountain, so it was nice to watch the show go off every 15 mins or so.. . Our waitress was accommodating and friendly, and took the time to go through things on the menu we weren't quite sure about. We ordered the Tuscan Farmhouse flatbread, it had shaved ham, mozzarella, asparagus and caramelized onion. It was very good, the bread had a nice consistency, doughy but crisp. My husband ordered the special, spaghetti and meatballs in a cream sauce. He said it was good, but the cream sauce lacked in flavor. I ordered the beef tenderloin, it came as a perfect medium. It had a nice crust to it, and was like butter when cut. The mashed potatoes were nice, as well as the tempura asparagus. We also chose to get the zucchini sticks, and so glad we did. They were seriously one of the tastiest things I ate our whole trip. . . The service here was amazing, and super attentive. Drinks were topped off frequently, and I'm pretty sure it would be impossible to finish a water without someone refilling it. Food was served quickly as well, we spent less than an hour here, but never once felt rushed. We will definitely return here when we come back to Vegas !
The only reason I gave this restaurant 2 stars is for the Beef Carpaccio. I moved 2500 miles earlier this year and my sister and I did our annual Vegas trip right before. I had  been searching for the best beef carpaccio in the city and supposedly, Olives had it. . . When we stopped by we found out after inquiring that restaurant hadn't opened yet. When we expressed interest in dining when it did open, no one informed us that there were no reservations and standing in line would be the best thing to insure a patio table (we had made it clear we were hungry and desired to sit outside by the fountains to see the show). Therefore, when we came back, there was a very long line. I wasn't happy and neither was my sister. When I went to speak to the front of house team, they didn't seem at all concerned that they had dropped the ball. I would say that my casual clothing put them off, but first, that shouldn't make a difference. Second, if they are going to do that, they should have been able to discern that although I was dressed casually, I was wearing about $10k in clothing, my clutch, shoes and jewelry. . . So we are put onto the patio and things just went downhill from there. Although there were available tables in front right next to the water, we were given the "bad" table, the one right by the server station. The table next to us asked why if there were no reservations why they weren't sat up in the front and were given a BS answer (that the tables were reserved). Considering that they were a nicely dressed young couple, you have to wonder who you have be to be given a good table here. We were ignored for quite a while, even after placing our menus closed in front of us. Once our server did show, he treated us like kids at Christmas who snuck over to the adults' table a year before being called up. I dine at places like this or better on a consistent basis. My choice of casual wear on a long weekend with my sister doesn't change my speech, manners or decorum. None of the high end stores we shopped in while waiting for them to open had an issue with the way we were dressed. If we weren't so hungry, we would have left. I treat everyone no matter what their capacity with dignity and respect. However, being spoken to like we didn't belong by our server was rather disconcerting. . . Our food finally arrived and I don't recall what my sister ordered (I'll have to ask her), but I recall that she said it was ok. My beef carpaccio was outstanding. Which makes the experience that much more disappointing. . . Midway through our meal, the other tables that were empty started to fill. It was clear that the servers knew a table of elderly people that they placed next to the water. My sister and I had never been there before and after this experience, most likely never will again. Before anyone says that they must of had a reservation, it states on the Bellagio website they don't take reservations for the patio (in fact, when we came back, she again informed me that they don't take reservations).. . We wanted dessert, but frankly I wasn't about to spend another dollar in a place that had gone out of its way to treat us the way they had. I shouldn't have to walk around flashing my boyfriend's black card or have him make a call for people to treat us well. It wasn't a birthday, anniversary, etc. we were celebrating, but my sister and I weren't going to see one another for a long time and this was time spent together before my move. We didn't allow it to ruin the rest of our day because we aren't like that, but given that it's a restaurant in the Bellagio, if you can't get even acceptable service here, where can you? My birthday is next month and we are doing our 2015 trip then. I am considering staying at the Bellagio. But the way we were treated at one of its restaurant gives me multiple reasons  to rethink that.
Older lady waitress tried to up sell me, but overall provided decent service. The views are super fun over looking the Bellagio water show, and they provided heaters outside on a cool day. My fiance and I ordered the Olivers burger and a Caesar salad to share, and both were definitely worthy, however, the quality did not match the price, but would recommend for the ambiance!
The food are sooo delicious :D
Love it. I made reservations for my wedding anniversary and birthday. The service was excellent. The lollipop pork chops were delicious but the ratatouille and couscous was bland. The pumpkin souffle was delish. I got a window view of the fountains. To get a patio view in order to listen to the music during the fountain show you have to get there 90 minutes before your reservation. I did not have such time so I settled for the window view. The waiter was lovely and kind enough to surprise us with a happy anniversary and birthday desserts.
Service was good, had to wait an extra 30 min to get outside table even though had a reservation. But the view was worth it. Had the scalops and the chilian seabass. . They were both a little over cooked for my taste.
To be fair, the food was pretty decent. But it took far too long to eat a simple lunch here. We sat at 12:30  when we were hungry and got our food at 1:40 by which time I had already passed the point of being hungry. It was odd as several tables around us who were seated after us were able to get their food - and some were even able to finish their entire meals - before we so much as glimpsed ours. Lunch without drinks set us back $100, and while I don't mind paying a lot for a good experience, this was not worth the Benjamin we dropped. I would take your business elsewhere if I were you, like we plan to do going forward.
I had high expectations going into this restaurant, and since it was conveniently located in our hotel, I thought "why not?" for a nice Christmas Eve lunch.. For the appetizers, we had the Tuna Carpaccio, Grilled Squid & Octopus, and some kind of steamed mussels dish. The Tuna Carpaccio and Grilled Squid & Octopus were good, but nothing spectacular. As for the mussels, a couple of them were not even open and for the few that I had, there was this really unpleasant taste that lingered in my mouth. I've never had mussels with that kind of foul taste before... ugh.. As for the entrees, speaking for everyone at my table, the resounding feedback? Too salty. . My brother, who ordered the Chicken Margherita since it was one of the "Chef's Selections", could not even finish his food. My sister, who ordered the Ricotta Ravioli, liked the ravioli, but said that the sauce was way too salty. My father, who seemed the most satisfied with his dish, had the Beef Fillet, and my mother had the Spaghetti Alle Vongole, which she thought was okay. I had the scallops, and the worst part of the dish was not the extremely salty rubber scallops, but rather the crunchy... undercooked risotto. . I would've loved to come back for dinner on the patio to enjoy the fountains with my meal, but that's okay. I'd rather not.
Had dinner here the day after Christmas. We made reservations 2 weeks before since the restaurant gets booked pretty quickly.  We were seated at a decent table inside for 8 people. Outdoor seating was available but it seemed too cold to sit outside.. . The service was very slow but then again it allowed us to enjoy the ambience of the restaurant and watch the Bellagio fountain show. . . I ordered the fig and prosciutto flatbread which was delish! I loved the thinness and crispness of the flatbread. The blue cheese was the right amount and the fig was the perfect complement for the prosciutto. I definitely recommend trying the flatbreads. . . Overall it was a good experience.
Overall, food was good but nothing exceptional. We ordered lamp Chops (45$) and their famous fig flat bread. I am a die hard fan of lamb chops but was not fascinated by their at all. Flat bread was ok but again, nothing crazy. Ambiance was good esp is you sit outside overviewing Bellagio's water show.
The wait after you order is pretty bad. It took over an hour to get out main course at lunch. Big waste of time. Can't say it's like this for everyone since even people who came later than us got their food earlier so I think it's just hit or miss based on disorganization. The food is OK. I wouldn't come here just for the food though. The only shining light to this experience is that they served us foie gras when it's not available for lunch. But it is available for dinner, so why not just make it available at all times instead of making people ask for it?
Food was absolutely delicious. Their service was marvelous and the view from our table was simply magnificent. We went here for our Christmas dinner and had our table near the patio glass wall. We could view the bellagio fountain, the Eiffel tower from there. . . Okay so food wise, I loved the gnocchi. And definitely try their free appetizer place of olives and bread. Its really tasty and quite unique.
Love this place, especially for lunch. Beef carpaccio is a must. Their flat breads and hamburger are always good. Get a table outside or inside by the window and enjoy the fountain show.
I really enjoyed my experience here. We were able to sit on the patio, which really enhanced the experience. There are gorgeous fountains that go off every half hour or so to music. The patio is situated facing the strip, so you have a great view and can help spark conversation. . . Our service was excellent. They have ipads for the menu, which is awesome when it comes to choosing a wine. They have a very extensive choice of amazing wines. I chose a white wine with our spicy Chicken flatbread. The flatbread was very good, which is to be expected at a nice restaurant on the strip! They also offer Bread with olives and olive oil for a little something to snack on. I really enjoyed the olives; considering the name of the restaurant, it was very fitting. . . Lastly, I got the cocoa pot for dessert. That was an incredibly decadent dessert and I highly recommend it. Only thing I would say is that it's slightly on the heavy side, which only matters because the temp in NV is usually in the upper 100's and makes you feel slightly sick afterwards.
Good Day. A week before Christmas we arrived in Las Vegas.  Visiting our daughter who lives in the area.. Truly memorable,  great food , excellent service and the fountain show was so sweet. Christmas songs, great food,  wonderful ambience. . Will definitely be back .
