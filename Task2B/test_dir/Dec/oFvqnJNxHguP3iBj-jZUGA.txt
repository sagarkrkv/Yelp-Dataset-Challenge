this made my night a free show by the Bellagio the water flowing everywhere with the music is just beautiful such a peaceful scene I would highly recommend if you walking on the Boulevard Las Vegas Blvd. you should definitely take a moment to relax and enjoy the view and listen to the music and the water show their beautiful at night also so don't be fooled don't just walk away take a nice stroll by then he loves you and enjoy the beautiful show
It is so pretty completely free and plenty of space ! I go as manny times as I can ! There are all so a lot of characters on the street by there!(: a five star performance! It's a must
Wanneer je in Las Vegas bent, dan mag je dit gewoon niet missen. Ga aan de straat zijde staan, zodat je overweldigd kunt worden door de prachtige muziek terwijl je naar het grootse waterfontijnen show te wereld kijkt. Ongelofelijk om te zien !  Van19u tot 00u00 om het kwartier en van 15u tot 19u om het half uur.
The Fountains of Bellagio are one of the well known attractions on the strip. And it's FREE, so it's hard to beat that! The water show is rhythemically synced to music and lights. They capture the attention of both young and old. Every trip that I have taken to Vegas has included the fountains.
We stop every time we are in town. Never a disappointment!
Just imagine the engineering it took for this place to come about with figuring out water pressure to create such a spectacular show played to music!  I know I'm a geek but it is quite a spectacular show.  No bad seat in the house. Bravo.
YES!!! This is one of the awesome wonders of Las Vegas.. Even as a local, I am always impressed when we are standing there.. They have a water show every 15 minutes, but different ones, set to different songs.. . This is one of those great spots we always bring visitors when we are down on the strip. In my opinion, it is best at night. . . Perfect night....Dinner on the Strip, then watch the fountain, then head to the Caesar's for dessert at Serendipity (although I suggest putting your name in at Serendipity first, it can be a wait)
