Maybe I shouldn't be writing on a review based on two free stays but the first one was free for winning a contest and the second stay was a free room for two days with our dog but I still had to pay for the pet feE $56 per night and the $28 resort fee.. . However for both stays, the rooms were great.  The first one had a deep Japanese style bath overlooking the strip (the shower in the middle of the bathroom was a bit interesting I guess it was so you can shower immediately after the bath).  But the room itself was very nice and comfortable.  Always a necessity when you visit Vegas with a non-partier or non-gambler.. . There were minor glitches (leftover pizza crust found by Apricot) bellman who after being tipped left the cart in the luggage room even though I mentioned that we were leaving directly).  Overall, having the pet area on the 14th floor instead of the hustle and bustle of the main floor was fantastic!. . The regular prices are too steep for me considering I have a lot of offers for free accommodations when I visit Vegas at least three times a year for family events.  The availability of various restaurants were good but pricey except for the Secret Pizza joint tucked in between Jaleo and Blue ribbon sushi.  And the pizza was delicious but I feel awkward eating between the pricier joints.  You can order a whole pizza to bring back to your room.. . If you get a great deal and want to stay at a nice newer place, give The Cosmopolitan a try! They always have good deals online on non-holiday-or midweek stays.
So I've been going to Marquee since it opened, mostly staying at the Jockey Club, Cosmopolitan's diminutive step child. Literally. It's nestled right below the Cosmo, allowing you to take advantage of some of Cosmo's benefits, at a fraction of the price, especially with a group of friends. But nothing's as good as the real deal and in the case of Cosmo, this place is evenbetter than I hoped. Booked a One Bedroom Terrace over Thanksgiving weekend. The room was pristine, from the huge bathroom complete with Japanese soaking tub, to the terrace overlooking the Strip. . . I got there at 12:30PM and my room was already all set. Check in was a breeze. Some call Cosmo's service impersonal, but I see them kind of like I see Virgin. Staff is there if you need them but if not, you never have to see them. I even checked out through the television in my room. Cool.. . But the best part about Cosmo, at least from this clubgoers perspective, is Marquee. Even up on the 55th floor, Marquee is just a zip down the elevator to the 2nd and 3rd floors. Unfortunately Marquee isn't free for hotel guests on Saturdays, so your best bet is purchasing a ticket online. Every other day Marquee is open is free for guests, though.. . One quick down side. An extra minibar charge showed up on my hotel bill and from what I'm reading, I'm not the only one this has happened to. . . All in all, though, this is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in my life. The style, brand and vibe of the place is as good as it gets. The variety of pools, lounges and restaurants both inside and outside also makes it possible to spend your entire Vegas stay at this one epic casino-hotel. In the winter, they've now added an ice rink where guests can put on skates in the desert for 5 bucks. From now on, Cosmo is my go to.
This hotel is part of Marriott, so you can use your Marriott points to book a room. If you stay here often you should start racking your points for a free room. And it's easy to book the room with your points. . . I have stayed in suites each time I have stayed at this hotel and I love the spacious open layout of the rooms. . . I believe they are very generous with upgrades. This is becausethe one time I booked a standard room, I was upgraded. It was when my girlfriends and I booked a 2 kings size bed room we were upgraded to a suite. The upgrade was quick and happened at the front desk while I was checking in. It was a fun surprise. . . The bar area in the rooms have a modern open layout. The bar is fully stocked. Their bathrooms are open and modern. The view is awesome. It's right in front of the water show so no need to head out to see that. Their balcony connects to the bedroom and the living area, so it's definitely more romantic. . . It's always easy to catch a cab right in front of the hotel. The hotel offers great services. Secret pizza, cafes, shopping, casino, clubbing is all offered in the hotel. The hotel itself has an edge and playful flare. . . They have a well laid out emergency route for any 911 emergencies. The staff seemed very competent and professional in the emergency evacuation when we called an ambulance on one of the nights.
This is the best hotel/casino in vegas. . . Location - right in the middle of everything. . . Shopping - there's some cool shops all throughout city center and within the cosmopolitan itself, if wanna get fancy tho head over to Crystals, bring your credit card and forget your conscience. . . Restaurants - during my recent stay we ate at : Holsteins awesome burger place, Blue Ribbon Sushi - fantastic, Jaleo - delicious tapas place, and Scarpetta - Scott conant's italian place - which I liked a lot, but I should have ordered something different. The room service breakfast was delicious and well portioned.. . The rooms - best on the strip, easily. We had a terrace suite in the west tower and it was straight out of a movie. The entire Cosmopolitan is artfully and beautifully decorated down to the last detail, every little nook and cranny of this place is designed to please the eyes and it accomplishes that marvelously. . . Service - every employee there was impressively accomadate and nice. You'll feel special here. The valet and bell service is ridiculously fast, convenient and polite. Everyone that works here looks happy. . . The casino - fun as can be. Every dealer we had was fun, smart and polite. . . The bars - all  the casino bars are nice looking have comfortable seating and pro level bartenders. . . The clubs - we went to Marquee and it was the coolest club I've ever been to, you'll feel like you're in a movie. We saw Sander Van Doorn and he killed it, I wrote a separate review for marquee, check it out. . . If you can afford to stay, eat and gamble here, it's all worth it, please do it, allow this place to be the base camp of your Vegas Adventure, you'll be so happy. Trust me. . . Thank you Cosmopolitan for the best Week I've had in Vegas in my life...so far.  . . Almost forgot - The fitness center - has all the essentials and is very well staffed. There's also outdoor tennis and it was fun. . . And.....The Identity rewards program is also my new favorite one in Vegas, sign up immediately and earn points on everything you buy in the casino. Even all the shops. Boom. Done
I expected to be treated better for the money that was spent. Customer service needs to improve.
Ok. The cosmo is considered a trendy, ultra hip resort hotel near the center of the strip. It's a pretty cool property overall, but what really drew me here was the opportunity to stay in a hotel that included a balcony foryou to hang out on and just chill. I booked it through a 3rd party travel site and got a sweet weekend deal. You will pay a small premium for the balcony rooms, but let me tell you: They definitely are worth it for the absolute best views in vegas. All the rooms at the Cosmo are suites with a fridge, microwave, minibar, etc. They are tastefully decorated and very spacious. But the feature attraction was the balcony. My room was on the side of the building facing the Bellagio fountains watershow. To be able to walk out on the balcony and see the show  from ABOVE the fountains  was absolutely awesome!! You can literally see the entire strip all lit up at night, and it is truly a sight to see. . They have an awesome Pool party/nightclub called Marquee. If you desire a quieter night's sleep be sure and ask for a room higher up, because the noise from the club can definitely be heard , even from the 39th floor. Not bothersome to me, but others might have a problem with it. Overall the Cosmo is a very nice property, and it's worth at least 1 stay there to experience the terrace suites.
By far the best hotel on the strip. Not a hint of smoke, perfectly located on the strip and the friendliest staff I've encountered on the strip. . . The rooms are massive! Bathroom, living room, and bedroom in 3 seperate partitions. Like NYC apartment. We had views of the Bellagio fountain and saw the show a dozen times. . . The gym, oh the beautiful gym on the 14th floor of the west tower was enormous! I was there everyday. They even had a boxing ring! Lol.. . If you can get a room at the Cosmo for your trip, I highly recommend.
Nice hotel and Casino bad customer service.  Trying to make reservations and talk with casino host is a pain and waste of time. Tried calling and after a series of transfers I was disconnected several times. . When finally got the casino hosts department left messages and never got a call back. They were suppose to send email to me the first time I talked to them but never got any email.
Best hotel in Vegas. Amazing hotel room with open floor plan from bathroom, living area, bed and porch. Gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains and Vegas strip. Friendly staff and good casino. Very trendy and younger crowd. Highly recommended.
Just stayed again at Cosmopolitan.  It was awesome. Room perfect. Drinks great. Recommend it 100%. Really improved.
I'm a fan of the Caesar's properties because I get practically everything comp'd.  In this visit we went off the grid and came here to gamble... and for Secret Pizza, of course!.. . I didn't have my frequent Identify card on me, so I pushed the "service" button on my slot for help.  It took a while, but someone came, and got me my Identity card.  Stephen's mom was playing a slot next to me and Lady Lucky was smiling on her.  It kept triggering, as was Stephen's machine. I was doing well, too.  The guy next to me was playng Top Dollar and he hit a big payout of $1800.  So I guess you can say Lady Luck was smiling on all of us.. . After a few hours we went to the 3rd floor for Secret Pizza . http://www.yelp.com/biz/secret-pizza-las-vegas?hrid=Qzv1s6CDAQJdskfslxI_Yw and picked up 3 slices and a 2 liter of diet coke for about $22.. . This casino has 4 levels, from shopping, gambling, dancing, and entertainment.  I really like this place, and hope to build up enough Loyalty Points for free stuff.
One of the best locations on the strip, it sits next door to Bellagio.  They really try hard to capture the essence of Vegas by theming up the place with modernized looks from the 60's and their James Bond themed bars. There are actually 2 Bond bars, the Vesper Bar and the James Bond Bar itself.  They also have their famous Chanelier Bar, with a gi-normous chandelier hanging down 3 entire floors with bars built around them.  It's really a beautifully designed casino inside, the public area's lounges and walkways have a sleek, colorful design that remind me of the 1960's but touched up to look modern.  There are several restaurants on the top floor that are impressive (Holsteins Burger joint has foie gras burgers!) including STK, Rose Rabbit Lie and the hidden pizza joint.  Their main attraction, though, is the Wicked Spoon which is my favorite buffet place.. . I've stayed here twice now, the first time on a Tues I upgraded to a suite and it was incredible!  The room was entirely automated with 2 bathrooms and a jacuzzi bath in the master, the room controlled by the TV (temperature, lights, music) as well as washing machine and a view of the Bellagio fountains on the patio, so you can here the music in the open air as well.  The 2nd time was a standard room, which was still really nice but nothing as exceptional as the suite.  It had a view of the fountains butdidn't open so you couldn't hear.  . . The Cosmopolitan is a fun place to stay and it's one of the best places on the Strip.  Restaurants and bars are cool, you really feel like you're in old time Vegas here, one of the best places to impress that special someone.
I want to tell you first of all that we had a great time at the Cosmopolitan.  Great rooms, great casino, friendly staff.  3 of my friends stay at your hotel regularly.  It was my first time.. . However, the experience we had at Marquee was disgusting!!!  Justen and his staff should be embarrassed!!!.  . As I mentioned in my earlier emails, I was looking for recommendations for a club with table/bottle service for 40-50 year olds as it was my friends 50th birthday.  You sent me to Justen.  I did not know he only worked for Marquee.   He said the club was perfect for us and he would set us up with a "great table".  I even tipped him $100 on the way in...  . . It was all 20 something patrons.  Not what we were told or even sold!!! They set us up with a table in the back corner by the bathroom.  It was horrible.  Couldn't have been further from the dance floor.  Not even in the ring. Then they triggered a fraud alert on my visa and they would not let anyone have any of the drinks even though they know we were staying in the hotel. What is that all about???   It took the waitress (Mary) over 30 minutes to re-process it. We were all standing there with our thumbs up our ass. . . Now the icing on the cake....Mary told me she was leaving for the night.  I signed the bill and included a 20% gratuity.  Then she comes back and asks for a tip for the bar back who kept up with the mixers etc...  She said the gratuity didn't include him.  I was so angry at that point that I just charged another $50 on my card.  Then I go to the bathroom and come back and our whole area was cleaned out and know one knew what was up.  I felt worked over and angry over the whole experience.  Disgusted!!!! . . The next day on check out neither of you were around.  They had some manager from Marquee call me and he said he would give me $50 towards my next visit to Marquee.  Seriously?????   . . You all should be embarrassed after us spending over $10,000 for 2 days.. . Absolutely angry that I stayed at your hotel after the night.
First time staying here for my bday and it was amazing all the way! The room we got came with a big balcony and the view was to die for..the room was big and clean and even better that it came with a microwave, fridge (with minibar all in one) & a dishwasher (we didn't use) BUT all the necessities you want and need. The hotel was gorgeous and all my friends loved it as well and def wanna stay there from now on :) oh & I booked with southwest vacations so it was a packaged deal and not too bad of a price if your sharing with friends and can split the cost!
We really enjoy staying at the Cosmopolitan. The rooms are stylishly modern decorated and the casino is hip with all its glassy glitz.  I wouldn't consider this a family hotel but good for us as a couple as we do not have young children.  The slick visuals and glass make this place interesting and classy.  We were disappointed that the one Italian restaurant we wanted to eat at here (and the main reason we stayed here this time) was closed for Thanksgiving week. Something to remember for future reservations - always check on the restaurants or stores that you want to visit first to see if they're open or still there...  Check-in and out was a breeze (the staff are extra nice). The only room complaint we have is that the water pipes in our room were extremely noisy all night (coming from other rooms as well!) and this was very disturbing and difficult.  Too bad, seems like the glitz is a facade for cutting corners on construction. Too bad.  We did like that the hotel has free and easy parking, although they get you with a high resort fee on top of the room rate (most Marriott Hotels do this - NOT NICE MARRIOTT!). But, at least this place didn't charge for parking too... The little coffee bar near reception is horrible and unhappy not nice people work there - and their coffee is nasty... the lady never acknowledged me and never said thank you or you're welcome even after I said it three times! But, overall, I would stay here again because of the convenience on the strip, it's easy to walk everywhere, and the large stylish rooms are very clean and nice....
This is a very hotel. They treat you with utmost respect.   We checked in and they had  to take us on a 30 minute tour of the hotel to your room,.  We stayed in a bungalow which was equipped with a elevator .  It had 3 floors and elevator stopped on each floor.  On.the first floor there was a full kitchen and a modern living room. The second floor has a sleep area and a separate room to chill in and  the 3rd level was the jacuzzi floor. . .   The bungalow was connected to the club so when we walked out the back door we at the real live party or in day time we at the pool area.  . . The butler's  came to our room with the room service and set up a nice displau. They also  mix up our drinks. Wow! That was a treat.
Love this hotel! Look forward our Vegas trips!. Like the fact the balcony overlooked the Bellagio.. The place is classy and clean, which I love!
This was an up and down experience. The service was definitely lacking: upon arrival- the absence of a bellhop to help with bags, the hair in the shower of our room, the stain on the sofa of our room (beyond disgusting). However I love that the rooms have balconies and some great views. The casino is nice and the location is great since it is pretty much smack in the middle of the strip. However, for the cost there are definitely better options.
Stayed in a 1-bedroom fountain view room for my husband's 40th birthday, 31st floor, West Tower.  I didn't know which tower was better--I would choose the East Tower next time just because it's closer to the restaurants and the strip.  We ended up having to walk over there every day.. . I loved the room and our view was incredible.  The bed was very comfortable. I loved the bathroom and the huge shower. The room was perfect as a meeting place for our group of 4 to hang out, mix drinks, watch football and enjoy drinks on the balcony.  We stayed Saturday-Wednesday in December and heard no noise.  The hotel was really only crowded on the Saturday night.. . What keeps it from 5 stars:  there are no drawers anywhere for your clothes--I had to live out of my suitcase.  We only had housekeeping come once and they did not replenish some items like cotton balls and washcloths.  At check-in, we weren't told anything about Wi-Fi, club access, etc., it was mainly just here is your key.  . . We had already eaten at several of the restaurants on previous visits.  This visit we tried STK and China Poblano (along with the Henry and secret pizza) and really liked them both.  The Chandelier Bar was not good this trip however and we will be skipping it next trip.. . Overall, I love this hotel and it will be hard to stay anywhere else.
Who doesn't like staying at the newest, most modern, in-the-middle-of-the-strip hotel?. . What's even better? A free room! I've been comped a room here twice and the rooms are nothing like any of the other hotels. Plenty of space, clean, new, etc.. . The casino is spacious, and I've been there so many times, I know where all the tables are. I do have to say, they need more Pai Gow tables. And I wish they had a poker room, but I love playing craps and blackjack here. The dealers are funny and what's most important is that the cocktails come often and frequently.
I recently stayed at the Cosmopolitan and had the best experience ever! Our room was beautiful and had the a great view of the strip. We can see the Bellagio fountain right below our balcony. I had so much fun that I accidentally left my beloved $230 Tory Burch sandals behind. I was sure I would never see them again. When I called the lost and found, the housekeeping lady actually turned them in! I was so happy I wanted to tip her, but they didn't know who turned them in. I must say, thank you Cosmopolitan for providing top quality service and having a very reputable and honest staff.
The worst ever check in experience at this hotel. They want to charge $180 and $50 for early checkin. This establishment does not care about if you are marriot platinum member pr what not. Front desk is caos they dont even a standard response for common questions. Marriot member dont bother coming to this establishment because you will not be treated the same. All these guy care about is their small fees no regard to your loyalty to Marriot brand as staff told me they just work with marriot not real affiliation.
Came here in December, I booked a terrace suite fountain view room. My flight to Vegas got cancelled, and I went from an itinerary of arriving at 1pm to 10pm. Upon check in I was put in room 1533 of the west end tower. Exhausted from multiple airplane changes from Oakland to Ontario to Vegas, I was very happy to finally arrive in my room (bonus points for having ambient music playing). . . As far as price goes, I had very high expectations for this room considering I booked in low season and still spent around $1000 (maybe more) for the weekend stay. This room met those expectations and I cannot complain. This is quite possibly one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in. The bed was extremely comfortable (granted I only spent 6hrs on it the whole weekend) and the room size was superb (bar area, separate living room, 2 full bathrooms, and a balcony with a great view). . . We had a party of 10 people staying all over the strip and this room was the perfect spot for everyone to meet in. The seperate living room / open bar area gave plenty of space for everyone in our group to be seated and get comfortable. The tv's have auxiliary inputs so you can hook up your own music. Have a big party and need a place to meet? This is the room. Need a place to pregame without people feeling cramped? This is the room. Need a good night's sleep? C'mon, you're in Vegas, no one sleeps in this place. . . It's the little things that we take for granted that seperate this hotel from any other. From personalized key cards and tv greetings to auxiliary cords for your music. This hotel definitely knows what they're doing and I highly recommend this place. The Cosmopolitan epitomizes what Vegas is- whether you're here to party, gamble, escape, eat amazing food, or all of the above, this is it.
My second time to check in this hotel. But my first time to have a terrace room with city view and fountain view. This hotel is amazing. Everything here from the front to back is very well decorated, fancy , elegant and modern. The rooms are very clean and modern. They have a very good customer service. If you check in here, you don't want to go somewhere else anymore because they have everything here. They have the marquee club which is the most popular club in the strip. They have good restos here too. My favorite is the China poblano where China meets Mexico. Wow food is amazing and authentic. I am not going to wonder why this hotel is very expensive, because this hotel is worth more than five star. The designs on the wall, the bathroom, the furnitures, the little details, the bed, the ceiling, everything is just so perfect. Definitely this place really looks after their customers comfort and convenience. Whenever you check in here, you take pride of being here because this hotel holds so many things to be proud of and ideal place to stay if you want a very worthy and quality vacation here in LV. I will definitely come back here and definitely recommend this to the world. Kudos Cosmo!!!!
This trip to the cosmopolitan was for the kid Cudi concert at venue "the Chelsea". We had general admission tix for $75 which was the ground level, standing with the crowd.  My friend and I thought the crowd was shaking the ground from jumping but we think the ground level moves pumping up the crowd to jump even more!. . We checked out the theatre.seating level and it was a nice view so both admission areas were pleasant.  Would definitely recommend going to this venue for an event!
Whenever you walk into The Cosmopolitan, the stress of the world leaves you behind.  From the very modern look in the lobby, there is always a friendly and welcoming face that help you out.  The rooms are large with everything you would need, impeccably decorated, and always with amazing views.  the Views from our corner room from the 58th floor were just amazing of the Strip and the fountains at the Bellagio. . The concierge was amazing the set up our entire trip. (Eden)  Was great she set up everything from Dinner at STK, Helicopter flights, A show at MJ, The Gun Range, Dinner at Capos, fresh flowers in our room and Car service to and from anyplace we needed to go.. . The only down side to the entire trip was the Jack hammering all morning long from the demolition of the front hotel.
I went to Vegas with a few friends and family this year for my birthday. We booked two rooms for two nights at the cosmopolitan. After we checked in, our first impression of one of our rooms was awful. The shower head was completely missing in one of our rooms. There was a USED towel hanging on the shower door and the shower floor was dripping wet. We politely contacted the front desk to inform them of the situation. After about 90 minutes of being transferred to different managers, we almost considered checking into a different hotel for lack of service. Finally, we were given two new rooms, but unfortunately, they were no longer adjacent to one another. They were very far away from each other and it was not convenient. Worst of all, one of the new rooms we were given had BLOOD STAINS on the comforter. Completely unacceptable and disgusting!!!!! When we called to inform the manager, all they did was remove a room service charge. Really? For not meeting basic sanitation standards? It was the worst Vegas hotel room I've ever stayed in. I urge you not to stay at the cosmopolitan if you want to have a pleasant experience in vegas!
This is a great place to walk around. The casino has nice decorations and I don't smell the smoke at all. Weren't to check out the ice skate room on the 4th floor. Must check out!
I love Cosmo. . . Stylish upscale chic. My number one in Vegas. Rooms are great. Penthouses even greater. . . Bars fancy. People beautiful. Service most excellent. . . Marquee day night club. . . . Not so much food selections though to eat at the hotel. Also rooms should all have bath tubs. . . Other than that I love cosmo.
This is Absolutely my Favorite Hotel to stay in Las Vegas!  Free Gorgeous Rooms, Free Upgrades, Decadent Gourmet Restaurants and Eateries and Beautiful Peeps who frequent.  I  The Cosmopolitan Hotel and  Casino!
Cosmo Skating Rink Review: This place is absolutely charming during winter! Ice Skating, S'mores, Hot Chocolate, Fire Pits, Cocktails and fake snow! Love it! Only FAIL was one worker at the skate booth with about 20 people in line and they were out of a lot of skate sizes.
This is a solid hotel and my second stay here because I had a great experience first time.  Now why did I give it 3 stars as oppose to a 4 or 5?. . Cosmopolitan opened around end of 2010, marketed as a fun hotel with just right amount of naughtiness, which of course drove the party and rowdy crowd there.  After 4 years opening there are obvious sign of wear from the shenanagins.  In my wraparound suite there were unknown dark spots on my sheets, wallpaper closed to the floor started to peel, nicks on the furnitures, and flat looking sofa cushion.  Not to mention dust bunnies on marble floor in the water closet and strands of hair on the shower tiles, cleaniess that should be associated at every 5 stars hotel.
When I go to Vegas with my friends as a group of kids most of whom are still freshly 21 years old, I love staying on the strip and wondering my way to the Cosmopolitan. . . Now unformulated I have to do Vegas on a budget and I can not stay here. We have to stay at the cheep hotels and make the trek, but the track is almost always worth it. The casino is so cool inside, with great eats like secret pizza. The games are new, and the staff is friendly. Marquee the night club is a personal favorite (even tho I never feel stylish enough to get in) because everyone here seems to be young and fashionable. They really make the vibe that they want work. . . Their drink service is absolutely my favorite. The portions are bigger, the pours are more generous, and everything tastes better. They do drinks right, and I am willing to play their games which do have a slightly higher minimum because their drink service is so good. It's really what keeps us coming back.
These elevators take you very high! I would like to congratulate cosmopolitan for having the best elevators in Vegas since they always smell of pot and grass and one would get high just by trying the elevators a few times. I was just there two nights ago for Marquee and damn, I couldn't walk straight after I got out of the elevator.This year I didn't stay there since my gf got really sick because of our rooms unsanitary conditions(pics posted). Since my complaint last year, due to our disastrous experience at Cosmo, Rico Ramirez from their damage control team contacted me and asked me to call him . After giving mea bunch of BS he promised refund but did not do anything.. This hotel is the haven for punk hoodie kids and black gangsters. Just stay away from this dump!
Surprisingly, the accommodations are a little worn already. However, I love the casino area. Very nice!
I remember watching all those glamorous TV spots about Cosmo, and I told myself repeatedly I have to stay at this hotel the next time I go to vegas and I finally got a chance this Christmas! I was beyond excited when I booked the "terrace one bedroom" for 5 days 4 nights.. . I realize at this point Cosmo is not exactly a brand new hotel anymore, millions of people had already visited this vegas hot spot. With that being said, the kid in me was still wowed when I arrived at the checkin/concierge area, who can beat those 8 digitalized giant floor-to-ceiling columns? (BTW, look out for "monarch," this visual experience drapes with hypnotizing music in the backgound was just sheer glamorous and sophistication that is cosmopolitan!!). . Upon arrival of our room, BF and I were immediately impressed by the chic decor. Though the entire room was beautiful, we've encountered several "malefactions" and quality control issues. So the next day, we went back to the check in area and notified the management (through the help of Aaron from the check-in desk) and they upgraded us to the famous "wraparound terrace suite!!!!" The wraparound terrace suite accompanied a breathtaking view on the strip and the management even had a box of chocolate along with an apology card waiting for us when we arrived in the room! . . Not to be a complainer, but we again encountered more quality control issues along the rest of our stay, so we gave the management (Spoke to Manager Christine Monson) a list of problems when we checked out. Other than more apologies, she even issued us another $200 credits back to our account! Our stay with Cosmopolitan was truly a treat, the entire hotel staffs went all out to make sure of our satisfactory, the professionalism Cosmopolitan delivered was just unbelievable!. . Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas offers more than just nice rooms or chic, advanced digitalized decor throughout the entire building, it also houses the most delicious and sophisticated restaurants and bars on the strip, not to mention I had the best spa experience of my life at Sahra Spa & Hammam!! I absolutely adore this upscale hotel and I cannot wait to go back for more. . . You should try it, too!!
Fantastic fantastic fantastic. This hotel continues to win me over each time I stay. From the decor to the food this hotel brings it.  . . At check in my room wasn't ready so not only was I immediately accommodated with another room but I was upgraded for free to a suite. How amazing is that. The room was over 1000 sqft and had multiple views from each of its windows. Lovely considering it was 34 that night and we were able to see the water show happening at the hotel below.. . The suite was on the 25th floor in the west tower and was decorated beautifully. As you walked in the room there was a light switch to the left that had two buttons a hello button a day a goodbye both of which controlled all of the lights within. So you didn't have to turn off each light individually as you were entering or leaving (love the convenience) .. . Next upon turning on the TV a good morning/good afternoon/good evening message was displayed with my name making me feel appreciated and noticed. (It's always the little things in life that mean the most). The main screen also offered a checkout option which helped and was very convent for those who don't like to wait in lines especially during busy times in the month. . . And lastly for me what did it was the comfy bed. I slept like a baby. The pillows and mattress were perfect not too solf and not too firm just right. . . There are so many added bonuses that this hotel offers and each time I'm  introduced to new ones. I will definitely be back next month.
Great looking Hotel.. Very busy but conveniently located on The Strip.. The Famous Buffet looks good but I haven't tried it yet.. Lines were two long on Christmas Eve.. The Burger Joint was Awesome. Highly recommended.
Stayed here for a week.. Not as "new" as I expected. There are scratches on the wall. Some stains on the sheet. But overall it is ok (probably not acceptable for the sake of a five stars hotel) . . Let's start with some pros first:. - huge balcony and fantastic view of the strip. - big room with dividers (our room is the Terrace One Bedroom I believe). We put the kids in the living room, close the sliding door and it becomes a private bedroom! Nice choice. - it has a Japanese tub where kids had lots of fun. You get to see the view of strip too while showering!!!. - it has sink, dish washer, and microwave. Very convenient for people with kids. - there are chinese channels in the room!. - they provide q-tips and swabs (never seen these before). . Now, some cons:. - the "hightech" curtain. We spent 30min on the first night trying to figure out how to roll down the curtains in the shower!!!! You have to have some wisdom to do so. (By high tech I do not mean electronics. It's just the way you roll it down is "abnormal"). - and then we spent another 30min trying to figure out how to turn off all the lights without shutting off the main switch in the room . - we lived in the 63rd floor and when the cars drove by, it still sounded like it's next door. . - the toilet was a pain. It is very nice but... It's in a closed room!!! It gives me claustrophobia seriously. And the door won't stay open so I ended up having hubby hold on to the door every time I'm in it. Weird. - the fridge was a joke: you can't put anything in it. Once you touched the sensors you are charged for $7/drink. I tried to fit a water in it and I accidentally knocked out a whole roll. That was a catastrophe!. . But overall it is a nice place to stay. I see it more as a hotel version of the timeshare. Very family friendly.. . For the price of it, I think the inside can be a bit more clean!
I HAVE THE BEST BOYFRIEND IN THE ENTIRE WORLD for choosing Cosmo. . My first time staying at the Cosmopolitan! I've always wanted to stay here since the hotel first opened! My amazing boyfriend booked us two nights here. From the moment of our visit everything was great! The staff here is properly trained, so friendly and very welcoming! They placed us in a Terrace Studio on the Eastside. God, I must say...I fell in love with the view. It is divine! The room layout was perfect and was so modern. Cosmopolitan exceeded my expectations and I couldn't be more happier with our visit.
My BF and I stayed at the Cosmopolitan last year in June for EDC. It was fantastic. the suite was comfortable, spacious, and clean. The bed, sheets, and pillows felt like heaven, especially after a whole night of dancing. The shower was huge! The hot tube was pretty small but still a nice amenity to have. The view was great and there was more sink space than other hotels have. Over all it was a great experience. I would love to stay there again.
