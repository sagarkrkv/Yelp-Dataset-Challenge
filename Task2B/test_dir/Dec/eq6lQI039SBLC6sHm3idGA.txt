Meh.. maybe I needed to be drunk to enjoy THIS  pizza.
I found it, so that was a plus! I went in and ordered a slice and was supremely pleased with the flavor as well as the perfect crunch on the crust! A must-eat in Vegas, for sure!
No Ranch Necessary for this hidden gem. Follow the pizza aroma and maybe you'll be lucky enough to discover what is, secret pizza at the Cosmopolitan. The perfect slice of pizza after a concert made to order. Fun atmosphere complete with Beer on tap and classic arcade games.
The secret pizza shop is worth the search. I would give directions but I don't like getting people lost.   3rd floor of the cosmopolitan shopping center, then ask another restaurant for directions. .    Great old school NY pizza. Good prices, slices, great staff, nice variety. A great escape from the craziness of vegas, although Iwas there at 11 am on a Tuesday in December.
I wouldn't say it's much of a secret anymore but regardless I always make a stop when in town.   The white pizza is incredible.  The sausage and meatballs are out of this world.  Great crust.  Great sauce.  Very friendly service.  I'm a huge fan.
Located in The Cosmopolitan down a corridor of Italian albums you will find some of the greatest pizza in the area.  This place stays open late and gets the job done.  White Pizza add Italian Sausage and Garlic.
If you're looking for something delicious to round out a night of bar hopping on the Strip, Secret Pizza can't be missed. One bite of these over-sized slices, and you'll feel like you're in New York instead of the dessert.. . It's existence is an open secret, but you still may have trouble finding it tucked away down an unmarked hallway on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan. At over $5 a slice it's a bit on the high side. But, you may have already spent $15 on a drink at the club, so why pinch pennies now? From the sauce to the toppings, everything tastes like an authentic New York style pizza. They make your standard pepperoni or mushroom pies with great skill, but you can get something edgier too. . . The place is small with no seating. Try to grab a seat on the mall floor by the pool table.
I love Secret Pizza! They keep it simple -- white sauce pizza or red sauce pizza with sausage. It's just not so secret anymore and I hear there are long lines after Marquee clubbers get out (I haven't been around to witness it). It's quick and simple pizza that's delicious. Bonus points for the arcade games inside. . . Since there really isn't much space to eat inside here, you can grab your pizza to go and grab a table just outside in the common area. There's a pool table and a few chairs.
Great pizza. Very friendly staff. Slices are very big and you can add additional toppings to their already made pizzas. Cool find.   Grab a slice, a glass of wine and walk out front to the sofas by the pool table.
The absolute best pizza I have ever had!!! The crust is thin, and crispy, they double bake it. The cheeses are flavorful and delicious, but not too greasy. I love that it is by the slice, so you can try without getting the whole pizza. It's affordable and hip. LOVE IT!!!!
I ordered the supreme pizza here and it was literally the best pizza I have ever had. The flavor in their pizza packs a punch. This place is kinda neat cause it's a little hard to find but the pictures on yelp will help you. The shop itself is super tiny and you don't really have much seating so you'll have to get some pizza and go. Definitely the best kept secret in Vegas! :)
This joint is BOMB. I had known about it for some time but have never gone and just happened to stumble upon it when my boyfriend and I were looking for Jaleo which is right next to the Secret Pizza place. We ordered the meatball, sausage, and pepperoni pizza and it was HELLA good! Definitely a chill place with a cool vibe and the perfect stop for a quick, great quality lunch or a drunken munchie at 3 in the morning. Good stuff!
Yummy and cheap!  In my last visit, I gave it 4 stars. This visit I am bumping it to FIVE, yes 5 yelp stars.. . Its probably the tastiest thin crust pizza in the Strip.  Its not really that hidden.  Go to the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, find the pool table (which probably kids are goofying off at) and you'll see a hallway of records.  There's that so-called pizza place.. . We came here with Stephen's mom and each got a slice of something different. We wanted 3 diet cokes, and the guy suggested getting a 2-liter of diet coke for $6.50 versus 3 separate cup of cokes for $4 each.  Wow, what a nice guy!  He could have easily had a $12 sale on drinks, but saved us $5.50.. . So 3 slices plus a 2-liter came to $22.  We took our slices down the hall and watch snotty 12 year olds attempt to play billiards.. . Secret pizza is, IMHO, the hidden gem of Las Vegas.
Definitely a good place to go if you're just escaping Marquee. And I know you just got out from the horrendous stairway, so now you're suddenly starving. The sweet smell of cheese and tomato sauce isn't helping, just follow your nose and it will lead you to the secret hallway to the place they call Secret Pizza.. . If you found the secret because the line is a mile long, sorry it's going to feel like a century to get in. I would avoid it between 12-2am, but they close at 5, so get your timing right! You can always call for a whole pie. The prices are pretty cheap for Vegas.. . For those not staying at Cosmo, it's great because there is plenty of seating outside.
This is the best pizza I've ever tasted. I know my East Coast friends are a little skeptic about this assertion. I don't even know how to describe it or why it's so good. It just is. Go try it for yourself. If you can find it.... . . It's on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Just go up the escalators by the Liberace Rhinestone Rolls Royce on the first level or the escalators by the All Saints store on the second level. Look for the pool tables and there will be a hallway lined with vintage record album covers. It's next to a sushi restaurant. . . The service is always quick and friendly. The prices are a little steep for pizza and a drink. Almost $20 for 2 slices and 2 sodas. . . Please try this please and tell me if I'm wrong! If this is not the best pizza you've ever tasted...let me know where I can find better pizza!!
Inside of Cosmo.. Love the thin crust pizza! Hidden gem, gotta try finding it! Long line so be ready.
This place is a hidden gem in the Cosmopolitan Hotel!  Walk down a little hallway on the third floor and discover this treasure!  It is not mentioned or listed on any signs posted in the hotel, hence the name Secret Pizza. We ordered pepperoni and sausage, a white pizza, and a mushroom pizza for a party in a suite and we were not disappointed!  Delicious pizza!
The great meatball topping saves this place. I was told that this place was the bomb, so maybe my expectations were too high. The cheese was lacking and was nothing out of the ordinary, the staff was somewhat rude (just stared at us when we walked up to order and was not engaging), and the price for what you get was pretty high. I'm not a fan of thin crust (and didn't know that's how it was), but the crust was not crispy on the bottom like most thin crusts, giving us really floppy pizza slices, so the cheese slid off trying to pick them up. Watch out for the grease, too. At least it was prepared and baked quickly.. .  I get that hotel/casino restaurants run that sort of price, but for the quality and amount of food, we should have just looked off the strip for a better pizza place.
Woooo pizza!!! A SECRET pizza place?! Awesome!!. . On a recent bachelorette trip my friends and I decided to make it our personal mission to find this secretive pizza joint after hearing about it from the bride's fiance. We navigated the area based on some Yelp photos and were actually very closeby when we got "lost". Imagine our excitement when we found THE HALLWAY!! We decided to each get 2 humongous slices of the pre made combination, pepperoni, and cheese toppings. . -The cheese was very tasty with a slightly thin crispy crust. It was indeed pizza heaven for us UNTIL we decided to sprinkle too much parmesan...making the sodium level skyrocket and our mouths dry as a desert on our drive home to LA...hence my minus one star.. -The combination was pretty decent but nothing too special topped with big slices of sun dried tomato, bell pepper, olives, onions.. . At $5-6 a slice its really not too bad so it'll be fun to bring along new people as a little joke.
This place hits the spot, and what makes it better is finding a joint most people won't even notice is there. My boyfriend and I had heard about Secret Pizza and always meant to visit but just never took the time to search it out. We made a point to find it today for lunch and I'm so glad we did.. . I'm not sure what to say that hasn't already been written by fellow Yelpers, but this pizza is really good. One slice was enough for me for lunch. I ordered the sausage and peperoncini and thought it was great! My traditional guy had the cheese. Both had a thinner, crispy crust that New York-style devotees will covet. Both slices were hot and fresh. We also appreciated the friendliness of the staff and just how kind they were (makes a big difference to me... not sure how others feel about that). Our server was so polite and went through all of the available pizzas with us with patience. The prices were reasonable,even though I think they may be more than what has been mentioned in previous reviews. A potential downside is that there were only two chairs in the entire space, so this may be better as a "grab and go" option. Still, worth a visit! Super fun to feel like a Las Vegas insider as you effortlessly walk down the "secret" hallway.
After a long night at Edc, we came here for a snack before bed. I've never heard of a secret pizza place near marquee. It is very inconspicuous and I don't think you would see it unless someone pointed it out. The pizza was ok, the slices were large. The line is long if you go when people are coming from marquee. The place thing about it is you can go chill and eat in the massive seating areas just outside the entrance.
3.5 stars. good pizza but not hard to find a pizza that tastes good fresh out the oven but this place didnt live up to hype or worth waiting in the line out the door.  This would be the perfect spot if you were drunk and found yourself here but i it too greasy.
Awesome pizza by the slice!  Just wish they had an option to get a whole pie that wasn't so large.
Closest I can get to the greasey goodness that is New York City pizza, here in Vegas. . . Secret Pizza is located inside Cosmo, third floor I believe. It's hard for me to remember... even though I've been here dozens of times, I'm not sure that any of them were sober. Once you've seen the pool tables though, know that you are very close!! Follow the record cover decorated hallway.. . Pizza slizes are between $4 & $5 bucks, a whole pie starts at $28 and they are HUGE. I'm pretty simple so I tend to stick with cheese or pepperoni slices... so I can only really speak on those - and they are delicious!. . I think goodness that I had a coworker back home who was kind enough to direct me here. It took a few tries for me to find the place but that made finally eating here ridiculously fun. . . It's worth the hunt, promise!
Secret Pizza? More like Not-So-Secret Pizza... this place is most definitely the worst kept secret in Vegas.. . My friends and I left Drai's Nightclub to take a cab to the Cosmopolitan and seek out this hidden gem. We waited ~40 minutes in line.. . I don't really even know what I ordered, but it was a slice with red sauce, pepperoni, mushrooms, and some other toppings. It was really good. But I might just think so because I had a good amount of alcohol in my system. As soon as I finished my slice, I grabbed the crust off of my friend's plate and finished that as well. Heh.... . $6 per slice. Not much seating. Take your precious pizza and go.. . By the way, it's located on the 3rd floor somewhere in between two restaurants... not sure. I was intoxicated. Just follow the drunk people!
I just got one slice of pizza because it was crazy overpriced. It was good. I'm not going to say it was bad but absolutely NOT worth $6. That's way overpriced I can get an entire pizza with that. And it was so crowded can't believe people go here so much. The drinks were $4 for a regular cup..just a cup not even a cap for it so it was hard to hold. It was about a dollar worth of drink too. Very overpriced.
Perfect for quick meal after the club. Especially if your date is passed out and your hungry. Top level, next to the sushi restaurant hidden in the back furthest from the elevator.
Such a fun stop to make while in Vegas.  Granted, it's in the Cosmo and I usually don't stay near it, but it's worth the trek.  You go down an unmarked hallway that is lined with records.  The pizza is superb.  There are some counters that you can stand at to eat, or you have to find a spot to sit down in the main area of the Cosmo.
Horrible. Fucking. Experience. No level of deliciousness would justify how rude these guys were.
I fell In love with this place with every step down the secret path finding pizza chefs tossing andspinning the dough in the air.  There is a fun atmosphere here, I was in front of this little kid who got to try and spin the dough only after he ran to clean his hands in the restroom it was fun to see.. . The pizza is off the hook hands down one of the best pizza places I've ever had the fortune of visiting and will probably remain there for life.  They always reheat your slice and you could add extra toppings.  They do refill soda and you could catch the wall of art dollars next to the cash register that's a lot of fun try to spot the hulk you can't miss it.  . . I can't wait to comeback during every Vegas trip.
So good we went to it twice in 12 hours. Once at 2am after dancing and then for lunch the next day. Tried a few different slices. The pepperoni, sausage and banana peppers, and the ricotta were our faves, but you can't go wrong. Not too bad on pricing, especially for vegas. Also it's open 24 hours.  Brooklyn style and the crust has just the right amount if crunch. Staff us friendly. Clean.
Much ado about nothing.. . The pizza was thin and a little greasy.  . The taste wasn't unique.. Not saying this was bad, just average.. We visited this place based on the recommendation. of the person who checked us into the hotel.. . This place is not worth visiting.. It might be "secret" pizza, but it's not great pizza.
Great white pizza! A huge slice of pizza that really hit the spot. The workers were very sweet and helpful. . . My only two complaints were that the Parmesan cheese in the shakers was not very fresh and there was also a napkin shortage.
Straight up, the best pizza ever. I didn't care for the generic stuff, but the meatball pizza was phenomenal! We went back twice. So good. Too good.
One of the best secrets on the strip, pizza is good nice chewy crust but not like rubber heat lamp pizza. Any local that doesn't know about this place doesn't know the strip
It is not a secret anymore but it is still pretty secretive I guess.  I found the place through the Yelp reviews so I tried to see how secretive this place really is.  Looked for signage while in Cosmo or a sign outside the place and found nothing.  Sneaky!  But luckily, the place isn't hard to find because once you get on the third floor, you see a bunch of folks munching on their pizza.. . Came a little bit after midnight on Christmas and luckily it wasn't packed.  Waited about 10 minutes and was able to order a slice of pizza.  Ordered a slice of the white pizza.  At first, the server (or do you call the guys pizza slice giver...he doesn't actually serve you...) looked and they were out of it and said we had to wait 15 minutes but luckily, the pizza maker told him that they had one ready in the back of the oven.  Winner winner pizza 4th meal dinner!  Fresh pizza right out of the oven.  For around $6, you get the ricotta with garlic and mozzarella.  Looked for a place to eat inside on the counters but it wasn't particularly clean so we decided to just take it outside.. . Split this with my sister and we both thought it was OK.  I can see how this can be AHHHHMAZING if you were drunk (Almost everything is).  I didn't drink so it was just OK.  The dollops of ricotta were the best part of the pizza.  Very creamy when biting into those places where it had ricotta.  The pizza was hot and the cheese was melty but I couldn't get over how salty it was.  I felt the burst of salt pellets with every bite.  No bueno (again... probably great after a night at Marquee or any other club in town). . A good place to come and say you have tried.  With all the other places throughout Vegas (and after a night of clubbing), this place wouldn't be on my list.  The place has its gimmick but the pizza is just decent and the place needs to be kept up a bit better.  Counters need to be tended more often, Napkin holders need to be refilled...
This is a hidden gem. I've had much better pizza but come on... the price and the taste/quality combination on the Las Vegas Strip... you can't complain.. . Staff was fun and personable. Go try it! If you can find it ;)
Other than the long wait (at times) for their pizza by the slice this place is delicious especially when you order it by the box !. . You can't go wrong with the white pizza seems to be very popular.  Try ordering a full box by phone and skip theline when you want to pick it up. . . Long story short.... It hits the spot at 3 am after Marquee.
Fantastic NY style pizza with a twist. I loved it!
Everything about this place is great the food, the atmosphere, the people. The staff is nice and I love that they spin the dough right in front of you. I got a slice of pepperoni and took it up to my room to eat. The pizza was the perfect amount of grease and the pepperoni was amazing!  The only thing is I wish I had some change on my to play the games. I loved the place so much I went back for dinner later that night.
This SECRET  PIZZA was a secret for about 5 stays at the Cosmo. Now that I know where it is its my favorite late night snack. Ask for it well done and the crust will be perfect. The staff was great, they actually recognized me from the night before....I guess I've become a regular.
This pizza is the best pizza ever ! Pricing is good, and so worth the wait even if it's an hour. If you're in Vegas at Marquee you have to go !
Another alternative to late night munchies after a club in Vegas! Secret pizza definitely has a spot in my heart. My boyfriend decided that I should try this place since we were staying at the cosmo. I've always heard really good things about this but have never actually been because I always end up at Earls after getting out of the clubs.  Found our way around in this hidden gem through a short alley. It wasn't a long line thank goodness. With literally 4 chairs in this hole in the wall your best bet is to scoot next to someone elbow it down and eat your pizza among those others. I ordered the combo/supreme and my boyfriend had the pepperoni. Omgggg it was delicious the entire crust of the pizza was crispy and the cheese and topping just married together. Add some pepper flakes and garlic powder and you are set my friend. I'm so happy I finally got to try it! Next time we are ordering the whole pie. More cost efficient :) plus more pizza nom nom!!
by far the best pizza west of Mississippi! price went up a little bit but still worth the price! soda's are free refills.
Located in The Cosmopolitan Hotel.  I actually stumbled upon this place as I was sitting nearby with my friends.  It's so secret that it's literally not even listed on their maps or signs at the Hotel.  There's no sign to the entrance.  It is right next to the Blue Ribbon Sushi Restaurant and near Cosmo's Marquee Nightclub.  They open until like 4-5am usually.  Lines could be long, but this restaurant is a take-out place.  There's only a handful of bar-like stools where you can eat on a counter by a couple of old school game machines.  It's warm, loud, and crowded so I suggest you find a seat outside.  There's a complimentary pool table just in front of the entrance with seats around it.  Our family just ate our pizza there.. . Waited 45 minutes for a whole pie of pizza.  It is overpriced, but it was still satisfying.  We ordered half Pepperoni and Half Sausage and Mushroom and it costed about 30 dollars.  They sell liters of soda or beer too.  The pizza was good. I want to come back to try the white pizza slice for sure.  Nothing too special about this place other than the idea that it's a secret. Overly hyped and over priced, but will definitely satisfy your pizza cravings.
Secret Pizza is a hole in the wall kind of pizza place. Definitely one of the more reasonable priced places in vegas. Benefits are that they are open late and their per slice is decently price.. . If you are planning to order a whole pizza, call ahead. It is much cheaper for a whole pizza but takes about an hour. For another $10 you can "cut the line", and they'll push your order forward. . . I had what everyone else recommend here. All good, definitely greasy. . . Their water machine doesn't work, just a heads up if u were looking for a cup of water.
Line took FOREVER but was somewhat efficient. Pizza was only decent. I would never wait again. Greasy pizza. Staff seems a bit sketchy.
This place is no secret, it's on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo, just look for a long dark hallway lined with picture frames of random shit. The line for this place was nearly out the door when I came on Christmas Day, which was also my very 1st visit here. I can see why the lines are so long...because it's the only affordable place to eat inside the Cosmo! The pizza itself is decent depending on what you get. I got 2 slices: pepperoni and sausage/banana pepper. The pepperoni one was alright...I've definitely had better at cheaper price points. the sausage and banana pepper one was pretty damn good though and it was a good combo together. I'd come back for that one.. . Slices range around the price of 5 bucks each depending on what kind you get. Cheese slices are under $5, while ones with tons of toppings will push the price closer to $6. Whole pies are around $26-30 and may be a cheaper option if you're wanting more than 4 slices. Drink selection is sparse here, and bottled beer is 8 bucks! I guess it is the Strip though...They had a water cooler there but it was broken. Thanks for putting a sign on there to let us know because a few customers and I tried messing with it and wondered why nothing would dispense. . . I would come back here but only if I were already near the Cosmo. It's definitely not worth the drive down. I'd much rather drive to Metro Pizza or Costco for cheaper and more tasty pies.
I'm glad I found this little secret place from a little someone ;) the pizzas are remarkably similar to NYC pizza... I would say even better. Rich cheese, white sauce, and the best crust in Vegas. You have to try it when you get the chance after a few drinks and a spontaneous Vegas night with friends. Good luck finding it.
Unbelievable pizza. Some of the best I've had. Definitely try to white pizza and the pepperoni was to die for.
