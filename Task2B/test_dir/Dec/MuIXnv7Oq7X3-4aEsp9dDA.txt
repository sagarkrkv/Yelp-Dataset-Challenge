Citizen Public House is an upscale, modern American restaurant where you can find plenty of unique dishes and a signature salad with its own Facebook site.. . My Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return). . Atmosphere - We checked out Citizen Public House on a week night, but it was still busy.  Lights will be dim, noise will be loud, but everything around you is modern.  If you're looking for a quiet place, Citizen Public House is not it.  But if you're ok with the high energy and noise you'll love it.. . Service - Our server was better than great.  He was very accommodating.   We made reservations over the phone for a large party, and he secured a semi-private room for us and let us put in several appetizer orders ahead of time.  Throughout the meal the entire team went above & beyond, making sure we were ok, talking about our love of food, and making sure our experience would be perfect.  1 Star.. . Food - The appetizers rule at Citizen Public House.  I think it's ridiculous that a SALAD has its own Facebook page.  Then I ate it.  It was ridiculously good.  The presentation itself is great, and once the servers mix it together, it becomes a fresh, modern, texture packed bite.  I will admit I doubted it but now I'm a believer. Bacon fat popcorn.  Yes.  It was even great the next day.  Pork Belly Pastrami - tender, well-seasoned, and could have been my main meal.  Which is funny because looking back, I enjoyed all the appetizers a lot more than the main courses.  The scallops were good and my short rib was not as tender as I would have liked, but after our appetizer fest it really didn't matter.  Bottom line is the pre-meal is where I'll put my money in the future.  1  1/2 Star.. . Will I Return? - For the apps!  Not sure the main courses are worth it for a return visit, but I would come back and order the same delicious starters as I did that night.  Now, Citizen Public House is not cheap, so that's all I would be able to afford.   1/2 Star.. . My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):. 1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.. 1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.. 2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.. 1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. . . Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.
Amazing! I was with a group of six and we tried many dishes.  From the bacon popcorn to the drink service, we were delighted every step of the way. The place is a bit loud but that was perfect for us on a Friday night.
Fantastic service.   Great variety in menu.  Thai margarita to die for.  Hummus good, macaroni and cheese good,  grilled cheese super yummy.  This place lives up to its great yelp reviews.  Prices medium to low in my opinion.  Would go back for sure!
The ambience was very trendy and relaxing. This being our first time there, we let our very exuberant waiter tell us his favorites. He was a fountain of information and did a wonderful job explaining the whole menu. He recommended the tossed salad as an appetizer and it was a great mixture of texture and taste that was refreshing. I chose the meatloaf entree and yes you may think it is just a home style classic but this meatloaf was elevated in taste and the zucchini was cooked perfectly (wish I had gotten more than three slices, but succulent each of them). I was stuffed but when the desserts were explained to me, I could not resist and ordered a the trifecta dessert that included fudge, strawberry ice cream and brittle. Delicious! This was a great find in Scottsdale that was pretty close to our hotel. Bonus!
As first I was skeptical... But mad I haven't been a fan longer!. . Chopped salad, pastrami pork belly, kilt lifter fondue and scallops what was for dinner!. . I don't even like scallops and I thought they were okay! My fiance sure did love them, he said the best he has had since City Hall. The chopped salad is a must do-- see my tip!! . . AJ was our sever and he had his hands full of tables. He must be the most friendliest server I have had. He was very engaging with us and the rest of his tables. He even sent us home with a dessert! I know I will request him next time we dine here.. . I love the lighting in this restaurant too , very romantic and calm.  Great place !
My husband Matt B. and I met our friend Stef P. for dinner one night in Scottsdale, at Citizen Public House. We'd just flown into town and were looking forward to an easy gastropub dinner. The place was not at all what we expected. It was less gastropub than full-on upscale sit-down restaurant, with entrees creeping into the $30 range. Thankfully, we ended up loving the place.. . Citizen Public House is in cozy Old Town Scottsdale, and it was vibrant and charming on a Friday night. We had a late reservation (9:15) and the place was still pretty busy. I liked the atmosphere--it was nice, but informal. We hadn't seen Stef in four years, and had a great time catching up over dinner. Service was excellent. Our waiter Brad was on top of his game.. . We had a couple rounds of drinks, andI really enjoyed the cocktails. The Im-Port was particularly good, a smokey drink made with Jameson, Tawny Port, tobacco bitters, and Guinness foam, served on the rocks with a smoked sugar rim. The Thai Margarita was pleasant, too, a mix of Patron silver with galangal and kaffir lime simple syrup, tamarind reduction, Thai chili sea salt, basil, and lime, served on the rocks. It tasted more like a straight margarita than I thought it would, but I liked it. I also had a sample of the barrel-aged Craftsman, made with Jameson, Cocchi Americano, and Charbay green tea apertif. (Brad brought it over because I was waffling between the Im-Port and the Craftsman, and he gave me a free taste after I'd already decided on the Im-Port.) It was pretty great, smooth and boozy with a definite sweetness. Probably would've gotten it if I wanted a third drink. Matt tried one of the other barrel-aged cocktails, the Boulvardier [sic?] made with Maker's 46 bourbon, Campari, and sweet vermouth. Another solid drink.. . The food was fantastic. The three of us shared the pork belly pastrami and an order of Bernie's mac 'n cheese, which worked as both appetizer and side. The pork belly pastrami seems to be Citizen Public House's signature dish, and it's a great one. Pork belly came pastrami-cured and spiced, with rye spaetzle, brussels sprout sauerkraut, and mustard jus. The pork was juicy, fatty, and intensely flavorful, and I loved all of the sides. It wouldn't be right to come here without trying this dish. The mac 'n cheese was also delicious, made with curly cavatappi pasta in a gorgonzola and emmental cheese sauce, with a chilled tomato relish on top. The pasta was cooked al dente and I loved the sharp cheeses and the spicy tomato relish. The portion was huge. We split it three ways and still had leftovers.. . I had the pan-seared scallops for my entree, while Matt and Stef had the fair trade short ribs. Both were excellent. The scallops were plump and beautifully cooked, served with Hampshire belly bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens, and a cola gastrique. There was so much great flavor and texture on this plate. It was exactly what I wanted. The short ribs were another winner, a giant plate of tender coffee-rubbed ribs with dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree, and seasonal vegetables.. . We ended up spending more than we meant to at Citizen Public House, but we were on vacation and had a truly lovely meal. I'd recommend this place for a nice dinner out in Scottsdale, to locals and tourists alike.
Citizen Public House is a gastropub in the Old Town Scottsdale that has vibrant local community feel.. . Food was excellent:. . - Shrimp and tomato salad. - Amaro meatloaf. . Both dishes were simple, but execution made the difference.
Chopped salad was the absolute best!
Fun and knowledgeable bar staff. Had bacon popcorn. Fantastic!! Excellent happy hour with half price drafts and great appetizers.
Pork Belly Pastrami - excellent. Chopped Salad - unique. Smoked Duck Breast - delicious. Bread Pudding - fantastic. . Excellent all around.
My new favorite spot to eat and drink! Excellent service and the food is phenomenal! I come here at least twice a week now and have tried almost everything. Highly recommended!
Citizen Public House is a great laid-back restaurant with good atmosphere and fantastic food.  I've eaten there twice in the last year, and I've been very impressed with the service and the quality of the food both times.
I loved this place. The bacon popcorn and chop salad are money. I am glad I made a reservation, there was a two hour wait on Friday night for a table.
This place was AMAZING!  Went there for a work holiday party and it was great.  Gary our waiter made our choices even tougher as he expertly explained all the dishes.  You MUST get the smoked salmon chopped salad, it is worth all of the accolades it receives.  Also tried the pork belly pastrami and it was excellent.  Between us we covered all the main dishes and there was much being shared as everything was top notch.  Will be back again & again & again!!!
The appetizers were amazing. Service was excellent. The original chopped salad is truly amazing. Nothing like it! We also had the Burrata and it was excellent. Ditto for the curry bisque...  slight kick and totally delicious. The drinks were good... but a little over hyped. For an entree our server recommended the scallops but we decided to split the meatloaf... we probably should have listened to our server... stay away from the meatloaf. Honestly it was amazingly ordinary given how excellent the appetizers, salad and soup were.  All in all, a great choice. Definitely would recommend. Thanks's Yelp!
Hands down, this is the best restaurant in downtown Scottsdale. During multiple visits in the past few weeks, we tried a variety of appetizers and main courses. Every dish was delicious and the service is always good. Our favorite is the scallop entree which was cooked to perfection and seasoned delicately. This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.
The original chopped salad is the best thing I ate my entire trip to Scottsdale/best salad I've ever had! A must order!
Came here with my family that drove into town from SoCal for Xmas. Was looking to take them to a nice place for xmas-eve dinner and read positive reviews about this place.. . We ordered many small dishes and 2 entrees to share: Pork belly pastrami, shrimp tomatosalad, burrata, crispy chicken gizzards, amaro meatloaf, and pan-seared scallops. The waitress also recommended the famous chopped salad and boy.... was that the best decision and dish of the night! Every one of the dishes were tasty with the 2 best dishes being the 2 salads.. . I'll definitely come back to Citizen Public House in the future. Once again.. that chopped salad.... must try!
I attended a meeting here, first visit ever. This place was great. I was able to try multiple Appetizers including the bruschetta, steak skewer, and crab cake. All delicious. Then I tried their signature chop salad and I highly recommend it. For dinner I had the filet mignon which came with potatoes and a veggies.... Yumo... The other attendees ordered both scallops and the buttermilk chicken... All looked amazing. The dessert was nothing to brag about and def. not their strong suit. I had cypress Chardonnay (wow) and their coffee wAs amazing. I will def be back. They aren't cheap but the good was worth it...
Great drinks, great atmosphere. The menu was eclectic comfort food. Our server Ajay was awesome. Enjoyed it all.
Matt was our server and he was great. Great service. He was friendly and pretty dang knowledgeable. He noticed my baseball cap is from baltimore and immediately guessed I was from Maryland. Anyways, the food was fantastic too. We actually were not there to drink any alcohol and had seen the reviews for the food. I got the lamb burger and my wife the grilled cheese. It was great. I highly rate the food here. Can't say anything about the drinks.
Visited this restaurant on a busy Monday night, it was packed and lively. We didn't have a reservation, and were told that it would be a 40 min wait, but we took a chance and hung out at the bar; we ended up seated at a table within 15 minutes. Our server Matt was very knowledgeable and friendly. We tried the delicious hand-chopped salad and the rosemary roasted nuts for starters, then enjoyed the short ribs and buttermilk chicken as our entrees. Matt was very patient with us, as we had a little trouble deciding on appetizers. We initially requested the pork belly pastrami, but changed our minds. Matt brought us the pastrami anyway and we tried it on the house - it was wonderful! The restaurant is a classy upscale place with soft lighting and hipster patrons; great environment but probably a little too loud for quiet conversation. We will definitely make time to come back here on our next trip Scottsdale!
I wasn't too excited to come here, since coming to Arizona I expected to be eating Mexican food. Now I'm sad this gastropub isn't on the East Coast. I forget the name of our waiter, but he was very friendly and extremely tall. . . The food was delicious. Here's a rundown.. . Appetizers:. The Original Chopped Salad (corn, couscous, smoked salmon, asiago, pepitas, tomatoes, arugula, currants, buttermilk pesto dressing) - Despite all the raving reviews, I was reallyskeptical on how good a salad would be. Damn it was good. The textures were party-in-my mouth good. The buttermilk pesto dressing gave it a perfect tang. Do yourself a favor and order this above anything else. https://www.facebook.com/TheOriginalChoppedSalad/. . Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut, mustard jus) - The pork belly was melt in your mouth, although some off-putting parts were all fat. The brussel sprouts were shaved leaves. I was confused by the rye spaetzle. Couldn't tell if it was meat or not, but overall the flavors of this dish are good.. . Chia Seared Tuna (Thai purple sticky rice, asparagus puree, fried leek & micro green salad) - This dish was a bit bland overall. Both the puree and tuna had no flavor, but the purple rice provided a good contrast of texture. I love purple rice in general though.. . Crispy Chicken Gizzards (pickled lemon, garlic yogurt, shiso)- The gizzards were dry, made a little bit better with the sauce. A little lackluster compared to the other appetizers.. . Entrees:. Tender Belly Pork Chop (dried apricot sorghum, shaved cantaloupe and asparagus salad with pink peppercorn vinaigrette) - This is on the pricey end, but definitely get this for entree. We ordered this medium and it turned out very juicy and well marinated. Good pork flavor. The quinoa provide nice contrast of texture and dried apricots provide extra sweetness.. . Fair Trade Short Rib (coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg) - I also recommend this for an entree, despite being pricey. So tender and the flavor was delicious. The bed of mashed turnips was a good combo. The tangy sauce is an explosion of flavor when it hits your tongue.. . Yum Neau Wrap (grilled beef tenderloin, watercress, cucumber, mint, cilantro, yuzu vinaigrette, Thai eggplant & pickled cabbage slaw) - This was so overpoweringly salty. I could not taste anything it was wrapped with. The best part of this dish was the pickled vegetables, but overall I would not recommend ordering this.. . Desserts:. Pig in the Orchard (Apple bread pudding, bacon, brown butter ice cream) - This was recommended by our waiter as his favorite. Good recommendation by him, because this made dessert my favorite part of the night. The bread was so soft. Not sure I could taste the bacon This is a must get dessert. . Cocoa Jar (chocolate coffee pudding, crispy rice crumble, whipped cream, cocoa cookies)- Not a big fan of cream, but everyone else in my family loved it. liked the cookie crumble on top and the cocoa cookies. There is a cookie/brownie at the bottom of the jar. Make sure you dig into the layers to get every layer in a bite to bring it all together.. . Dim Lighting, fantastic food. Extremely popular so make a reservation if you can. I will definitely miss that Chopped Salad very much.
