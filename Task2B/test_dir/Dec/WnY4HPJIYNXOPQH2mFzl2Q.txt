Great hotel to visit, When I visit the strip I always stay here. the hotel is amazing with great staff and a killer day party scene and nightlife. It is always a fun place to gamble even though most of the time I louse lol. I recommend this place all the time to my friends and fam.
Just spent a December weekend here with my wife. The Hotel At Mandalay Bay location is ideal for walking: close to Times Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Centre. The bar area is happy and comfy place. Elevator service was terrible; long lineups waiting for cars that seemed be be 'stuck' much of the time; they MUST do something about that. At a time when wi-fi is free at so many locations, I believe their policy of charging is outrageous, especially given the price of a hotel room. Would still return, but they have to make some changes.
My friend and I booked The Hotel At Mandalay Bay on Priceline for $116 a night . After reading some of the reviews I have to admit I was a little nervous. The room we booked was called a cozy queen room . When we checked in they had a king room reserved for us . The room looked exactly like the picture . The location of the hotel was wonderful. And the little cafe in the lobby had Starbucks coffee which made me very happy . Grand Central is a block away and is awesome ! I would definitely stay there again !
