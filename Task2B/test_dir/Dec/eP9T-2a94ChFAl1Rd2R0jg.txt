The Trump is AWESOME!. . I am a born and raised Las Vegas Native. Now that I live outside of the state, this is the only place I stay when I come into town. My last trip to the strip was in March for my 22nd birthday and Spring Break. I went with some college friends and we absolutely loved our stay!. . There are magnificent chandelier's hanging from the ceiling that greet you when you walk into the lobby making the lobby feel regal and ooze with classiness. For some of my friends who had never been to Las Vegas, this made us feel like we had arrived for the best Spring Break yet. Our room was spacious and beautiful with a great view! . . In addition to the beautiful interior design, the staff was excellent! Everyone was friendly and greeted us when we walked into the lobby, bar, pool area, etc. The customer service is through the roof and we felt extremely comfortable and well cared for. We went out to some of the top night clubs and either walked or took a taxi back to the hotel- The Distance isn't too far. We all loved the bathroom! With a bunch of girls getting ready to go out, the large mirrors and space made getting ready fun and enjoyable (rather than squishing for mirror space).. . I will recommned the Trump Hotel to anyone. We are already looking into booking again in the next couple months!
This hotel is far from the strip. You have to cab it to the strip. . . The hotel does offer a free shuttle service to the strip which is a plus. However, you have to wait in a line in order to take the shuttle which sucks. . . The hotel is right in front of a mall which is a plus. The hotel shopping includes very little. The hotel offers ivanka trump's items (of course). I have one of her clutches and its a high priced item with poor quality materials and generic handsmanship.. . The room we got was spacious and had lots of window. It has a pretty yet typical Vegas view. The room was fresh. . . I would have wanted a hotel closer to the strip but we wanted to be closer to the convention center. This hotel was a shorter cab ride to the convention center. It was a compromise we were willing to make. . . As far as the look of the hotel, it's definitely more traditional rather than the grand casino hotels surrounding the trump. . . If you want a casino decked with the typical Vegas flashy lights, it's not the trump.. . Lastly, their pools are very relaxing and quiet. I concluded it was because it was farther from the strip. So that's a plus!
The Trump offers a magnificent accomodation with  flat screen TV, beautiful spa tub, kitchen, 2nd bathroom (offered in suites) and full kitchen. The Trump is the way to go. . Get the Suite its well worth it.
We decided to travel to Las Vegas for New Years and for my birthday. The hotel is off the strip, just across the street from Fashion Mall and down the road from the Wynn Resort. It was amazing. We were greeted as soon as we got out of our car and a bell hop was right there getting our luggage and whisking us inside to check-in. Check-in was fast, courteous, and easy. Our room was on the 54th floor facing the strip. The view was AMAZING! The room was clean, quiet and enjoyable. It was a welcome calm place to come back to after the hectic strip scene. The best part was the New Years fireworks show. Nearing midnight, we went back to our room and watched the fireworks show over the strip from 5 hotel roof tops. Our view was amazing! We saw all of the fireworks (except for the Stratosphere which was behind the Trump) and had an uninterrupted view of the entire show. It is a fireworks show I'll always remember. Here is where the Trump really went above and beyond. After getting home, we realized we left our camera in the room with ALL of our pictures and video of the firework show. The Trump staff found our camera and shipped it back to us. We received it and it was in working order and all of our memories that we captured in film were saved! Thanks so much to the Trump staff for finding our camera, placing it in lost and found, then mailing it us when we called for it and supplied identifying information. GREAT, GREAT STAFF at the Trump Las Vegas! The next time we come to Vegas, we are DEFINITELY staying at the Trump again. No question about it.
Tis not the season to visit the Trump in Las Vegas. I get that December is considered the off season for Vegas, and that is why I gave this review two stars and not one.. . The staff mentally checks out around this time of year. The service at the bar, the lounge, restaurants, and even House keeping is horrible!  Every year the company I work for treats us to a Vegas weekend, and next year if we do stay at the Trump again, I will pass.. . It is one thing that they do not have a casino or live entertainment, but maybe they should make what they have work, and work well!! perhaps I am being harsh, but I am not the only one that is feeling this way.
This place is great for a business hotel or if you don't gamble and/or with the family.. . Big, comfortable, well appointed rooms.  Nice pool, decent bar and food.. . No casino, but a little walk to Caesar's.. . This is my detox hotel.  Usually I book a night or two here before staying on the strip.  Keeps the expenses down  LOL.
Can Never go wrong at the Trump Tower. My husband love staying at this hotel whenever we are in the city. The Bell service, Front desk, door man, and everything here is excellent. They are so friendly and very professional. The hotel it self is always polished and smoking free. Love the view from all of the rooms that we stayed so far. Beautiful room with a view of the strip itself and we can see all the night lights from our window. Love this place. Can't wait to come back soon.
One of the cleanest and best hotel I have stayed at ever! The room was clean, the staff friendly. Even the elevator was fast.
Stayed at this hotel quite a few times and loved it.  . . Very clean, away from the strip, so if you're looking for some quiet time. It's great.  . Has a nice view of the strip (if you're facing it that is) . Rooms are spacious and clean . The pool area is very relaxing. . Staff is very friendly and helpful. . . Took off a star for . 1- there's a train that passes through here and blows its horn.  So if you're a light sleeper you might hear it. . 2- away from the strip.  So if you're out to steakhouses or clubs and need to get back you have to cab it . 3- they offer a shuttle, but the lines can get quite long.  . 3- the shuttle only takes you to Wynn , which you can walk to. And Caesars palace.  Which is a ride away.  The shuttle runs every 7-10 mins.
Last week I decided to visit Las Vegas with my wife for the first time. Looked at hotels on line and amongst the choices that stood out was the trump international , so we arrived and service was great at the counter. Went up stairs and opened the door and we said yea looks nice , looked at the window and we had a nice view. The reason why I am giving them a 2 stars not more is because the room and shower door wasn't clean, I have pictures , the night stands bottom shelves were super dusty. As well as the desk. In the shower , the door hinge was black , for the money I paid I could of been to perhaps a cleaner hotel with a lot more comfortable mattress too.
The experience was good. I would have given a 4 star, the room are spacious and the hotel is conveniently located acrosss the Fashion Mall. The shuttle to the Ceasars and to the Wynn is a plus, I just wished they would rotate every 20 minutes. However watch out for the hidden fees of $25 per day and the $100 withold taken as a deposit. When you sum all this charges and deposits it does not make it any difference than a stay at the Bellagio but without all the amenities the Bellagio has to offer.
I chose to stay at the Trump because I was told that there wasn't a casino inside and it was more like a normal none Vegas hotel. Since I'm not a gambler and am not a fan of the over all casino vibe I really liked that.. All staff were great. They only have valet, which I appreciated.. The lobby and over all feel of the hotel was classy and upscale. It seemed like an oasis within Las Vegas.. The rooms were nice and very large with a mini kitchen and large bathroom and tub. Each room had a mini porch which have it a home feel.. I don't think I'll stay anywhere else next time I'm in LV.
I guess I am a lite sleeper. Ugh. There is a train the rolls through the middle of the night - it woke me up and kept me up. Such a bummer. . . Pros: . Staff. easy valet . easy walk to Wynn, and the mall . no cigarettes! . lovely bathrooms . . Cons:. middle of the night noise . . Things of note: . Very flowery toiletries . Comfortable bed, but sheets are due for replacement . Hand operated shades . Fast elevators!. Good wifi!
Pros:. - no casino = no smoke smell. - clean. - calm atmosphere. - nice and huge bathtub . . Cons:. - tv, stove, and coffee machine were broken . - room service didn't knock before entering . - far from strip. - food service is slow and forgot to bring us utensils (we never got them). - pillows smelled like sweat. - didn't replenish the tea packets. - wifi is really slow
Every thing was great... one of the nicest 5 star properties without the casino crowd. Close enough to the strip.
Trump Hotel only has valet parking - no self parking.  Good luck waiting in lines for your car - not only loads of waiting time, we witnessed several near misses of valet staff and patrons!  . . After shelling out $300/night for a suite for four adults, we found a pull out couch with a mattress of the cheapest quality I've ever seen.  Wires protrude with seemingly NO padding whatsoever.  It was absolutely unusable - my son had to sleep on the floor. . . Shuttle service ends at 11pm in a city where most stay out past midnight.  . Staff possessed very large egos and patronizing tones - no customer service whatsoever.. . We will NEVER be back.  . We're taking our business to Wynn!
Stayed here twice both times tv had major digital breakup(unwatchable) no casino attached which can be good or bad wifi sucks balls. Big balls.
Loved the room!!  So spacious and pretty.  The bathroom was luxurious.  The staff was very friendly and they have a free shuttle to the Wynn and Caesars Palace.  That makes up for the hotel being so far from the strip.  I liked that they had a microwave and a coffee maker.  I would definitely stay here again.
I'm in Vegas a lot for work -- not to party, so finding a QUIET, mature hotel to stay in is a relief. I've stayed at the party hotels and drunks knocking on my door at 3am because they are lost is something I can do without. The Trump, on the other hand, is great for extended business stays. Their rooms come complete with a kitchen so you can stock your own refrigerator and cook "at home" if you wish. They also provide FREE bottled water daily -- not like the other hotels that criminally charge you $7+ if you dare drink the bottles they leave in your room. I signed up for Trump Card membership and the extra details/customizing of my room on every stay is great. Any time I've ever had an issue with a room, management has been more than accommodating at fixing it or giving me a better room. I pretty much don't stay anywhere else in Vegas unless I have to. Good job Trump!
I loved staying here! I was in Vegas for business, so staying at a hotel without all the distractions was great.. . If you want a place to party or have fun, this may not be the best place. If you want a luxurious hotel with amazing rooms, amazing service, and none of the hassles that come with being in Vegas for business... this place is perfect.. . I have stayed at 3 other 5 star hotels in Vegas and my room here was my favorite.. . I will definitely come again.
Some of the reviews on Trump Las Vegas crack me up with the exaggerations and dashed expectations.. . Is it worthy of five stars? Heck yes! No doubt. And it's a great value. I've never priced it and found a large suite for less than $100. Do they charge a resort fee? YES! Just like everyone else on the strip. Is it spelled out to you before you sign anything? YES - In big print. And if you know about it and complain about it - what are you doing in a five star resort anyway?. . To the good stuff!. . Trump was built as a luxury condominium thus it is unique compared to other wonderful resort/CASINO'S like The Palazzo. Trump is quiet and understated. The suites are decorated in a modern but comfortable motif and include at the bare minimum a kitchenette with imported designer appliances. The beds are HEAVEN too. I found the service to be exceptional and my suite was always spotless when I returned from lunch and shopping. The staff here is what you would expect from a Trump property. Refined, sort of out of sight, but always accommodating.. . The bathroom was AWESOME, especially the HDTV built into the mirror.. . If you are looking for a pampering yet private escape Trump Las Vegas is your place. I went to rest after a little cosmetic surgery and it was so quite and peaceful you could hear a pin drop. But plastic surgeons always recommend a few hours of gaming each night to reduce the bruising and enhance healing. Like any resort in Las Vegas you have to walk to get to a casino or somewhere good to eat. Or drive yourself, rent a taxi, or use a shuttle. And for snacks you have a kitchen or you can walk to Fashion Show Mall directly across the street.. . Lastly - I was on one of the highest floors with a magnificent strip view at no extra cost probably because it was not crowded and money talks. But in any case I DID NOT hear train noises and you would hear a train even 60 floors up. The soundproofing is fine. I also did not hear a peep from the neighbors next door.. . And the valet staff was excellent!. . My only suggestion to improve this resort would be to spruce up the lobby area a bit. It needs some color or perhaps a chic water-wall. And turn on some music or something so the lobby is inviting and welcoming. It was a bit "cold" but that's just my two cents.. . Room Tip: High floor of course. Rent a car but remember there is only valet parking.
