I was introduced to Ichiza from others that were on the Ichiza hype and it's pretty good... when you can actually get a table....  I would recommend making a reservation even though you may have difficulty getting anyone to answer. We went late Sunday night at 9:30pm thinking that we would avoid the crowds but the wait was 1.5 hours long. I would normally understand but not so much when I see through the window and notice that a few tables were empty and no one was being seated at them. The hostess were turning guests away.  Parking in the plaza is crazy. Good food but go earlier in the evening or on the weekdays.
My last night in vegas. Ethan and I went to this place for eating after a shopping day and O theater show in Bellagio, super late around 1am. It is in second floor. It's hard to see from the outside. It is a small place but got quite a lot selection of food.. . We order the broiled whole squid which is ok, not good as I expected. The yellowtail sashimi is really good, fresh and tasty. Ethan had the ramen deluxe and beef bowl which are ok. The beef tongue yakitori tastes good and tender. Well, I mean for the food,I don't think it's surprising, I had sth much better in NYC, but for the price, I will go here next time. It's cheap and worth try. Seriously, they get tons of food u can choose. I will try sth else next time and maybe I will find excited food there. I believe their food are good.
The wife and I dropped by for dinner.  It was crowded as all seats were taken.  We were able to score 2 seats at the community table.  Service was pretty good.  We were able to order all of our food in a few minutes.  The food was tasty.  Portions are the correct size as well.
So far I have been there 4 time, I like everything I had and the service is always great. I think when you have the real Japanese server, they are different than any other Asian country, they are always so sweet and attentive. . I love they have so many special postedeverywhere on the wall, but it does take a while to try to see what they actually really have, maybe my eye sight isn't as good, and also I don't read Japanese. Still worthy to try to look up the special. Last night I try the grill whole squid, delicious. Steam egg custard in tea cup was always my favorite Japanese treat, they did steam well, but it was a bit watery. Salmon sashimi was steal, $7 dollar for 5 fresh pieces. Grilled skewer is recommend as well. . Overall I would suggested to give a try, they open late night so if you want to avoid the wait and hungry in the middle of the night, great choice!
Food looked bomb but it wasn't even that good.. The Red Snapper Carpaccio wasn't fresh, I was really disappointed. I'd say Raku is way better.
Felt like staying in for one of my nights in Vegas. Picked up some food to go from Ichiza so that I can enjoy some nom noms while lounging in front of the TV or from the balcony at the hotel room. . . I picked up some: . . * tsuku - chicken meat balls. * sabamiso - mackarel with miso marinated. * kan - beef tongue. * kakiagi - eel roll. * ramen dx. * shrimp tempura bowl. . Loved it all! They packaged it well to stay fresh and enjoyed the same as if ordered for dine in. Dine in also includes more food options -- just check out the specials they have posted on the walls. Worth a trip off the strip.
Great for facilitating a group of hungry asians. I wish I could tell you what I ate but there was so much stuff and I didnt get to take a picture of it all. I remember agadashi tofu because no one else at the table ate it except me (I had 3 servings, it was good!) and the eel roll with tempura'd vegetables on top with eel sauce. It's one of the specials on the wall. Really good!. . Their honey toast dessert is a lot bigger than you think and see from the pictures. Make sure you share!
This place is good for trying a bit of everything of Japanese cuisine, especially since the pricing is good. I'd come here if you want to try experimenting with other types of Japanese food. Every Japanese restaurant has ramen or some sort of rice bowl. You come here to try the other side of Japanese food because most likely they'll have it somewhere on their menu. If you don't see it you can always ask them and see if they can make it- which is why I love this place.. . When you come at night, the ambiance is very authentic to a japanese izakaya (which is like a tapas place). It's busy, it's loud, an all Japanese speaking staff, and then there's the overwhelming amount of menus all over the walls. It reminded me very much of Japan! (For the record, I used to live in Japan.) It's a fun place to bring your friends, drink a few beers, and order a little bit of everything.. . Lunch time is my favorite time to come eat here. Service and the food is always good. . They even have lunch specials in which you get a choice between 2 chef choice meals or you can order a bento box type meal.. . Service during busy weekend nights can be iffy. Sometimes can be inattentive but not always the case. Reason why I gave 4 star and not 5. If I could, I'd rate a solid 4.5. . Recommendations: Daily specials are usually promising, Ramen Dx, yakisoba, honey toast, and if you're daring takowasa (raw octopus in wasabi). . Tips:. -Make a reservation 2 hours beforehand. - parking on the weekends is horrible, come early to your reservation.  -sign up with them for their membership you get 5% every $20 purchase and when the stamp card is filled you get 10% every visit.
I'm a sushi lover so I came here to check out their selection. Their menu has a variety of items which is nice.. . I ordered their Tom yum roll and uni in a lemon. It was very fresh and different. The Tom yum roll came in a spring roll wrap and was flavorful and the uni was good. . . Their prices were a little high for being off the strip, but still good quality food.
It's decent. Honey toast is Bomb af the hot green tea is bomb af. . All the sushi... Ehhhh not so much. . Let's just say the sushi smells. Very. Very.  Fishy. Lol. Usually. Sushi isn't suppose to smell bad. But I guess if u can handle it, go for it.
  
Great food, small plates, well prepared and did I mention delicious? Definitely a great spot, off the strip jewel that you must visit.
I like this place! Its not the best Japanese joint in town but its top 10.....maybe 5. Specific Food items are authentic per my friends from Japan. Restaurant is open late and service is usually good. Pricing is not bad at all. Their Japanese apple curry, hamachi kana, and their chicken karaage are fantastic. Location to strip is nice and plenty of parking in back of strip mall if usual crowded front has no parking. The layout of the place is very authentic. Go check this place out!
This is my go-to restaurant whenever I'm in Vegas. The miso cod and the honey toast are a must. The rest is really personal preference. My girlfriend always goes with the hamachi which is decent. Sometimes you have to share the big table if it's crowded but it's a good price point for the quality of food.
