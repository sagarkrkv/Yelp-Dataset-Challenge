I checked in on 2pm, and they still charge me early check in fee, really? WTF! And the room was very old. I wont come again, this hotel is shit.
I always enjoy my time here. Even though I live in Vegas, I like to do mini "staycations". Recently stayed at the hotel and loved our room! Very charming French chabby chic decor. Great hotel room service, fast friendly and I love the ambience of the entire casino. Really does make you feel like your in Paris!
I'm not one to write a bad review... But I was treated like a f*ckin second class citizen tonight. To the server who refused to give me water, F*CK YOU! You chose to serve everyone else, but me... And I'm assuming because I wasn't the type of race you'd like to serve. You straight up told me I can't have bottle of water, but yet you chose to serve very white person in the casino. You're part of the reason why this nation is a million steps backwards! Good luck b*tch! Don't let me cross you again.
I expected better. We were very itchy sleeping on the bed, the pillows gave me a stuffy nose, may be this room was not occupied for a long time, I dont know how so much dust accumulated on some of the furniture. The AC would cool the room only if I set the temperature to like 68f the room was too hot when I set the temperature at 74.
Two words: resort fees.. . While the Paris is generally a nice looking hotel with decent rooms, they tacked on this suspicious "resort fee" to my last bill after I had already paid the initial bill. Essentially, in addition to the rate that they charge for the room, they charged me an extra $25/night to pay for amenities that I never used or asked for (eg: wireless, spa, etc.).. . Apparently, resort fees are a growing practice these days, and it's despicable that the Paris participates in this. I would much prefer that they simply folded this fee into the final room price instead of being dishonest about the real cost of lodging there.
Stayed here for the weekend. Excellent location as it is right in the middle of the strip.  Easy to navigate casino, easy to get to rooms. Neat  atmosphere in the shopping and dining areas within casino with the feel of being on the streets of France.  . . Got there to check in and our "reserved" king room was not available and all we could get was a queen.  Huh?  "Reserved" means what?  We were told that maybe on Saturday we could move to a queen. So first night we spent in the queen room along with dried blood on the comforter. Yes, really. . . Next night we moved to the king room and not much better. I went to move the night stand to plug in my iPhone and there was a dirty fork with food still on it!!!!! F-ing gross!. . $24 per night for resort fee which includes wifi - no it doesn't.  Wifi SUCKS. So slow it's safe to say it doesn't work. Called the front desk, transferred to tech support to ask can I pay for better speed?  "Sorry it is not available ".   Wow, what century do we live in?   This is unacceptable at a resort like this that charges $250+ per night. . . So we tried this place as something "nice" vs. the cheaper places around and ended up grossed out.   . . Yuck.
I'm a fan of this hotel in Vegas.  Notonly does it house my fav restaurant Mon Ami Gabi but, it also has great decor.  I love feeling like I'm being transported to a miniature Paris France.  Lots of French inspired food and shopping inside and it's even complete with it's very own Eiffel Tower!  Stop in here for a great dinner at the restaurant mentioned before and take a cool hipster shot out by the Eiffel Tower once you're done!
this review is on the casino grounds & parking lot, casino, total rewards desk (customer service), Eiffel Tower observation deck, and bathroom near the total rewards desk.. . A good-sized casino with carpet and cobblestone floors (neat, if you're wearing flats or athletic shoes, not so much if you're in heels or boots). It's a fair amount of walking from the garage to the heart of the casino. We saw lots of restaurants and little shops along the way. Busy crowd but not jam-packed when we visited sunday afternoon.. . I had my husband sign up for the Total Rewards Card since entry to the Eiffel Tower on my birthday was free (sunday), so was our son (no strollers BTW), and after all the taxes & fees, paid $16.00. Not bad, since two of us were free (it does cost more during the evening). The tickets are in the gift shop. Take the escalator. Then, you take pictures which you can view later on. This was our 1st time there as a family. (The last time was on our 1st date, in 2004.) The elevator was a minute and 17 seconds, according the to the attendant. Nice views during the day, with little rectangular cutouts at certain vistas, so you don't get the fence railing. . . While my husband was in line (was a busy line), we went to the bathroom (there was no visible changing station and the only handicapped bathroom was occupied, so yes, I changed him standing up (but I'm starting to get used to that!) The sinks are so pretty, floral porcelain (I don't think I've ever seen that in a casino). . . It was sunday and lots of employees were wearing their football jerseys, including the cocktail waitresses. . . Once you are outside the property, it's walking distance to the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops, which you guessed, was our next stop.   . . It'd been a long while since we were at this property.  Overall, it's very nice. Not that smokey, either.
Very nice hotel..Nice staff specially in  valet parking.. there are a lot of restaurant and Cafe inside the hotel. the price is good and the best thing is the hotel is right on strip and you don't need to drive a lot :)
We booked this hotel for my sisters bachelorette weekend and the price made it so attractive. I must say I dont regret choosing this hotel. Not only was it elegant, but the pool bar area, casino and multiple main floor bars had a great environment and energy. The rooms were clean, comfortably bed (especially after walking the strip!) and elegance, although who are we kidding...we were hardly there! I also loved the view of the eiffel tower from the entrance and from the pool (it was this eiffel tower and the map that helped us locate the hotel again). This hotel has a great location right on the strip and close to Cabo wabo, and other attractions. Now that I am recently engaged,  I am considering a las vegas bachelorette... just because it was THAT fun ! And will probably be staying at this hotel !!
This review is for Housekeeping and Lost and Found.  Thank you all for being so honest and helpful.  We stayed at the hotel in November and I left my favorite jacket in the hotel room closet upon check out, and didn't realize it until over 2 weeks later when I went into my own closet looking for it.  My heart sank.  I quickly called the hotel hoping they'd have it.  They connected me to Lost and Found where I had to leave a message describing the jacket.  Minutes later they called back saying they have it and would FedEx it to me!  It got here 2 days later!  Thank you everyone, I so appreciate it! Not everyone is as helpful or honest, but you people are and deserve to be recognized for it!  Thank you again!!
There are things I like and do not like about Paris. The rooms are spacious and clean, and the bed was comfortable. Unfortunately our TV went out, our toilet had plumbing issues, and our clip on shower curtain felt a bit cheap. It also takes about 5 minutes to reach anyone by phone at the front desk, and the check in/out process takes about 30 minutes each time. There is a $25/day resort fee.. . As for the casino they definitely could use friendlier staff in the bar. Maybe they were trying to mimic the French attitude? On the contrary their convenience store clerk was very helpful. I'll probably try to stay elsewhere next time.
Paris Hotel is in a great location on the strip and they have beautiful rooms, but only if you upgrade.  I am a total rewards member and usually get free rooms at most of the "lower grade" hotels that they own.  I have stayed at Paris several time and have loved the place.  . . Last time I stayed there (my wife's choice) we went up to our room expecting a great experience.  Well we were disappointed.  The room felt like we were staying at the Harris Hotel, except we paid 4X as much money.  There were rips in the carpet and food still left in the mini fridge from the people prior to us.. . I called the front desk to complain and they upgraded our room for us.  The service is excellent here, but just don't expect a beautiful room, unless you pay extra.. . On a plus note.... go to the buffet for breakfast.... it is great!
Every Strip hotel has a "resort fee", but this is ridiculous. It's basically $20 for Internet... yet it only includes 1 device. Connect your phone, iPad, or any of the tech stack most people carry around these days, and it's an extra $14.99 *per device* - just a few gadgets = more than the cost of the room! No other hotel I stayed anywhere in Vegas was this restrictive.. . Got a $25 daily dining credit which seemed generous, but the restaurants were borderline awful - and prices were inflated at least 2x vs any comparative quality you could find elsewhere to compensate for any generosity.. . On the plus side, it's right in the middle of the strip, so pretty convenient to walk to other nearby resorts. That's about it.
i am giving this hotel 3 stars because although the outside is very nice including the restrooms.it is very. dissapointing that the rooms are not up tothe standards that they apparently want to reflect on the outside of the property.from a previous hotel owner i have noticed details that the management is not catching.when we checked in we noticed a chair that had graffiti which should have been taken out of the room before any guest checked in.lamps that had no bulbs.the bottom of a toilet was very dirty.soda was splashed on the wall.carpet was dirty and torn.chairs were very worn and a room seat dipped in too much.there  was  no coffee maker in my room.apparently some get them and some don't.also the same with the mini bar.too many extra  charges for standard accommodations. this hotel does  have the potential for being a fine hotel if these things were taken care of.also i noticed the all around customer service at the  front desk and gift shops are  not very warm and helpful.there was alot of refering to other people and other departments for simple questions, passing on the buck.management not bending was when there was a problem and manamement was reluctent to show good faith by  compensating to make up for the situation.in some cases. not good public relations.this attitude is carried out into the gift shops as well.i asked a sales person to show me were a size was which i could not find and was not helped. is this a vegas thing or just bad employees? also , there are advertisements for jersey boy's giving military a special discount $99.00 for orchestra seating for 2.yet they do not know anything about this when asked at box office. lies, bad attitude and bad public relations at this hotel.
Paris Las Vegas, it is breathtaking. It is nothing short than what I had imagined. It's traditional Paris with a modern twist. Needless to say everything is pricey, after all it's a popular venue in Vegas. I like the restaurants inside the hotel, all the food I had was great.. What's not so great about the Paris is the many hidden charges. READ THE FINE PRINT! 5.00 additional to everything you order for room service, just because they bring it to your room. Remind you there is no option to pick it up yourself. Pricing is the same for two people but it goes up once you hit four, so big groups beware. I also wish the room had a microwave. I get it, traditional Paris but the 46" tv isn't traditional so where's my microwave? Nothing is complimentary, except ice. So if you forget your necessities you're better off going to a gas station. . The beauty of this hotel, it's connivence to the strip, and the helpful staff is why I give this place 3 stars.
We didn't stay for the rooms, but did enjoy the shops and dining experience. Beautiful decor and stunning architectural design. Will visit again.

My boyfriend and I stayed at the Paris hotel this past weekend for three nights. With resort fees and tax it came out to around $121 a night, which is pretty good in my opinion for a room on the strip. (The resort fees and tax are about $25 per day but include free wifi for two devices and access to the fitness center.) The check in process on Thursday night was a little slow (they only had three people at the concierge desk). The staff member who checked us in wasn't exactly friendly, apathetic I guess is the right word. He checked us in quickly and wasn't pushy about a room upgrade, which I appreciate. Our room was on the 5th floor but to our surprise it was a large corner room with two windows. We even had a view of the Bellagio fountains from our room. The room was clean and came with a mini-fridge which is awesome for keeping snacks and drinks cold. The bed was comfy and the tv had a nice selection of channels. The hotel is right in the middle of the strip and we liked the convenient location. We ate at the buffet for breakfast before our flight back to San Antonio and it was delicious. If given the same price I would definitely stay here again.
Quick stop at il central lobby lounge.... Awful service. Rude service. Huge roaches. . So gross.
I like the Paris! In terms of Total Reward casino-resorts, this seems to be at the higher end. Mon Ami Gabi is a delicious eatery (I am obsessed with their French onion soup) and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant is on my Vegas bucket list. I haven't stayed in the rooms, but the decor is very pretty (it's almost like New Orleans Square in Disneyland). Plus, you can get souvenir cups shaped like the Eiffel. Score.. . I enjoyed gambling here - special shoutout to Devon on the casino floor, who scanned my TR card promptly AND when I accidentally spilled my drink, was totally kind and forgiving. I really enjoy personable staff, and was impressed by how nice everyone was at Paris!
I stayed here for 4 days. First impression was horrible, I had to wait in line for about 25 mins to check in. There were only 3 receptionists at that time. I was ok with smoke coming from casino next to lobby, but my wife and my 2 year-old son could not stand for that.. . The room was not what I expected: small and old interior. Noisy refrigerator which made my sleep terrible.. . The location is great, it's just right on the Strip, convenient to go any where. The parking was big plus, similar to all other hotels in Vegas.
Bad attitude of the staff and very misleading people. . I was led to believe that i was paying extra for a room to get a view of the bellagio fountains but was given nothing. According to the front counter I was paying for a view of their swimming pool and eiffel tower. I was then told that I would have to pay another $44 per night for the view I wanted. I agreed to even that and so I walked all the way down with my bad knees and there was a different story.  . . Edith, Francisco and Mike at the front desk "knowing lied to me and made me go back and forth 3 times to different rooms promising me a better view each time. I came to the conclusion that they were just screwing around with me since the only other alternative was that they didn't know their property very well. Bad attitude and unprofessional customer service from Mike was the reason that I am putting down this bitter review. Had it not been for Mike I might have not taken the time to write down this account of my "BAD" experience with this Hotel.. . Now Since they managed to get me angry, here is more on the experience that I would have not mentioned otherwise.. . There was no coffee machine in my room and according to the housekeeping my premier room doesn't come with one...???  A first for me. So then I am left with 2 options either order a Liter of coffee for $12 plus extras, and have it delivered to my room, drink a cup and waste the rest  or walk all the way downstairs in my Pj's and get in line with other cranky people and  buy some. People need coffee when they wake up...... Unacceptable. I have never been to a hotel that doesn't have coffee in the room. A first for me. Maybe that is a Vegas thing. I don't know. I would have not mentioned this if it weren't for how I was treated by Mike.. . There were unsafe dangling electrical wires and extension chords hanging loose in the room. I am pretty sure that its against the fire code to have that. I posted pictures and I hope somebody does take care of it before there is a fire. Toddlers can easily access these and wrap those around their necks and get entangled, electric shock or choke.  Please fix this management? Las Vegas Fire Dept? Whatever the code enforcement agency in Nevada is?. . Totally Contradicting to the room description, the carpets in the room were ugly stained worn out and dirty. I have posted a picture to refer to.. . Also another very funny thing was that all the soap provided was smelling very feminine like flowers. Hello....? Men have to shower too. . Most men don't like to walk out of the shower smelling like a bouquet of feminine flowers lol.. . Stupid people. Choose neutral fragrances that both men and women can use. . . Wifi is only free for 2 devices. the third device is about $15.00 / day. Thats crazy. Again that might just be a vegas thing I don't know. . . I had never been to a motel before this. . . Now the thing to see is if this review gets any attention and what they care a damn to do something about atleast the loose electrical chords and Mike's ugly attitude.. . As far as I am concerned, I'm not going back to this place again.
The Paris Hotel and Casino is now the best representation of the Parisian neighborhood of Belleville, including the grime, dirt and the old prostitutes dressed like Britney Spears. Bring hand sanitizer.... . The place was run down, dirty and the hallways were disastrous. Doors with giant scuff marks and the smell of trash and old food every time you walked through them. The registration process was slow, with long lines and uncomfortable, as the woman who checked us in talked to us like we were toddlers during class. When we asked for an additional card she lectured us about not putting our cards near our cell phones, when we just needed a card for the second guest. . . The room was ugly and old, no extra covers even in the middle of winter. The view was an old parking lot. Needless to say, I do not recommend this place to anyone and will never stay here again. . . Now to top things off, they double charged us. They charged both our credit cards the same amount and now I have the hassle of having to call the accounting department to sort this out. . . The WIFI is not free, welcome back to 2005. Neither is the gym, or anything for that matter. Just a cheap, run down and ugly sight. Just like the registration desk staff.
