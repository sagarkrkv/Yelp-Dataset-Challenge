Awesome burger joint. The place was packed and busy. Our waitor had so many tables but was still able to get us all our food in a timely manner! When the chocolate cake took a bit longer to come out, despite ordering early, they brought our table of 7 free donuts and ice cream! It really was only like a 5 minute wait...not too shabby! They also have a gluten-free menu :)
I heard about this place when I was watching Diner, Drive-In, and Dives... It looked so good on TV, so as soon as I arrived to Las Vegas on Saturday afternoon I went straight here. I arrived around 2:00-2:30 and the host told me it was about a 30 minutes wait.  What I wish she would have told me was the bar is open seating, so people that walked in after me sat down first.  When I was finally sat, they place me in a secondary room by the kitchen which was empty, so I did not understand the long wait time.   . . The staff was all very nice and polite.. . The food was amazing!!!  My wife had The Lonely Bird which she loved.  I had the The "Banh-Mi" Burger which was also amazing.  We both shared the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Pork Belly Steamed Buns.. . I am from Orange County and the closes to me is in L.A. which is a little too far, but next time I am near another location I am defiantly returning.
Awesome burgers spicy miso my favorite.   Always busy which says everything about the place if you have to wait it is well worth it
There were 4 of us in our party and now that they combined the Shoke Ramen restaurant  had good variety. I had a ramen bowl, don't ask what was in it since I couldn't read the ingredients.  The waiter was a great resource. The others in the group had burgers which were very excellent and the Truffle. Fries were tasty. Price was higher than Yelp let on but well worth it.
Great burgers. Since Holstein's went down hill in quality, it's easier for me to give Bachi a solid 5 star rating.. . Before I gave Holstein's a 5 star rating, and compared it to Bachi. But now Bachi is probably the only good burger joint in Vegas (that i know of).
Good food great old school hip hop high ass prices....definitely different items ..like ox tail fries,  different.
Love this place! Really great food, a little different from your normal burger. The loaded fries were amazing!!!!  Big portions for a decent price. The server was knowledgeable and helpful. They seem to dig their job. Overall great impression, will go back whenever we are in Vegas..
I heard about this restaurant from a friend that lives in Vegas and I've now been here a couple of times. The food is great and they have friendly service. One thing they are famous for is their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and it is delicious! The meat is well cooked and it serves as a great appetizer. The next thing to get is their burgers. I've tried their Ronin Burger and the Miyagi-San Burger and they are also cooked to your liking and tastes very good. I recommend to come here when you're leaving your Vegas vacation and you just have to try it!
The burgers are good, but there's a lot going on there. Whatever you decide since they have a pretty extensive menu, remember to order the oxtail fries!!!. . Order:. - Oxtail Fries - we should have gotten 2!. - Salt & Pepper Garlic French Fries - good, but can't be oxtail!. - Spicy Miso Burger. - Shogun Burger - flavor explosions were insane, but you can't really tell it's a burger!. - Bachi Caesar Salad - not sure why this was ordered, but I think he was still drunk. - Sweet Tea - Soooo GOOD!!!!. . . TIP: If you can't come all the way out to Vegas, they just opened one up in LA!
Hands down the best burger I've ever eaten! The Miyagi burger and truffle fries are a MUST! Everything about this burger is absolute perfection. When I go to Bachi Burger I know it will taste amazing, but somehow that first bite still blows me away every time. The wait for a table is usually long and it usually takes a pretty long time to actually get your food, but it's worth it, I promise.
I had the Ronin burger and was happy with it.  The highlight of the night were the Oxtail Fries....Yummmm
Delicious food! Best burger I ever  tasted!
There are 2 of these in Southern California. With that being said, don't order something you can get in California. HELLO FOIE GRAS.. . Shogun burger it is. A massive burger with a patty made of wagyu beef, a slab of unagi, and a beautifully seared slab of fatty rich foie gras - OH HOW I HAVE MISSED THEE. . . I ordered mine the only way a burger should be done (medium rare, DUH) and it came out perfect. The beef was juicy, unagi was sweet, while the foie gras was decadent. It got messy and all over the place, probably why there's always a line for the bathroom. My friend even warned me that I should sit closer to the table when our food came. Sound advice. . . The parmesan truffle sweet potato fries were good, but not amazing. I am just a sucker for sweet potato fries. . . There was no wait for us when we arrived. It was a Sunday during lunch, but then again it was just 2 of us and we had no problems with sitting at the bar. Service was top notch, (although there was a slight sexist incident.. I was dining with a pescetarian so obviously he had a fish burger. When our food came, the runner gave ME the fish burger and the shogun to my friend. I said "other way around" and he said "oh I just assumed the shogun was his because it's meaty and manly. EXCUSE ME!? *rolleyes I digress)  and I would definitely wander off the strip for a Shogun burger again.
The oxtail fries are a must! The burgers were full of flavor and the buns were delicious too. My boyfriend and I tried the Bahn-mi Burger and the Kalbi Burger. The only reason why I'm leaving out that last star is because our waitress forgot my drink order and it took an extremely long time to get our bill. Other than that, this place is definitely a place to try. Will be going back for sure.
The ultimate gourmet burger. This spot is cute, and the menu is well thought out. I always want to try something new, but I'm so addicted to the Crusty Crab, it's what I've ordered each of the five times I've been there; and it's been incredible every single time. Their fries and aoli sauces are equally incredible. . My friends usually order something from the turf- and everyone who has ever been with me has raved about their selection. This place is a local gem.
Best burger I have ever had. I don't generally even like burgers. We got Spicy Miso burger and Kalbi burger. Garlic fries were amazing too!
Great food!! Had the Ronin Burger and it was delicious!!! The oxtail chili cheese fries were amazing! It was my 1st time too! Great place and good food!! Just go!!
We need one of these in New York. And there should be one closer to the strip. I didn't mind going out of our way to come here though, it was totally worth it. I wished that more people came with us so that we could have ordered a wider variety of food to try but there's always next year! . . We started with the duck baos, which were tender, juicy, and flavorful. We also got an order of truffle fries with spicy dipping sauce to share. For burgers I got the Kalbi burger, fiance got the Kiki,future-bro-in-law got the Shogun. I think the Kalbi was the best of the three. The Kiki was good but a little too sweet for a burger. . . Overall, we'll be back for sure, especially for the oxtail friese! See you again next year!
Amazing!!! We came here based off other yelp reviews and we are so glad we did! Tried a ronin burger, a spicy miso burger, and a regular angus burger and they were all fantastic! Best burgers we have ever had. They had such nice combinations of flavors with the burgers. For example the spicy miso burger came with Apple vinaigrette, and normally I cannot stand vinaigrette so I got it on the side in case I didn't like it- it complimented the burger so nicely I can see why they had it in on there!. Staff was also extremely friendly and helpful as to what to pick and what influenced the different burgers.  . Absolutely wonderful and we would definitely come back. We fully agree with the assessment that these are the best burgers in Vegas!!!
This place is overhyped.  Yes the food is more than just your regular burgers but for the price I expected better flavors and not just overwhelmed with grease.
Overhyped....or people are easily impressed.. . Let's start off with the service.  The hostess was unorganized and kept fluttering about. There were plenty of open tables but my party of 2 was kept waiting for almost an hour. And then she sat a group of 4 that came in after us.  . . We were finally sat at a table that had been open for about 20 minutes right next to the people they sat before us. The waitress then came and said she would bring us water, we didn't ask for water but she made the gesture that was never fulfilled until we finally reminded her.  Once we ordered we really didn't see her again until it was time to boot us off the table.  She did make speedy walk bys murming something but she would be gone before we could respond.. . The food...many tables were ordering the ox tail chili on top of fries with an egg.  Woooooo (sarcasm). From the looks and smell, there is a fry truck that makes a brisket poutine (which this basically was) far better.. . I ordered a double Angus burger with fried onion rings (tempura style), bacon (because the waitress made excuses as to why they could not add pork belly from their bahns whoch lead to the conclusion that the bahns were premade) and swiss.. . They also offer waygu (which I suspect is not true or if it is its for those who would ruin a perfectly fine piece of meat and doing the ungodly things they did to their burgers).  Basically they grill their meat, whichever one you ordered and basted the hell out of it with hoison sauce.  Which brings me back to why order a waygu burger and then cover the flavor with a hoison bbq sauce? . . And my friend got the waygu, it was tough and when I asked how it was he said he liked it. How was the meat? I just taste the sauce.. . The fries are run of the mill, but you can get the truffle ones for those eaters who succumb to those parlor tricks.. . In the end Bachi Burger isn't the worst burger joint I have been to, but far from the better ones.  Most people will probably like it (like the group next to us whose buzz words were "waygu" and "truffle oil"), but they also like Ed Hardy shirts, think Mercedes-Benz are awesome cars, and have rocked out to "What Does The Fox Say".
Our party ranged in age from 11 to 57 and we were all satisfied.  We stuck to the burgers.  My cocktail was weak tho.
I came in with high expectations for this place, especially with all the positive reviews already listed.  . . I had the shogun burger, which I picked mainly for the foie gras.  It was good, but not $30 dollar good.  The burger itself was on the sweeter side (good or bad depending on your preference), a bit sloppy due to the sheer size of it and its layers, but I did not enjoy the soggy buns.  . . Unfortunately, the poor service I received here overshadowed the food experience.  I understand restaurants get busy, but there really isn't an excuse for excessive waits and horribly bad service.. . 1)excessive wait to order drinks after we're sat(who is our server?). 2)wait an absurd amount of time for drinks . 3)wait more to order food because drinks were brought by someone else (where is our server?). 4)appetizers finally come out after a long wait, but more annoyingly, having some appetizers come after the main dish because it was forgotten(really?). . To top it off, receiving the wrong bill after the poor service was completely aggravating.  Of course we had to wait for our lost server to come back and tell us :)
The place is a bit over-hyped but its definitely a great innovative burger joint! The food choices is definitely asian-inspired where it brings multiple cultures mixed together very well. . . It had a burger with Foie Gras which was pricey but very very well made. They had some burgers with eggs in it which was a huge plus for me as I'm an eggs guy!. . Their pork belly steam buns was point on and just fantastic! . . The nacho fries was just over the top!. . Red Velvet smoothie really tasted like it! I only wished they were generous of the portion especially when it was $5!!. . The service could have been more attentive, but they were definitely sweethearts making sure we were taken care of when they notice you.
Amazing burgers! Enjoyed kalbi burger, miso buger, and Portuguese donuts!! The pork belly buns are yummy too, but I think I've had better at momo fuku! I recommend this place
If you want a perfect burger go to BACHI BURGER! The meat, the bun, the fries, the sauces OH EM GEE! Make sure to order the oxtail fries! They are a party on a plate! Service is great and food is phenomenal! My favorite is the spicy miso burger add avocado! So bomb!
This place seems crowded at all times, so make sure to schedule extra wait time! We were there around 11:20  for party of 6 and waited about 20 minutes to be seated.. . The burgers were unique and interesting. I had wagyu burger, and I did not think the beef was better than Angus burger ( but it costs more).  My husband had spicy miso burger (angus) and that was tasty! . . I will goback there when we have out of town guests because this place is unique. I do not think we will be regulars there though. It is pricey for burgers.
Tried this place in June when I came to visit Vegas for a weekend of fun. I was embarking into an awesome food traveling that time around, since all the times I went to Vegas, all I did was party. I found out about this place through Diners, Drive-ins &Dives. Yes, I can watch that all day long. Dont judge. Im a fatty :) Anyway, enough with the intro.... . Wait was about an hour. It was PACKED. I was guessing it was THAT good, that every Las Vegas partier came here for hangover cure. It was a pain in the butt having to wait outside knowing that it was 1000 degrees outside. Waiting area of the restaurant was tiny, but I managed to squeezed in.. . Food: Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- My yelper people were absolutely right about this one. YUM YUM YUM YUM! I would order it again in a heart beat. It was meaty, fries were crispy &flavorful.. . Pork Buns: It was like the asian tacos. Sweet pork flavor, in a soft fluffy white asian buns. Delicious! . . Shogun Burger- Had foie gras, unagi &wagyu beef. This burger was okay, but definitely NOT worth $26. Maybe it was because I am not a big fan of foie gras(duck liver), because of the gamey taste, &the burger is a little on the sweeter side. Unagi made the burger a little fishy, but the wagyu beef was good. . . Banh Mi Burger- Awesome rendition of the Bahn Mi Sandwich. I definitely recommend.. . Service: It was okay. Waitress couldve been a lil more friendly, but she was preggers from what I remember so I understand that her job could probably be a lil stressful. . . I cannot wait to travel back to Vegas &try other dishes at this place.
love the banh-mi burger! It was definitively my favorite.. . My fiancee and I went here, he loves the typical (plain) American burger and in love a mouthful of flavors. So this is the perfect spot to compromise! . . Some may wonder why the burger only comes as itself and not with fries or something on the side, it's because they are HUGE! I can barely finish one, less than with their fries. Their fries are HUGE, definitively something you should share. I love fries, so they had a few flavors to choose from. I usually try the garlic fries or gravy fries. With any actually can't do wrong.. . Ambience is nice, wait time can be hot or miss. Either we get seated right-away or we have a log wait ahead of us. No reservations below 10 people, the few times I had called ahead. . . Price is mid range, Definitively worth for these 'fusion' mixes of burgers.
Love this place and now combined with great ramen.   So why so low.... 1pm Monday post Xmas week and 35 min wait. BUT. 10 tables of 2+ free and was told they were seating slow to deal with demand.  WTF. If I owned the place I would die.....only 12 people waiting and a wait with open tables????? . . Thought them to be foodie restaurant .. Leading edge....they gave us a coupon to go to their other restaurant 10 miles away.....Really?. . Went to Zenshin close by.... Vote with your feet!
After learning that Wagyu is the American version of the Japanese Kobe Beef, we ordered the Oxtail Fries and the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger.  This Asian Fusion burger was great!  I am a sucker for fried eggs on burgers.  Tastes like a fru fru version of Smashburger.  Pretty pricey for a burger but a must try!  Oxtail fries had a tangy bbq taste and very filling.  I only ate 1/2 of the order since it is a large portion.
The Ronin is absolutely delicious! All of their fries are amazing. My friends and I are from Reno and tried this place out in June this year. We're still talking about how amazing their burgers are. The wait was long, about an hour. We decided to wait and it was well worth it. We are planning a trip to Vegas next month and the fist place we will visit is Bachi Burger!
It's not a place to sit around for a long conversation just eat and get out. On Sunday's it's a long wait, and they don't take reservations , be considerate of others theres people waiting to grub as well. Don't just lounge like you have no place to be. . Melissa our server she's friendly and quick with suggestions seeing that we were struggling to find something appropriate for my 4 year old and two year old. The meat patty flavorful and juicy but we didn't care for the burger bun it too soft like a texture of sweet Hawaiian rolls. All my 5 kids removed the buns and just ate the meat patties. We love the sweet potatoes fries with garlic and oxtail the flavor reminded me of chili fries
