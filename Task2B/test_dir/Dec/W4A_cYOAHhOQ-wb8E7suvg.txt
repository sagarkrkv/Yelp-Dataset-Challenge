Popped my Vegas show cherry with Le Reve...and it was one expensive cherry!. . We decided to try the VIP Experience that includes a bottle of Champagne, chocolate strawberries, chocolates and personal server.  I wondered if people were paid extra to say "Best Seat in the House" every time we showed our tickets.  . . The doors open about thirty minutes before the show starts.  I was a little surprised there wasn't a separate earlier VIP entrance. . .  Since it was my first Vegas show, I didn't really know what to expect.  My first impressions of the 360 stage was that it looked immersive and I don't really think there's a bad seat in the house.  Our seats were at thevery top, and I wished that we were a little closer, but it allowed us to see everything.  Also, there were small TVs at the bottom of our feet that was supposed to give us a "backstage" peek of the show, but I never really saw anything really out of the ordinary.  . . It was a nice touch to have a bottle of champagne and chocolates waiting for us at our seats and really added to the whole experience.. . The show was about an hour and a half and there never was a dull moment.  I just wished that there was more of a narrative so that I could follow along.  One minute, it looks like the scene is taking place in the underworld and in the next taking place in the clouds.  Since it is called "The Dream," anything goes and is open to interpretation.. . Thoroughly enjoyed the show, and it won't be my last Vegas show.  For those debating whether or not to try the VIP experience, I say go for it!
Another good one. This another must see shows in Vegas. Got a give those acrobats a lot of credit. They are all good and incredible. Bravo
FROM BEGINNING to the VERY END... WOW WOW WOW. I thought that this show would just be something to watch, just to pass time and be entertained.. . NOPE. BLOWN AWAY, JAW DROPPING MOMENTS. This show, keeps you plugged in. Even if you came in, all jet lagged, you will NEVER fall asleep, or nod off for just a minute. The lights, the arts, the bodies, the water, the danger factor, the disbelief of how such feats could be accomplished... all twirled into this dark room. The human mind and body can do miraculous feats. The imagination can create such beauty, that can make the audience laugh, cry, be awed, and feel fear, all at once. It's like reading a book, but you're included. You see the words laid out in true form, and sometimes you feel the water sprinkle onto your skin, and immediately you've come that much closer to THE DREAM of the LE REVE.. . No pictures please, because these performers risk their lives to give us such a surprise. WATCH, and LITERALLY FEEEEEEEL THE DREAM, and be taken away from your troubles.
Amazing! The show was approx 1.5 hrs. I sat on the C row which is 2 away from splash zone. Cheaper tickets = closer to the stage area. They are good seats, however, I recommend those awesome champagne seats of anything mid-level. I felt like I looked up a lot, but I wasn't straining my neck or anything. I read someone's review about the dream being romantic to chaotic, that person is crazy, it's a DREAM, you're suppose to have ups and downs. It's a water show, cirque sole il and dancing! 1 ticket gets you all of that. Love It. All the performers are professional athletics!!! WOW factor.
After watching three different Cirque du Soleil shows, I think that Le Reve is a fairly decent show (but not the best in my opinion). Actually ... Le Reve is NOT a Cirque du Soleil show - Steve Wynn purchased the rights from Franco Dragone (the original creator who also produced "O" and Mystere) and Mr.Wynn's production team made few changes to the original Le Reve show.. . I got $20 off on Premium Zone tickets (rows C-K) for $114 (regular price $134 without tax and "internet web fee"). If you've already purchased your tickets and want to modify or change to a different showtime, then you can call the customer service hotline and they will be more than happy to make the change for you ... at a cost of $8.50 per ticket. . . I would leave your kids at home (or hotel ... or Circus Circus) ... lots of beautiful, romantic, touchy, and intimate scenes that some kids might not be able to understand. Treat this show as a PG-13 movie.. . Expect 30% water ballet, 30% high-dives (from about three to five stories tall, 15% aerial gymnastics + acrobatics, 15% ballroom dancing. 5% magic + comedy, and 5% water show similar to the Fountains of Bellagio (except this version was smaller, more colorful, and better).. . Everyone likes to compare Le Reve with Cirque de Soleil "O" because both are water shows. Personally, I still prefer "O" because "O" had more interesting and eye-catching moments. Overall a very solid water show, but Le Reve is definitely not on my top three must-watch shows.
I personally think this show is exceptional. . If you've seen this show, you can skip on the rest of the shows in Vegas. Or perhaps, see this show last. . This is not a Cirque du Soleil, although cirque du soleil is just as amazing. . . The performers of la reve are amazing. They perform stunts that are unbelievable. I questioned myself...how are they able to reDefine physics? These people must have balls made out of steel. Gravity had no effect on the performers. . Would definitely see it again!
went on my birthday 12/09 and it was excellent. one of the best circ style shows we have seen. and weve been to at least 10 different ones thru the years both here in vegas and around the southwest in tents.
One of my favorite show in vegas. . . Stunning performance with awesome music. The show keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole time. Amazing acrobats and dancers. . . If you sit at the first row you might get splashed!. . Pictures are allowed as long as you don't use flash or video!
This is a beautiful show.  The lighting is spectacular and the acrobatics is amazing.  There is someone doing something every minute of the show.  The story is about a girl who wants to accept the love of her beloved, but her inner demons prevents her from doing so.  Throughout the entire show, you are inside her dreams while she deals with her inner turmoil in fantastical ways.  Or at least, that was my interpretation of it, my boyfriend thought she was fighting the demons of her beloved instead, so yeah, it was slightly confusing.. . The theater is set up in an intimate atmosphere, where everyone is close to the stage and near the water.  We were 1 row up from the "Splash Zone" and we could still feel little droplets of water and feel the humidity in the room.  Throughout the performance, there were performers coming in from various entrances of the theater and onto the stage.  It was amazing watching the main performer walk on the wet platform with high heels, to watch the many acrobats dive into the water from a height of 2-3 stories as well as see all the performers kick their legs up from underwater for minutes on end.  What was most inspiring was how they set up the mechanics of the stage.  It changes from solid ground to complete water, to a mixture of both and then even becomes a fountain.  . . The only reason that I would give this 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that 4 scenes of the show lacked a focal point and didn't really add to the story.  There were many people on stage doing many different things simultaneously.  It looked great, but my eyes didn't know where to focus.  At the same time, there were other performers coming onto the stage from the theater area.  It was during these moments, in the dim lighting, that I almost nodded off.  If they can simplify these scenes and somehow create a stronger connection in the story line, this would be an even more amazing show.
I took my wife here while we were in Vegas for the weekend. I had been told that this show is by far the best in Vegas. Don't get me wrong, this show is GREAT but, O is still superior. . . The best part about the experience is the seating. NO ONE has a bad seat, NO ONE. The chairs are very comfortable and there is plenty of leg room I'm 6 2" and sometimes theaters can get a little cramped. . . If you are staying at the Wynn or you want to see some of the best shows in Vegas check this one out. If you can only see one show and you want to see the best show in Vegas, go watch O at the Bellagio.
Located in the Wynn. Well priced is this romance water show. One can find deals on Vegas.com, half priced show tickets, and you buy tickets at the box office. . . There are typically two shows on most nights. Seating show times are prompt. No late in which eliminates any distractions of people in your line of obstruction. . . Snacks are available for purchase.. . Seating is comfortable and there aren't any bad views as the theatre is round. We got the third row.. . The stage and actors move around the water stage which transforms through the story of romance. Short intermission keeps the stories and audience is engaged. Performers don't focus on any one side of the round arena.. . Good: Story, no bad seats, no interrupted views. . Bad: Not open everyday. The good shows are usually closed some days of the week. . . I wouldn't mind watching it more than once.
My wife and I loved this show.  In our opinion, it was better than "O", actually it is probably our favorite show of the 12 we have seen.  It's a circle theater at the Wynn and appears that there isn't really a bad seat.  Some believe that the higher seats are actually better (as with most of the Cirque shows).  I don't like giving away too much to avoid spoiling but in a nutshell, a must see!
I've had my fair share of Cirque du Soleil performances and while this isn't one of them, I think out of all the ones I've seen this was the only one that I actually got to 'SEE'. The entire theater was built rather intimately, smaller than most I've been to, but that means all the viewers are closer to the performers and stage. With the way it's built like a coliseum as another Yelper has mentioned, there are no bad seats in the house. I actually got to see the entire performance, unlike most times at Cirque du Soliel shows I have to use binoculars to get a simple glimpse at the show. For the price of $136, it quite spectacular.. . The costumes all the performers donned on were beautiful and their makeup and props were also so meticulously put together. There were roaring flames, flying acrobats, water flying, feathers, and much much more. The show is about 90 minutes long and it was a great 90 minutes! . . Here's a great tip: Go to the restroom beforehand! Moving out of the seats is a pain in the ass.
The original definition of awesome is "that which inspires awe." Le Reve fulfills this original definition. The show was beautifully done with wonderful, colorful scenery, fantastic acrobatics, and amazing special effects. . The ambiance was beautiful, resembling the inside of a circus. When watching the show, the audience could do nothing but marvel at the up close encounters with performers, the death defying drops, and seemingly impossible acrobatics that the show offered. . Similar shows, like Cirque de Soleil are fantastic, but Le Reve gives all of them a run for their money. Don't be confused, this is not a Cirque show, but the talent and showmanship of the entire performance left me sitting in my seat, wondering at the witchcraft I had just witnessed. In general, this was an amazing show that I would see again in a heart beat. If you are in town, go see Le Reve. It is a must see.
