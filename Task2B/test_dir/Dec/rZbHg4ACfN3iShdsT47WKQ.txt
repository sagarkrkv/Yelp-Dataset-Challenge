So Far best BBQ in AZ.  Family finished everything.  It was really good.  Had the baby back and the brisket. Kids loved it will definitely be back.
Best BBQ in Arizona, Texas beef ribs are outstanding! Customer service is great and I love the ambiance. Pricey but worth every penny!
Good atmosphere, Good service, Great food and you will come back for more
Just a great experience! . I went here for some Good-Bye beers with my wife and parents on their last day in Phoenix. We went at about 6pm on a Sunday and were shocked by the Awesome Happy Hour Deals they had!!! $3 beer specials, $3 Fireball Shots, $0.99/6 wings, and they had a grill set up in the outdoor lounge area where they were serving up $1 Burgers, Dogs, Steak Tacos! . Our server Amethyst was great! So attentive, made sure we were never thirsty. My dad had a Bacon Wrapped Hot Dog and loved it! I went for the Steak Tacos that were hot off the grill and amazing. Seriously the best steak taco I have had in Phoenix! Simple and delicious made with great steak! Fresh toppings bar set up next to the grill. My Mom went for the BBQ Wings, and of course I stole a couple from her! . I can't speak for their Full Restaurant Menu packed with Meat Goodies, but after our great experience here we will for sure go back! . I personally can't wait to try the Smoked Prime Rib! I have never seen that done before, it has to be amazing! . Great job! Thanks for the awesome service Amethyst! I wish I had asked about your schedule as I'd like to go back when you're working!
This is good barbeque in an unlikely spot -- Phoenix.  The meats are all slow-cooked, so everything is fork-fall-apart, Kansas City-style.  They have some variations in sauces, too -- a vinegary Carolina-type sauce, a spicy one and a sweeter KC sauce.. . The sides are well-prepared, including traditional cole slaw; corn; beans; potatoes.  For appetizers, try the sauteed shrimp...perfectly cooked and garlicky.  When all is said and done and you hate yourself for eating that much meat, they give you a brown bag of freshly made, sugary mini-donuts.  Just so you can hate yourself a little more.. . Service is always friendly and usually prompt.  Recommended!
My husband and I  absolutely adore the BBQ baby back ribs. Worth the drive!
This is a neat place to take out of towners.  It's off I-17 but very out of the way and dumpy looking from the outside.  Then, surprise - it IS open!  . . We tried the whole hog heaven which was plenty for 4 people.  We got the St Louis ribs and baby back ribs - both delicious and saucy.  We also got the hot links and beef brisket.  I wasn't a fan of the hot links.  The beef brisket was slightly dry but with a bit of sauce it was quite delicious.  . . We also got corn and macaroni and cheese as sides.  I wouldn't recommend the corn - its very buttery and overcooked.  Mac and cheese was better, but mostly because its nice against the salty meats.. . We also started with the Q-rolls(?) which was beef rolled in pastry material.  The sauce it comes with made it quite tasty as well.. . All in all, if you're looking for a nice, sit-down bbq restaurant in Phoenix, this one's hard to beat!
Called for a reservation...needed to wait an hour to get in, but I would rather chill in our hotel suite than trying to awkwardly stay out of the way, waiting for a table for an hour there. We got there and were instantly greeted and instantly seated! So far everything was fantastic! Our server, Carmela, came right over...and was super sweet, complete with great service through out our meal! I had a cup of baked potato soup which was good...not fabulous...but good. The corn bread, on the other hand, was amazing...not sure how they made it so perfectly...but I need it everyday! The brisket was excellent, the roni's and cheese was scrumptious! The shoestring fries...were shoestring fries...nothing special...but ultimately sides don't really matter! The portions were very generous, couldn't finish my meal...and I really wanted to! And then the little Thank Q donut holes were a nice, sweet little touch of dessert! Unfortunately, we live in CA, so we won't be able to come back...unless through some kismet, chance of serendipity we end up back at the second bbq heaven on earth!! If you live by here or find yourself at one of the nearby hotels, then by all means stop in for a great, hearty meal!
Best barbecue in phoenix! Love the brisket oh man the prime rib is so tender just like the ribs they practically fall off the bone. Did I mention the roasted veggies potatoe salad chicken wings I could go on and on about this place but you gotta check it out for yourself I know I will  be back.
We had a large party on Saturday night and were promptly seated when at least ten guests arrived.. . I ordered the Firebird Rotisserie Chicken with potato salad and grilled vegetables on the side.  The chicken was perfectly cooked with moist breast and dark meat.  We also enjoyed their famous homemade cornbread.  My buddies went straight to the red meat, which I looked at with envy.. . I definitely will return here.
The BEST BBQ I've tasted since we moved to Arizona! Pork ribs so tender the meat was falling off the bone, beef ribs so meaty you could make a meal of two unless you eat like me :). Pulled pork and brisket to cry over they are so tender & smokey. My wife said she would happily go back. She had the fried chicken and loved it, though next time gravy on the side. She did try my pork & brisket and loved them too. Bobby Q is a definite BBQ lovers restaurant. Service by Linzy 1980 was quite good she was patient as we made up our minds as to what we wanted and when I explained I had ordered baby backs & beef bones but was served St. Louis and baby backs she promptly went back to the kitchen and brought the beef bones, only having a satisfied customer on her mind. We will be back! Oh yeah the onion ring loaf excellent and one of the three sauces they serve is sure to please your taste buds.
Best BBQ I've ever had.  I come here every time I'm in Phoenix. . . Q Rolls (Pulled Pork Taquitos with glorious chipotle dipping sauce). Cornbread (Unlimited). Babyback Ribs. All sides. Bobby Q mini doughnuts. . Service always friendly and attentive.  Highly recommended.
The security is very rude and disrespectful,  so are most of the managers.  I don't recommend anyone of color to go there because they are racist and they discriminate!!! This wasn't the first time it's happened to myself and a few others in line.  They say no flats on ladies night yet all the Hispanic chicks were flat boots, yet when my sister had them on they turned us away! DISCRIMINATON! !!!!! Who ever own this place needs new security, management ASAP or they will loose a lot of business. As long as your popping bottles they don't care.  Smh, the Damn food isn't even that great! If you're looking for a good time this isn't the place.
Like a little slice of good southern bbq dropped into the Arizona desert... Huge portions,  very well balanced sauces, and awesome happy hour specials. I'll definitely be back.
Good Good service Ribs were amazing  Mac n cheese was good great sides are sever Alicia was super sweet
Growing up, Bobby McGee's Restaurant used to be a staple eatery that my family and friends loved. We knew we could get good food and enjoy a setting that was colorful, eclectic, and maybe even charming in its own special way... if that's not too far-fetched..all at the same time. Once I moved onto college, and others went their separate ways, we all forgot about Bobby McGee's. It would often be a topic that would arise at a dinner convo, "What ever happened to that one place we used to go to near 27th Avenue and Northern?" But that was all that ever materialized.. . Luckily, I was reunited with this restaurant, now known as Bobby-Q's. It has since transitioned into a Kansas City/Texas mixture type barbecue, but still a great atmosphere! After a long day of rock climbing, my friends and I were famished and they suggested getting barbecue. Once we arrived, all the memories started flooding back of this place, and I love what it's become. The barbecue is really good! It's actually one of my favorites, I'm surprised to say. Three of us shared the Whole Hog Heaven, which is a major platter where you can choose 2 ribs, 2 meats, and 3 sides. Our selections: the Baby Back ribs, the beef ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, potato salad, macaroni and cheese, and grilled veggies. The rib meat was tender and "fall off the bone" type texture. The  baby back ribs were by far my favorite of the bunch. . . While waiting for our order, our group also shared the smoked brisket Q-rolls with chipotle dip. These were really delicious but kind of reminded me of eating a mini chimi since the phylo dough was so flaky and crispy. There was a small heap of roasted corn served on the plate as well that was super smoky in flavor. . . Even though it is the middle of winter, the patio was still very comfortable since all the heaters overhead were on. There is a metal waterfall sculpture that extends the entire length of the patio so it is very soothing and entertaining to have the sound of "rain" behind you as you're eating outside. Ashlynn, our waitress, was very accommodating to our large group of 7 that even included 3 super energetic kids. She even treated us with extra doughnuts at the end when we were finishing our meal. We will definitely return again and again to Bobby Q's!
We found this place by accident, a very happy accident. The wait staff are very friendly and accommodating. The waitress we had was super friendly and helpful, she brought us samples of things we had questions about, etc. You receive a complimentary sweet cornbread circle for a starter, very tasty. The entree options are well rounded, there is something for everyone. The portions are huge, so be prepared! And at the end of the meal you are given a complementary mini donut covered in sugar. A great experience!
This place is amazing ! We got The Hog Heaven Sampler, which came with 2 style of ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, & 3 sides. I did not know that BBQ could taste so good. The BEST I have ever had. Our waitress Ashland had to be one of the best waitresses ever. She was so nice. My Wife & I can't wait to come back  !
Full disclosure: I'm a vegetarian.  What's that you say?  A vegetarian?!  What the heck is a vegetarian doing reviewing a BBQ place?  Settle down folks, I come in peace!. . I have found myself at Bobby Q's a couple times now for my husband's work holiday party.  As I'm sure you could guess, this is likely the last place I would consider going, as I don't eat meat and I certainly wouldn't expect a bbq place to cater to my diet. :)  But I have to say it is probably one of the most vegetarian-friendly, meat-centric restaurants I have ever been to - is that a thing?  (Sorry Bobby Q's if I'm ruining your rep). . If you are a vegetarian and somehow find yourself here, you can definitely survive - in fact, you can actually really enjoy your meal. There are a few salads on the menu and also a bunch of great side dishes that you can assemble (tapas-style) to create a tasty vegetarian meal - my favorite combo is their baked potato (sans bacon), roasted veggies (super tasty) and the mac and cheese (seriously good).  In addition to the salads and sides there are several starters on the menu that will work as well as some a-la-carte items.  . . The staff there are great and they are super accommodating - no eye rolling when you say, "I'm vegetarian, can I order a bunch of sides?" just a friendly, "Sure, what would you like?"  . . And for all you meat eaters, check out the rest of the reviews - Bobby Q's clearly knows what they are doing.  Both times I've been there they are packed and its clearly a popular place.
