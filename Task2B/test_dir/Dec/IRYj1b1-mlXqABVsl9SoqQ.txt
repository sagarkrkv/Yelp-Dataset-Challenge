This place is crazy packed every time I go. The last time I went was on thanksgiving day but I'm already planning another trip to vegas just for some more tacos. Fat much..? Its just so gooood! Don't judge me (: 4 stars because of the long, messy, unorganized lines. Keep in mind that there are signs indicating what you could order from the line you stand in. For example if you want asada you have to stand in that line, if you want al pastor go to that line and so on.
Awesome place to go if you want some good affordable food. It's kind of confusing as to how to order, since the place was completely packed. But basically, there are different lines for different types of meats. It's probably easiest to get friends to stand in each line to get different types of tacos.. . I got the carne asada fries ($5 for small portion, $10 for large portion) for which there was no line at all (it's off to the side). I was craving fries hahaha. The rest of my friends got different types of tacos. For the fries themselves were alright, but the toppings were amazing. I would definitely try the fries with adobada (spicy pork) the next time I go and grab a few tacos.
Best tacos I have tasted. The pork tacos are the best. It is so yummy that I want to go back just for these tacos. The best part, cheapest mean I had the whole time I was in Las Vegas. Amazing!!!
I hope they make a chain in every single city in the states. That's all. . We went here for lunch on a Sunday before driving home. It was packed and was confusing at first how to order. There are different lines for different meats you want, so make sure to look at the lines and plan accordingly. It really helps if you have a friend with you to have the friend wait in another line. After you get amazing tacos with variety of meat, you go to the counter to pay.. . I highly recommend Adobada, Carne Asada, and Chorizo. They are amazing tacos for very cheap that every taco-lovers should try
Best $#*&ing tacos!  Get the Al Pastor/Adobado. Get more than you think you'll want because you'll want more.
Greatest Tacos Ever! Heard it's has closed down at the strip location....sooooo bummed!!!!!!!!!
This is where I fell in love with authentic tacos and the fries are heavenly. If you are visiting Vegas this is a great place to eat but be ready for a line. It was around 2 in the morning Vegas time and my husband and I had to wait an hour in line to get to our food. It was nice getting to know people in the process. Lots of locals. Total Dive. Get the tacos and the fries. The prices are phenomenal as well. Highly recommend.
Bomb tacos!  Just like TJ tacos!  My favorite were the tripa and al pastor!  Must try if your in vegas!
Went to Vegas Thursday 4 December, parked the car and went straight to Tacos El Gordon on the strip and it was closed....we didn't see a sign about remodeling....anyone know what's going on????  Thankfully we live 3 miles from their Chula Vista location but we were really looking forward to our favorite tacos (adobado) while on our mini vacation.
Actually I've been here 3 times already, and each time I've gone I've never been dissatisfied with the selection of the food items. Not much of a selection, but just all the favorites. Served fast and healthy portioned. Great eats for less.
Giving 4 stars because we've really enjoyed the tacos in the past. We just went to El Gordon and the restaurant is closed and gutted. Not sure what happened. Hopefully just closed for a temporary remodel.
This place is out of business. When we come to vegas we like to eat here. So we stopped. And saw they were no longer in business
this location is now closed =(
--------------------------------------------------. IMPORTANT NOTICE:. --------------------------------------------------. . THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED DOWN. I just walked over an hour ago hoping to get an adobada (spicy pork with pineapple) taco, but l left empty-handed.. . Go to the one in Downtown if you still wanna go!
This place was my go to place when I went to vegas! Probably the most legit Mexican tacos I've ever had! Their soft taco shells are made perfectly. I love the concept of having some sides to add on (they had turnips, lime, etc). I had beef, chicken, and I even tried the beef tongue and they were all delicious! This is the best taco place I've ever had and you know they are legit when the actual workers are Mexican! I love how the meat is in front of you when you order and they cut it in front of you. They make their own  taco shells and their meat are always freshly cooked.. . Very impressed with the food. And the servers are great and fast. This is a self serve place so you go out to the patio and eat it outside. You also clean up after yourself. Perfect for quick snacks at late hours (definitely a go to place after night of drunkenness and clubbing).
Get the PASTOR.... . OK now that we've got that out of the way, having lived literally dozens of feet away for 3 years, this isthe single most thing I miss about my name old hood. The food is a top notch hole in the wall. With my homeboy always (usually) behind the counter, the service is always friendly, and this became the go to quick dinner spot for virtually all my friends coming here for their pregame dinner (which often led to the round 2 trip, post game drunken snack). While I almost always got the pastor here, both the chicken and steak are good quality and I'm partial to the Costillas en Res con Papas (sp?) You'll see a picture of it on the menu, love the grilled jalapeno.. . Short story long, and not just because I have more than a few drunken (and sober) memories, but this is by far my favorite pastor in the city and I will always keep coming back!
Tacos El Gordo is the only authentic Mexican food shop I would recommend in Vegas. The lines may be ridiculously long and all of the seating may be outdoors, but the food is worth it. The meat is sliced right in front of you and you can get all the extras (like pineapple) for free.. Each line is for a different type of meat. Make sure to read the signs! I hate being in restaurants where I don't understand the menu/how to order/what to order. Tacos El Gordo is exactly that, so bring a friend that knows what they're doing! The tacos are small-- 10 tacos for a guy is a good start.
Not at old location on the strip.  Now about 3 miles away on Charleston, towards downtown. This one more crowded than the first"
We loved the tacos..ate at 2am and the place was still crowded...worth the wait..
Living in Arizona for several years, I have been to a fair amount of taco shops. But I have never been to one like this. The moment my boyfriend and I walked in the door we knew we were in for something unique.. . We open the door and the first thing to hit us is the smoke. Immediately following was the smell. When you walk inside it's like you are walking into the grill itself. If they have a ventilation system you'd never know it. So be prepared, you will smell like meat when you leave.. . The first thing you need to figure out is which line to stand in. If you want more than one kind of taco be prepared to stand in two lines because you can't stand in the carne asada line and order the al pastor tacos. I recommend you divide and conquer. I waited for the asada and my boyfriend went for the al pastor. But mind you, these lines are long and slow so even if you split up you'll both be waiting a while. . . Luckily, the wait is worth it. After we acquired our tacos, we paid, and went outside to find a table. Fortunately, someone was getting up to leave so we snagged a spot. (oh yeah, the tables are as hard to get as the tacos) We quickly devoured everything. The tortillas are fresh, the meat is seasoned and prepared perfectly and the salsa is a great complement. Seriously some of the best tacos I've ever had. . . Next time I find myself in Vegas this will be at the top of my to-do list.
It was pretty confusing.  There are separate lines for different types of meats or fries.  Stand in the line of the meat you want to order and don't be a noob like me and stand in the shortest line.  I realized there were separate lines once I looked up and noticed that there were signs haha. . . . VAMPIRO:  I ordered an asada vampiro. It's kind of like a tostada with melted cheese and a special salsa.  It was really good.  The crispiness of the tostada and the taste of the melted cheese is an awesome combo!!. . CARNE ASADA TACOS: A safe choice.  And I wasn't disappointed. These met my standards and were comparable to the taco trucks in LA.. . . It's pretty cool to experience and it's pretty affordable.  As chaotic as it gets in there, they have a decently organized system.  Seating is available outside under their covered patio.  Parking can also be limited, but we got lucky during the time we went. I definitely want to come back and try their carne asada fries!!
Awesome, authentic Mexican tacos.  All kinds of meat that...er...I wouldn't eat. Did I mention it's authentic ? I had the asada and pastor tacos. I assume by everyone's smiles that the brain and internal organ tacos were yummy as well. Lines for different meats are kinda confusing, but, they help you sort it out. If you are a gringo ( like me ), bring a Mexican.  It helps. ;-)
Our las Vegas Blvd location is closed we have moved to 3260 losee rd 89030 same food bigger location .we moved because the owner of the property changed our locks to the doors because they want to open a taco shop like ours
