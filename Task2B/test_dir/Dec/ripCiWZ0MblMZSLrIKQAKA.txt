I'll make this short and sweet - . . PROS:. - Good location - cab rides to various hotels on the strip were around $10 or less. - Starbucks, McDonald's, fastfood in the hotel . - Relaxed casino (they advertise $5 Blackjack but there was only one table). - Friendly staff that cares - everyone was really, really nice. I had a package delivered and they sent someone to unlock the business office for me even though it was closed . . CONS:. - NO FREE WI-FI - this ended up being a HUGE pain in the butt, especially when we wanted to look for places to eat on Yelp or look other stuff up! . - No mini fridge - the ice machine was also broken on our floor so that ended up being annoying for the drinks we bought  . . Basically, what you pay is what you get here. I went to Vegas during Thanksgiving weekend with three other girlfriends and it ended up being $99 / person for four nights. Honestly, I wouldn't have minded paying $20 more per night to have wi-fi, mini fridge, etc. But if you want somewhere cheap and convenient, this is it!
stayed here for my 23rd birthday weekend. from  nov 19th -nov 23rd. weve stayed here plenty of other times before we like this hotel that is why i decided to stay here for my birthday.the room was nice and room service was very neat and quick to respond. my only issue i always have with monte carlo is at the night of check in i arrived at maybe 12:30 AM "didnt want to drive in the morning and stil lpay for early check in " so we decided to pay for the extra night. we arrive at the front desk not busy at all. go up to the employee to check in ask for single bed and he says they dont have any single beds. really??? out of all the rooms you have here your all booked up for single beds on a wednesday night. so i said that wasnt going to work he offers a suite upgrade for extra $ ofcourse with a single bed i say no. he responds with would you like to talk to my manager i said yes absolutely. he walks away. 10 min go by comes back says " my manager just opened up a room for you" ok sure. so we go to our room and next to our room there was the wall paper hanging off the wall with tape on it. really for a "high end" hotel i didnt expect that they didnt fix it until the weekend hit. it didnt bug me so much but it just looked tacky. besides that the room was great ,beds are comfy, bathroom was clean. i just always seem to have an issue at check in even though im a repeated customer here.
Even with construction going on- . It's noisy - . Went to front desk this am, Thomas very helpful- we got earplugs and a generous credit to eat at a restaurant! Above and beyond exceptional service !
This is the 3rd time staying here. We enjoy staying here because it's close to everything plus the staff is always so welcoming. . . This time though the rooms were clean but they definitely need to start maintenance on them! They are starting to look worn. There was construction right outside, so with all the noise it was distracting and I was woken early! . . The water drained slow in the shower. I mentioned at check out but the guy who helped us didn't seem to care. He did apologize but there was no genuine tone to it. . . The bed was not comfy and I think it also has to do with the fact that they really need to update the rooms.  I wonder how old that mattress was? . . Sad to say but my stay was mediocre! Monte Carlo come on you  can do better.
These folks know how to move people through their establishment. Front counter staff friendly and efficient. Concierge was very helpful and friendly when booking shows and tours. . . Hotel restaurants were expensive but convenient. The fast food options were useful and inexpensive. Take your pick.  Lol. . Where we had an issue was with the room itself. We arrived and the first thing we did was check the room for cleanliness. There was body hair in the bed and icky looking white spots all over the bathroom floor so we called the front desk.  They immediately and courteously moved us to another room that was in much better shape although obviously well used. . . The new room was clean but there were skid marks on the office chair and the lampshades on some of the lights were broken. (see pictures) . . Our daily housekeeper did a good job of keeping our room clean and well stocked with water and coffee supplies. The in-room coffee maker worked well and made surprisingly good coffee, one cup at a time. . . The bed was surprisingly comfortable and the pillows fluffy. I usually don't sleep well in hotels but I had no problem sleeping here. I was really pleased with the mattress and pillows. . . Overall, the hotel isnicely equipped and convenient to the strip. Parking is problematic while construction is underway next door on the new arena. . . Be aware that while the facility overall is quite nice, the hotel rooms themselves are not in good shape and getting pretty ragged around the edges.
Seriously?! There isn't a well placed outlet anywhere in my room and no WiFi?! Are you kidding me?! The shower is awful and there's redneck crap all over the hotel. What a terrible hotel.. . Edit: I'll be adding more soon.
They charged 20 usd for each, already we paid whole amount to expedia.. So we did not understand, they said it is just deposit but we understood that it is not. Cheating Monte Carlo, also they did not give the exact room which we reserved, the view was also bad, we were looking at construction area. Thanks for this terrible weekend!
Seriously?! There isn't a well placed outlet anywhere in my room and no WiFi?! Are you kidding me?! The shower is awful and there's redneck crap all over the hotel.. . There's more!. . Paper thin, tiny shower towels. The water doesn't drain when you take a shower so you have cold water for your feet. The bed messed my back up, so now I have to go to the chiropractor.. . Then you had the dealer at the craps table. I was standing about 3 to 4 feet back. I had my phone in my hands behind my back. It was unlocked and he tried locking it as he walked by. He was straight faced. No smile like he was joking. Don't you touch my f*cking phone. I have I picture of the guy I'll be reporting to the hotel. He should be happy that I was too tired to chew him out. . . Screw this place.
We loved the monte...great location and we have always had top notch service. We stay here a few times a year and usually have nothing but wonderful things to say and recommend it to our friends and family. That being said this stay was incredibly different after a few hours wait for the room we had to move three different times due to bad oder, uncleanliness and filth. Even the third room had hair, dirt and a leaky faucet in the bathroom but we were too nervous of what we may get next to move again. I have never asked to change rooms in a hotel ever. There was also a room service cart full of half eaten food, not ours, parked outside our room for over 2 days and when I called to ask to see if someone could retrieve the food the front desk attendant snapped that I should call room service to do so it was not her job . For the most part The service and amenities were up to par but it is sad to say we spent the rest of the trip discussing other options for a hotel next time we head to vegas.
If you're looking to stay somewhere that's wallet friendly, the Monte Carlo will get the job done. They're clean, they have a casino and pool, just don't expect too many frills!
This place is great. The hotel/resort is beautiful and the rooms are roomy, clean and elegant. With regard to the bathtub, it drains nicely.  Very nice rooms. My pillow was too plump for me, but my husband had a nice feather pillow which i might have taken had I known! Just a very nice place so dont let the reviews fool you.  It was perfect!
I have to give this place 3 stars I would have given them 5 starts but it just had to be 3. When booking my Appoinment I requested a king size bed. I was going with my wife so we a king would be perfect. When checking in the guy who helped us have us a room with two queen beds and said all other rooms were taken! Mm hello I booked my room 1 month in advance. Yet what was funny is that a couple next to us managed to get a king size bed....I thought they were all taken? Anyways he said he would contact me the next morning so we could switch rooms. Did they call? Nope. I asked for clean towels and it's like I never called. The rooms are nice. The beds are very comfortable although we had to share a queen. I like that they have fast food restaurants. They even have coffee in the rooms for guest and they don't charge you. I just don't like the staff.
Ok...so I understand about the construction as they are upgrading the surroundings, but come on.  No WiFi in the rooms above 2,3???  So I am there for work and have to wake up at 6:30am....but they have construction starting at what seemed like 4...augh!!!. . I go down and ask for a room change and the person at the desk is quick to change me...very nice.  looks at the room I will be staying in and says that this one should work as it is away from the construction and over looks the pool.  I think cool...quiet.  Nope, I am over seeing the lower level of the casino which has all the fans working...augh!!  Oh well at least this room has a good shower head...the other one sucked.. . What made this stay (8 days) decent was the valet and how they handle themselves...very nice and professional.. . doubt that I will be back.
Hmmm. The room was advertised at $42, the hotel charged $25 extra for "using the amenities", i.e. for nothing. That is 59% higher. Think about it before you book. They are cheating on the price. Where else?. . No breakfast. . No Wi-Fi. Pure and simple, no Wi-Fi. They offer a wired connection, for the said $25. My iPad can't connect over the wire, so I stayed without internet.. . Construction noise.. Rooms are oldish and small, so are the beds.. . My recommendation is obvious... stay away from Monte Carlo. Las Vegas is too big and gorgeous. Find something new in it!
I stayed here the weekend before Christmas so room prices were discounted. The check in was pleasant and the staff  were nice including those who refresh the rooms every day.  Also, the tram was really convenient. I know it is an old hotel and prepared for that.  I have two main issues:  the first is the strong smell of smoke. As soon as you enter the hotel, it just violates the olfactory senses that I could only stay for an hour to gamble there.  I took the tram to Aria to check out their tables and slots every night. My next issue is the wifi (floors 1-3) yet it was included in the hotel amenities charge.  No wifi in floor 30 where we were located.  Also when we checked out, we thought printing the boarding pass was included in the amenities fee but it still asked for a credit card.   . . The human experience is why I'm giving 3 stars to this hotel. All the staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful. But management should seriously consider the wifi connections being offered and some system for improving the smokiness in the gaming area all through the lobby.
Haven't stayed here for couple of years (after the fire sometime ago). We booked this for cheap, with tax n resort fee (we never use the gym and pool, but oh well), came out to like 70 bucks/nite, which was alright considering the X'Mas holiday.. So far as good. The ONLY gripe I have..... No WIFI.....the heck? 2015 just around the corner, who still lugs their Lappie and use RJ45?
Room is kinda boring and basic. It's just the usual small two queen room with a tv and a restroom. Nothing out of the normal. Other hotel rooms here in Vegas look way more grand than this. There is an open case of Ferero rocher left here and the coffee maker also wasn't cleaned out. Will not be returning.
Room was outdated and gross. We will not stay again
The Monte Carlo is in a prime spot on the strip. It smelled like suntan lotion on the casino floor, but that's not really their fault. They have ample entertainment and food options from the food court to really expensive Andre restaurants. I really wanted to go into the frozen bar, but we had a Blue Man Group show to attend (which was awesome). We were here on Christmas, and unfortunately for us many of their eating establishments were closed, though we couldn't be upset by it. They had great holiday decorations in the front of the casino facing the strip.. . All in all, not a bad place, but also indistinguishable from all of the other surrounding casino/hotels next to it.
The place was nice and the area it's in is convenient. The rooms are smaller than previous places I've stayed. The shower nozzle was crappy. Felt like the pressure was way to high, felt crappy like a navy ship shower. Our bathroom door had a crack on door handle as if someone kicked it open. . The place is okay but not sure I would stay again
The worst hotel I have ever stayed. . . Old facility, irresponsible front desk and rude/lazy maintenance people.. . Not helpful and lying without any ground.. . Don't even pick up the phone at the front desk manager level. All they wanna do is keeping u waiting and waiting!. . Security people is just like fake, requested for new keys, never gave the keys to u. The disaster happened twice per nite! Horrible horrible . . Definitely not gonna stay here any more and forever! . . Horrible place and 120% not recommend or u'll regret ur decision
Poor service is what you can expect from the Monte Carlo hotel from beginning to end. After being in a plane for several hours you get to stand in a line for about 15 minutes before you get to check in. It wasn't that I came in at a bad time because every time I passed by the front desk, the line to get in was about the same length. . . When I finally got to the front of the line & checked in I asked for a wake-up call, but the check in desk told I had to use the phone in my room to set it up. I don't know about you, but, I do not like my first experience with a hotel being someone saying "it's not my job.". . On my second night, I needed a pen to fill out rental-return form for the car I rented. Every hotel I have ever stayed at has always put a pen or two in the room--not the Monte Carlo. I looked everywhere in that room & I found not one pen.. . During my entire stay, the cleaning staff did not replace the soap in my room once. On the third day, they even took the bath soap I had been using out of the room but did not replace it. I had to catch a one of the cleaning ladies in another room to get another bar of soap to last for the rest of my stay.. . I did not need it, but the hotel only has Wi-Fi on the first two floors. Although the check in desk is open 24 hours, the concierge desk is not. If you problem in your room after it closed & you want to talk to a hotel representative in person, you would be out of luck--unless you want to wait through the check in line & have them tell you it's not their job. I have stayed in hotels in the middle of nowhere, where the town closes down at 8.p.m. but the hotel had Wi-Fi & a 24 hour concierge.. . I am telling all my friends not just to stay away from the Monte Carlo but also all the MGM hotels on the strip.
Been staying here for 2 days now. It's a nice place but I won't be staying here ever again here's why. It's so noisy! I can hear everything my neighbors do. Conversations, TV, general movement and bathroom activities. I'm not picky and I know you don't come to Vegas to hang out in your room but it's annoying to come back after being out all day to hear a strangers conversation through your wall. I want a room that I can recharge and relax. So Monte Carlo does not fulfill that for me.
I am currently a guest here.  My husband, and I , and our 2 young children always stay at the Luxor but we decided to come here so that it would be closer to the strip and I heard it was a better hotel. I was seriously lied to. We frequent Vegas approximately every 6-8 weeks and I am shocked at this hotel called Monte Carlo. From being the first one in line to check in....only to wait 10 minutes because all of the female check in clerks were staring at their computer screens and not acknowledging our existence. Thankfully two men at the end noticed me and my young family and waved me down to them. Funny how management just walked behind these ladies and did not care to ask us how we were doing or if we had been helped.  Seriously though.....10 minutes to close up the last customers....or were they staring at Facebook or Tinder? Either way, i waited. Then comes today. We asked the nice bell staff if the hot tub was open because my children and I would love to relax in it. We waited and waited and waited, for approx 7 minutes, to hear back the big answer of YES. Seems like the ppor bell staff was waiting forever to hear back from a pool attendant.  So we went to our room, dressed in our swimsuits....only to be told by a front desk agent that it is $10.00 per guest to use the hot tub...even if we are paying to stay here. WTF????? I can handle the rude front desk. I can handle the lack of communication from the bell desk from the other areas of the hotel. But to charge a paying guest $10.00 to use a hot tub is stupid. WONT BE BACK. Monte Carlo has the worst reputation for a reason. Well, they are one step ahead of HOOTERS!!!!!!
Checked in on Friday, December 26 - Checked out Monday December 29.. I will never ever stay here again.  Our restroom was gross!!! Mildew all around the tub, the wall was falling apart.... Towels that were there were stained with black and to top it off our bathroom sink was clogged!! No point calling to complain was left on hold forever.  I will never stay at this hotel and I would not recommend to any, you would think for being a hotel right on the strip it would be up to date however NOPE!
Do not stay here unless you want blood on your sheets PRIOR to checking in. UNACCEPTABLE. WILL NOT PAY THIS MUCH FOR A "6 star hotel."
