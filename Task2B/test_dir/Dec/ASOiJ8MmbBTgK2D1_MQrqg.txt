The service is phenomenal, the half avocado with crab is amazing, definitely recommend it. A good drink to order is called autumn in Paris but use kettle one instead of grey goose vodka
We just ate here tonight. All around amazing! The table and view were awesome. My boyfriend and I both ordered the salad and it was great. I ordered the salmon which was the best salmon I have ever had - so delicious. My boyfriend ordered the beef Wellington and potatoes Anna which were both great. We had the chocolate souffle for desert and holy cow - amazing. Overall a wonderful experience for our date night!
One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!  Will return next visit.  Had excellent service.
Came here for my anniversary as a surprise dinner. It was a wonderful experience. . We started with salad and soup and they were great! The complimentary starter and bread basket were a great surprise! . Service is friendly and timely. . We had great suggestions from our server. I had fish and it was cooked to perfection. . I highly recommend the chocolate souffle. Order it in advance as it takes a while to prepare. . A little pricey but a wonderful ambience and great experience. Very romantic!
Wanted to try this restaurant at lunch time with the hubby while in Vegas. When you arrive in the Paris Hotel you take a special elevator --inside the hotel--to the restaurant. There was a nice lady and gentlemen by the elevator door that retrieved the restaurant elevator for us. When we made it to the top we were greeted at the hostess stand and immediately seated. Our waiter came by very nonchalantly and handed us the short lunch menu. I asked could we sit in the middle of the restaurant but for some reason they had to fill all of the seats around the edges. What????! The restaurant wasn't even full and it was lunch time. After reviewing the menu, the hubby and I decided that we didn't want anything to eat (nothing looked appealing) but we would stay and have a glass of wine. When I informed the waiter he said we could not sit at the table to just have a drink and we had to go to the bar and he proceeded to retrieve our menus. I had enough of this wanna be restaurant by then and the hubby and I left. I was not impressed.
This was an excelent meal, albeit much overpriced. The service was great, the server spoke French, English, and German (and God knows what else) so I spoke to her in German, just to match the cost of the food.. . My partner and I ordered the tasting menu with the wine paring. Bothwere almost flawless until the main meat course, which sucked my donkey's ass (some chef experiments aren't meant to be charged for). . . We began with an amuse bush of three small items including lobster, sausage, and cured vegies. Our first course was a raw scallop appitizer. This was my favorite course of the evening. After that we had a delicious seared fish followed by the main meat couse which was a tenderloin of venison with a spice rub. The venison was totally overpowered by the rub, which tasted so strong it was almost like powdered pine needles (I am thinking, pepper, star anise, cloves, allspice, and maybe thyme). We packed that in a box to eat later, which I tried to do but gagged every time until I threw it away.. . The desert course was lovely, I recall it being a chocolate mouse which my partner gobbled up as her favorite course of the night.. . The wine pairing flowed nicely and in fact so nicely that I gave my partner my last three glasses, and she got sexily buzzed.. . The best thing about the evening besides the service was the view. We sat sat right at the window in the middle of the fake Eiffel Tower, overlooking the Bellagio wather show, which we got to see multiple times. . . It was a lovely dinner (except for the venision which was like a poop in the punchbowl) and then proceeded to our hotel room for some after-the-culinary-orgy exercise.. . A very nice night - at the cost of $450 for two of us.
What an amazing view.  The wait staff here is outstanding.  The only reason there is not 5 stars here is I had to literally send back my steak 2x because it was over cooked.   The waiter was visibly mortified and took care of us, however, by the time my meal arrived the other was cold.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you have the chance to visit and hopefully the kitchen gets it right one the first go.  You will need a healthy budget, however it's worth it for a romantic dinner.
My fiance took me here to celebrate my finishing grad school.  I was so excited for this place and thought we would have a quiet, romantic meal looking over the strip.  . . We know it was going to be expensive so the sticker shock wasn't as bad for us.  We each ordered a main dish, a side, and 1 drink.  This was about $75 each person.  We passed on sweets because we were both full.  . . The food was really good and my wine was delicious. The view was good.  We were sitting to the side against the window so had great views.  . . My biggest complaint was that the tables were small.  I felt very cramped.  When I went to stand up I felt that I was hitting everything/anybody around me.  I also felt like I was sitting on top of the person at the table next to me.  I know they do this to maximize guests who can be there at the same time but I felt it took away from the ambiance of the restaurant/experience.
Service is excellent.  I had foie gras.  It was delicious.  The duck was perfectly done.  The lobster medallion appetizer was very good as was the roast chicken.  The warm Ceasar salad was unique.   All in all an A plus dinner and worth the cost.  Ask for Tom and Carlos to wait on you as they are a team.
We originally came justto have some dessert and coffee but after walking around in Vegas, we worked up and appetite (added to this exercise, the windy chill in the air). It's a decent excuse right?!. . We asked the elevator operator if we can go up and check out the view. We walked into the kitchen (I want this kitchen) then entered the dining room. We asked the hostess if we could just get a seat for some dessert and coffee and we were led to this table that overlooked the Bellagio Fountain. After thinking it over we decided to get something to nosh on.. . We ordered:. . Artichoke crepe. French onion soup. Berry souffle. Bora bora (non alcoholic drink for princess. . Complimentary was the:. Cauliflower chilled soup. Chocolates and candy. Bread (of course). . I have no words to describe the food and hope that you will decide after seeing pictures.. . Did I mention the fountain show?!. . The service here is absolutely top notch as well.
A little kitchy, but a very fun experience and the food was quite good. I loved the attendant in the ladies bathroom - I just wish I had known about her so I could bring $ to tip her. . . We did not have dessert because we were late for our show (not the restaurants fault, our fault), next time I will be ordering a souffle - they looked amazing!
Beautiful location and view. . My mother in law had the cream of onion soup and the stuffed French toast. Both were amazing. . I had the foie gras appetizer and it was very creamy. . Service was top notch and the crusty bread can't be beat anywhere!
First walking in: you see a magnificent kitchen with focused culinary artists paying attention to every detail of the food.. . Then, you wait for the host to tell you there's no window seats available though the restaurant just opened. You are puzzled and confused. You wait 30 minutes for the table and the host skips you because you're dad is the only one of your party there but you left for the bathroom. (A rule I've never heard before) You're forced to awkwardly ask for a window seat again. Finally, while making friendly chit chat with the  hostess, you get what you want... . You take selfies for da memoriez but you have waiters and waitresses giving you major stink eye.. . The water show at the Bellagio starts and it's the most exciting thing.. . Soon, the server comes to offer a great arrangement of breads with butter and a palette cleanser.. . Your waiter comes up to you right after and expects you to have a decision. You don't and you are rushed to order. The waiter is very annoyed and walks away. So you feel unwelcomed..... . The waiter comes a second time. We all order something different. He leaves. As he comes back around, you want to change your order to salmon instead of chicken. He tells you, "No, I already ordered chicken in the kitchen." You say oh okay never mind :). And the waiter dashes off in a hasty fashion. You don't get it, that something easily changable. Honestly you would go to the kitchen and change it yourself if you could.. . You receive your food with stunning presentation, everything cooked to a T, it was quite the instagram meal to go with the view. (I recommend not ordering the caesar salad because it doesn't look so appealing as an actual meal). You were enjoying every bite but your dad didn't like his chicken. He told our, so far, degenerate waiter that he wasn't expecting shards of bones and grissle in the chicken. Waiter said, "Well it's not supposed to be boneless" your dad says,"I know but I wasn't expecting shards of bone and grissle I was expecting a breast" and the waiter says,"Oh okay." And dashes off once again. I thought he would at least apologize. The restaurant is VERY dimmly lit so reading the menu for someone with bad eye sight is HARD. Especially when half is in french and some ingradients are things you've never even heard of.. . From that rude encounter, you knew this waiter already did not like your family because they didn't choose to order the first time and he really just wants us to go away. You don't think they've had any strange requests or rude remarks. They're just a bunch of awkward, quiet folk over here.. . This waiter decides to have happy chit chats with all the other customers around you and runs past your table every single time, which is kind of distracting from the magnificent view! Not like you wanted to ask anything more from him anyway. . . It's a great place to take pictures with family. So You brought your selfie stick and cellphone. And your dad brought his camera. They would get up by the window on occasion to take pictures with the Bellagio fountain. Meanwhile, that waiter would sit in the dark corner and GLARESat u having a good time. AND HE WOULD TALK ABOUT U WITH OTHER WAITERS. It's really ridiculous now. Clearly he don't want a tip. And you have to admit your family stayed there shorter than both tables beside them and they were quiet people. They definitely rubbed this waiter the wrong way but not for him to turn all middle schooler on us, damn!. . I decided to be nice to him. When he collected our plates and uneasily offered us dessert. I smiled at him and acted very pleased. And he actually asked us where we were from and I said the Bay Area. And he said Aw California. And he dropped the menus and walked away.... Okay..  . We ordered the eiffel tower chocolate plate. AMAZING. Best thing there. They must do dessert very well!. . The waiter comes by right when we finished and collects my plate and leaves the bill as so expected, very unwelcoming.. . Basically, we paid for the spot. and like many others we stayed there for a little while longer. We soak in the breathtaking sight: the fountains, the lights, the dimmly lit room!. . We began to leave and so expected. The waiter is glaring at us again, pointing us out to his waiter buddies. It takes a while to put on my coat and scarf and he intends to just keep staring at my family and I. I hope this time he was staring at us because he noticed no tip on the table.... . The management clearly cannot stand the type that aren't fancy and high class. My waiter deeply disliked us for no real reason other than maybe we embodied some aspects of bad customers before. But I believe he deserved the no tip left on the badly cleaned table. Leaving on a positive note, the restaurant has an excellent taste for any savory or sweet dishes. All foods are creamy and I absolutely love that! The view is everything! Just be aware of SNOBBY WAITERS and HOSTS.
Me: Party of two. Hostess: What's your name?. Me: I didn't make a reservation.. Hostess: We'll get you a table ASAP.. Me: How long do I have to wait?. Hostess: ASAP.. . Can you guess where this is heading? My girlfriend and I waited for 30 minutes and I asked the hostess again how long we have to wait. After going into a whole discussion, now she tells me that all tables are booked and we are there to wait indefinitely to fill in the gap when someone cancels his reservation. She says this is the definition of ASAP and I was too dumb to understand what it meant.
