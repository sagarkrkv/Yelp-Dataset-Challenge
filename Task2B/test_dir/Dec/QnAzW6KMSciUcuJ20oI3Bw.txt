So I come to Az several times a year. Being from Chicago, where we have the best restaurants in country, it's hard to find GOOD food. I would give their food 5 stars, but their service and cleanliness no stars!!! I was there last night with my wife and we ordered the food. It was cool outside so we sat inside, but we could not find a clean table. When I asked one of the girls if she could wipe down some of the tables, she reached under the count and pulled out a towel from a bucket of water and handed it to me! I was so stunned, I did wipe the table. The floor is littered with paper napkins and food! There was a half slice of piece of bread under our table. Now our order was done, except I ordered ribs, they where good and pork combo. They ran out of pork, so the same girl who handed me the rag, told me they are making more and. She will bring it out to me. She never did. Regardless of how good the food is here, in Chicago, the city would shut this place down for uncleaniness. hope the owner reviews this and addresses these problems, as the food was very good and has the possibility of being an excellent place it managed properly.
Even though you will more than likely have to stand in a decent line to order, it's always worth the wait! The food is great, the outdoor grassy area with large picnic tables are so charming, and it is so pet and kid friendly! . Love the burgers and pizza! Have heard awesome things about the bbq too! So much fun for my nieces to run around after eating. There will more than likely be an abundance of kids playing together as it's almost like picnicking at a park when you come here for lunch. . Overall such a unique, delicious and charming place, bravo!
Still always love this screwball restaurant (don't miss the bathroom attractions, for instance), and think it's worth the 66 mile round trip from my house to come enjoy the whole scene here!  Today I was joined by Robyn N., Mike C. & Jackie R.. . I ordered my usual, a  "Fontina Burger," one of the world's great hamburgers!  It's made with extra tasty meat, roasted diced red peppers, grilled mushrooms, lettuce, tomato slices, pickle, onions, farm-made pecan pesto & Fontina cheese, all piled up on a special bun.  For a side this time I had their great Onion Rings, & to be sure & overdo it, added a Chocolate Malt.  Then, to REALLY blow the diet, we all went over to "The Coffee Shop" next door on the farm for dessert.     :-)). . Fontina Burger & Fries $9.49, upgrade to Onion Rings (from among several no-extra-cost options) $2.50, Chocolate Malt $4.49.  YUM!
Great and greasy! The food is good as long as you aren't on a diet. The cattle call line is somewhat more acceptable here at a burger joint than at his other two places. . . I have found it very crowded at times so be careful when you choose to show up. Love the Salt Cedar trees in the outside eating area.
The location is excellent! Lots of big trees and shades. . The food is quite good. I tried the Fontina burger and it was both delicious and full-filling. I loved the grilled mushrooms and their green sauce (?). The burger came with a side of fries, too. . The service was self-served. You could sit inside or outside. Great view. . Would definitely recommend it to anyone.
Decided to return here as I wanted something different for lunch. I was looking for a Sonoran dog. JFG has that covered. I paired that with some garlic fries. It was busy but only a 5 minute line. Somehow I managed to stay under $10 which was a pleasant surprise considering my last experience. The fries were good but I think GB is better for that. The dog was very good and filling, glad I didn't get a double. JFG will stay on my list just not top 10.
Two of us spent $33 for dinner and we got a hamburger and a fish special. The food was only mediocre. It turns out that the hamburger is cooked to rare. Apparently the menu says that but I didn't see it. The hamburger was red and slimy inside. I can't imagine how it passed the Health Department regulations for temperature. The fried Zucchini was not crisp. The shrimp were actually too big and just uninspired.  The fries were not tasty. I like the McDonalds or Burger King fries a lot better. Having said the above, we did like the cod and the cole slaw. Needless to say we were unimpressed and will not be back.
Every year Joe does a customer appreciation meal which brings out long lines that are worth it. Delicious hamburgers and plenty of outside seating to enjoy, especially during the spring and winter months. Beautiful gigantic trees provide plenty of shade. Kid's meals include a sucker.
I got the Carolina Dog and swapped out the french fries for Sweet Potato Fries.  The dog was good, very messy but the pork had great flavor. I was extremely surprised at how small the portion of Sweet Potato fries was.  It was $2 more to change to the Sweet Potato fries and I literally got about 20 fries.  They were delicious but definitely not worth the extra cost.  We each got a sandwich and upgraded our sides, he got a shake and our total was $30!  It is decent food, and a quaint atmosphere outside but the prices leave much to be desired.
Great food but pricey. Was excited to go there for my birthday and have to say the staff ruined it. We called ahead to see if they had pizza (the only thing there my little one will eat there) and were told they did. When we got there 20 minutes later were told they that no pizza and were all but laughed at when we explained we even called ahead and were told they did. No offer to help and no manager to be found. Huge disappointment and epic fail for the staff and their condescending attitude.
This place is right by our house... Amazing food. Tastes like they pulled it fresh outta their farm the same morning!. . Literally you can taste the dirt in the food... And it's great!
