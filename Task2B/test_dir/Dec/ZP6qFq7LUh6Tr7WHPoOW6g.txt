Golden brown pancakes, best pancakes in Vegas. Beats the pants off of chains like IHop and Denny's. I also had a side of chived smashed potatoes, also very good.  Service was excellent. . . Warning: They do not have sugar free syrup! I was eating here post workout, so I didn't mind having the simple sugar from their pure maple syrup. This is a great spot. Would make the drive to eat here again.
Came to Eat. for the time today. Best damn Corned Beef Hash I ever had!!! No beignets though, sad :-( Great atmosphere, service was great!!
Hands down the best meal and value I ate in Vegas during my two days. It's a simple spot with all the yummy, wholesome and perfectly crafted good you could ask for. My shrimp and grits was perfection. The bacon they use (in my meal and a few others on my table) was the best I've had in ages. They didn't charge for soda water, which I always order and hate being charged for. Loved this place and we went to container park when we were don't. Downtown is really coming along and I hope this spot will stills be in business when I make it back
I had breakfast at the bar here one beautiful Sunday morning. I had the pancakes with bacon. I didn't realize how large the pancakes were going to be. It was so good that I didn't wan to stop eating them. The bacon was cooked to perfection. It's a nice little place and awesome for people watching which I love to do. I will be returning. This may just become my favorite breakfast spot.
I was in town for work and was looking for a breakfast spot before some client meetings.  Eat was right around the corner from my first meeting and the place was great.  I had the huevos motulenos and it had a little bit of spice but just the right amount.  The staff was great and I love the location that Eat is in.  It's in old Las Vegas and there is a lot of cool happenings here.
I enjoying supporting a small business ESP a Downtown business.  Super clean, super cute, really hip!  Pancakes Yumma but not worth the price but I'm. Sure rent is crazy expensive.  They have charging outlets by every still at front counter to charge while you play on UR device and eat or sip coffee!
I can't seem to get away from ordering the chicken fried steak! The gravy with it is awesome. Now if you have a large party the service may seem slow but the food you get is worth it! Another highlight is the strawberry puree, which goes with your toast, pancakes, hell you could put that on anything and it would taste amazing. . . I've had the corned beef hash and eggs and they are great aswell and my friend ordered the eggs benedict and she really enjoyed them aswell. They have healthy alternatives if you require that for your diet.
The food and service are always great.  I love the small owned business and how the restaurant is managed.  I'm very impressed with the recipes and how they are plated.  I would recommend this breakfast place to anyone in the valley.  Go downtown and support this local business!  Try any of the benny's they are my fave!
My friend and I have been looking forward to coming here for weeks. We finally make it out for Sunday brunch and were extremely disappointed. We waited about 20 mins for a table which isn't bad. The decor is really cool, modern, and has a good vibe. . Service is horrible. No one smiles or introduces themselves. A guy take our drink  order, a women comes takes our order. Neither of the servers are pleasant or friendly.  I let her know that I would like to order a sandwich to go toward the end of the meal. Food comes out quickly. . My friend got the grilled cheese with avocado. It's average. The passion ice tea is really good. My eggs Benedict is drowning in the hollandaise sauce. I can't even enjoy all the ingredient bc the sauce is taking over the plate. I look around and others have egg Benedict's who have a lot less sauce than us, and even strawberries in their plate!  . The check is dropped while I'm still eating. Uncomfortable. I never get to order my sandwich to go bc the server honestly never really came back. Sure I could've got her attention but at this point i would take my business else where.. The cherry on top is I asked if the orange juice was fresh squeezed. The guy tells me yes. I ordered a small and it's definitely not fresh squeezed. I am charged for a large. I don't even bother to correct the $6.00 mistake. I'm just so over it at this point.
Friendly service & BOMB food!! I'll drive downtown to Eat anytime it's totally worth it!
This place is awesome and just what I like...nice place, not too expensive, and offering food with unique twists/additions than the usual or outright inventions. . . The coffee is awesome. Drink the coffee. I haven't eaten chicken fried steak in about a decade but that's what was calling my name. It seems like that is the biggest breakfast and just what I needed: a massive piece of chicken fried steak with sausage gravy dumped on top, plus some eggs, plus some potatoes, plus some mongo thick sourdough toast! Awesome! . . My frau got the truffled egg sandwich and I had a bite of that - delicious! We went on a Saturday around noonish with a party of four and were seated in about 10 minutes. No complaints about the service - everyone was nice and chipper.
Me and my boyfriend went on a weekday. Not too busy with a good vibe! Waitress and hostess were very nice. Healthy option menu. He got the dwblta and added an egg. It came with a tomato soup which was equally bomb. I ordered the truffled egg sandwich, hold the shrooms. Was probably the best scramby egg sandwich I ever had. Potatoes I weren't crazy about but that's ok. Loved this place. Would go back again.
Eat was good.  . . Pro-Portions aplenty, quality was amazing.  I recommend the country friend steak because of the hearty portion. (5 stars for food). . Con-we were only 3 people, but we wait 45 minutes to be seated.  We arrived at 11:30 am, Sunday. (3 stars service)
Good food, good service, big price tag.. . Basedon waiter's recommendation I had the corned beef hash with cheddar cheese this morning. It was simply delicious and the added cheddar cheese was a good recommendation. The two poached eggs were of differing doneness though: one was a little runny and the other boiled hard. I am not sure how that happens unless they were prepared separately or the eggs were of different age. Coffee was good and constantly topped off. I am just not entirely sure that a single breakfast dish and coffee should run $20+ with tip.. . Parking on the street is $1/hr by parking space number at the automatic meters.
Things my boyfriend has said about the truffled egg sandwich:. "Fking amazing". "Legendary". "This is the greatest breakfast sandwich of all time". "I can't even believe this is real". "This sandwich needs an award". . We've been here four weekends in a row
Wow, another amazing find in Las Vegas that's off the strip and well worth the visit! Went here for lunch and the place was packed with only a few tables open. There were a lot of locals, which immediately made me feel like we made a good choice. We didn't have to wait as the hostess happily seated us near the kitchen (which by the way is open, so that was fun). We ordered drinks and then placed our order with a friendly waiter. I chose the "killer" grilled cheese with tomato soup and my boyfriend had the BLT with avocado. They both came out of the kitchen in record time... we were not expecting them to be so quick, especially with a packed house! Both dishes were amazing. The bread is to die for! It really made the sandwiches. I loved both dishes (had to sample) but I will say the BLT may have been the winner. It was also served with homemade chips that were especially good. The prices were also refreshing to someone who has been gouged by restaurants up and down Las Vegas Boulevard. A new "must visit" in this city for lunch!
Great food! I really enjoyed my truffled egg sandwich. My husband had the dish that was kind of like breakfast nachos and wasn't wowed, but liked it. The service was good, although our server was replaced by someone else with no explanation (her shift was over??). But both servers were very nice and friendly. I liked the decor which has a very trendy/industrial feel. . With two dishes and one coffee it was probably the most expensive breakfast I've ever had at $40 (including tip).
I'm two years late to the party, but I finally ate at Eat. A few weeks ago, my husband was downtown on business and called me up asking for a recommendation for lunch. I told him to try Eat. Afterward, he told me about the awesome blta w/ egg sandwich he had. He took me to check it out the day of the Santa Run, but the santas kept us from getting to Carson and 7th so I'd have to wait to try Eat. Then, last week; success! . . If driving be prepared to feed the parking meter. The restaurant sits on the lower level of Park Avenue Apartments. This tired building is sure to experience a revitalization thanks to the Downtown Project. Carson Ave has become a hot spot for downtown dining and it began with Natalie Young's Eat. She was the first to partner with Tony Hsieh and see her dream to fruition. She is currently working on her next venture, Chow. . . Eat bustled on a late Saturday morning, while there was no line out the door. There was a wait for a table, but counter seating was available. We settled in and gazed over the menu. Our server asked, "Can I get cinnamon biscuits started for you?" Many might be duped by the question thinking they are complimentary, only to be surprised later by an $8 charge on the bill. It is a bit sneaky so be warned. Yet, we said, "yes, bring them on!" The tender biscuits swim in strawberry compote and are topped with berries. It reminds me very much of strawberry shortcake, add some fresh whipped cream and it'd be the perfect dessert. . . When it came to ordering we skipped right over the breakfast items and went straight for the sandwiches. I had to try the dwblta ($11) myself and the husband went for the killer grilled cheese with tomato soup ($9). During the week more sandwiches are available, they all sound fantastic. However, if I ever get a chance to dine on a weekday, the chilaquiles will be mine! . . I added cheese to my dwblta, I skipped the egg; I don't dig runny eggs, blasphemy, I know. This sandwich was great! All components married beautifully and the sourdough bread held it together without being too bready. It was a thing of beauty, truly. Sandwiches come with a side of house chips, potato or tomato salad. I really enjoyed the tomato salad. Despite my best efforts I could only devour half of the sandwich. I took the rest home. This sandwich could easily be shared. . . He added tomato, egg, and avocado to the killer grilled cheese. It was a tasty twist, especially when dipped in the soup. However, as good as it was we agreed we enjoyed the dwblta a bit more. In fact, it might just be the best damn sandwich in lv.
NAIL -----+ HEAD!!!. . Thank you, eat.!. . When one is stuck in the saddest place is the world that is Las Vegas, one's skin might crawl. Mine actually itches. eat was such a pleasant respite from the strip mall hell that is most of that town, and it really brings it with the food and the atmosphere.. . --Great music playing that's not too loud.. . --Fantastic food with something for everyone (and generous portion sizes like the rest of this town).. . --We had the truffled egg sandwich minus bacon (hey people, if one doesn't get bacon can you PLEASE add something else or take off some money?!), the arugula/asparagus salad, and a side of cheesy grits. Everything was delicious, and the home fries that come with the egg sandwich are actually REAL home fries, as in, crisped and tossed with onion. We saw a number of delicious-looking menu items gets sent out from our counter/kitchen-view seats. The housemade veggie burger looked particularly amazing too.. . --Also, coffee!! The first/only decent coffee I had on the whole trip, and you can get Sugar in the Raw.. . --Leftovers NOT packed in styrofoam!! Hallelujah! While the rest of Las Vegas attempts to kill the environment and the humans in it at every turn, here at eat you can get leftovers packed in paper!. . We had counter seats with a view (and ear) to the kitchen. We figured out why there are so many complaints about service. It is slow and inconsistent, and frequently there were up to 8 meals ready to go out to tables, but servers weren't taking them as fast as the kitchen was working. Also, for some reason, instead of table numbers or seat numbers, one person would say "This is for the heavyset gentleman in the hat over there" rather than "This is table 11." Very odd. . . Our service was fine, and we weren't in a hurry but I hope if any owner/manager reads this you'll take the service complaints to heart. They seem valid. Also, vegetarians really hate having to ask for a left-off ingredient like bacon, prosciutto, sausage (things with an upcharge) but not getting offered something for a sub or $1 off.. . If I ever have to return to the saddest place in the world I will eat here at least once.
Great food. Great service. Egg truffle sandwich was amazing. Definitely coming back when we're in Vegas.
I've been here twice now and what a great addition to downtown! They've a variety of breakfasts items like chicken fried steak and chilaquiles along with a delicious bacon and egg sandwich with feta on ciabatta as well as your standard bacon and eggs. I've also had the roast beef sandwich and a nice salad with shrimp. The breakfast items are all great while the lunch items were good. That combined with a slightly high price point keep this from being 5 stars in my book but don't let that deter you. Check this place out!!!
Tried out Eat. because we saw it on Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown Vegas episode and we were there on Wed morning early so it was easy to get a table.  Street parking in the front is meter, but around the corner where we parked is residential apartments.. . It's a hipster kind of place, people are friendly and they give good service.. . We got:. . Tap water - FREE. . 1 coffee $3 - she kept asking if we wanted it refilled and even if we wanted a cup to go.. . B. got a full size bowl of green chile chicken posole $9 - it's a huge bowl we shared.  Soup was tasty enough, chicken dry.. . I got Arugula salad $10 - even at 9am you can get salad.  I wanted it for fiber since when we travel we don't eat enough greens.  It was tasty enough.. . Our total with tax $23.78 but before tip.. . Separate bathrooms available.
Good food - kind of expensive - convenient to Fremont street - and don't miss the park across the street.
Still Don't Understand the Hype. . I ordered the huevos motulenos.  It was barely edible.  I should have gone with something else because apparently there must be a better dish than what I had ordered.  My co-diner enjoyed her grill cheese sandwich, which I've eaten before (really greasy, but that's what you expect).  All I can muster for this place is - "yep."  I won't be going back for breakfast again.
I sooooo love the good here...and would usually give it 5stars..... . But today I sat at the "community table" and observed how long it took to be served (after someone had to tell out a table # to server...I believe it was 25 or 45)..:then I was finally seen, asked for a drink and I was already ready to order. . . Got my meal super fast which was great, but then never had a refill on my water...ever...or asked for a refill.. . Then I had to out out my CC in hopes to signal I was ready to pay...yes...that signal worked...A FEW mins later I was given my bill...again never asked for any more water tho.. . I've usually come on the weekends and maybe it's more relaxed then, or maybe I just need to sit at a table from now on....who knows but definitely not impressed by service today. . . Food 5star, service 1star...makes it a 3.
its no hash house a go go but the food was just as good.
Really great breakfast place near Fremont Street. Awesome ingredients, great presentation and delicious flavors. Super positive energy here too. Not cheap but worth it. See you in the flowers.. . P.S. There's a cool shipping container architecture styled shopping park across the street too.
My favorite place to eat breakfast downtown.. . Everything we've eaten here was all good.. . - Golden-brown pancakes with chicken apple sausage and maple syrup. - Shrimp and grits - smoked bacon, two over easy eggs, pico de gallo. - Truffled Egg Sandwich. - Green chile chicken posole. . In particular, the crispy outer texture of the pancakes was just perfect, my wife's new favorite. All other items were great, too.
Originally went to Dennys down the street, but was closed due to their water was not working. So my boyfriend started browsing through Yelp and foundthis gem! It's absolutely DELICIOUS!!! We are from Southern California and visit Las Vegas pretty often. You bet we will be coming for breakfast from now on whenever we are in town. . . Service was great as well :)
A little out of the way from most vacationer's way but that's what I love about Eat. It's not what I call trendy but definitely seems like it's in an up and coming part of vegas that really appears to appeal to locals and tourists (if you are smart enough to do your homework). The food portions are substantial and taste is above average. Though I have to say they are far superior in the way of service. Everyone is super nice and attentive but with a laid back style I appreciate. This is the place to be if you are looking for that unique find off strip.
