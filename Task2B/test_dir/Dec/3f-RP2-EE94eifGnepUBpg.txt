This show is surprisingly very good.. . My wife and I saw a Cirque du Soleil show a few years ago and I didn't like it at all. I hated the goofy, slapstick comedy and while I can admire the gymnasts' ability to do what they do, it wasn't my thing. I vowed 'never again'. But we got a deal on the tickets this time and I'm also a Beatles fan, so I figured if I hated the show I could at least enjoy the music. I ended up liking both.. . For Beatles LOVE, the comedy and goofy shtick are downplayed and the performers play it straight. At the same time, the show doesn't take itself very seriously either, which is a good thing. I still have no idea what the show is about or if it even follows a narrative of any kind. It's a 90-minute mash-up of heavily re-mixed Beatles songs and acrobatics. Each sequence of the show seems to vaguely follow the mood of whatever piece of music it's set to. The performers aren't trying to provide a literal interpretation of the lyrics so much as they're just reacting to the mood or tone of the songs. For example, "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" is a colourful song, filled with lots of theatrical and circus references so the performers act out a theatrical, circus-y routine.. . If you would like to purchase something from the Beatles LOVE gift shop I HIGHLY recommend shopping there earlier in the day, before there is a performance going on. The store is mobbed with people immediately after the show and you'll be standing in line for a while. The store is not large and it will be quite irritating having to push your way through the crowd to view the merchandise.. . The same goes for the photo ops. Everyone and their dog was waiting to get a picture of themselves beside the silhouettes of John, Paul, George, and Ringo between the theatre and the gift shop when the show was done. Guess how many people are there in the afternoon - none! Pick up your tickets at the box office early in the day (that's right - to avoid the line) and do your shopping and photos at that time. That way when you come see the show all you have to do is show up - then leave.
This was one of the best shows I've ever seen. I love The Beatles, and this show is such a wonderful tribute to their lives and their work. The way the speakers are set up make their music sound completely new and different. If you see one show while you're in Las Vegas, make it this one!
I love the Beatles so I was really excited to see this show. I was not disappointed in the least. I was really impressed by the interpretation of the Beatles songs and the costumes, staging, acoustics, and props were all spectacular. The stage was set up in-the-round so that everyone had a decent view of the stage, and speakers were attached to the heads of each seat for the optimal listening experience. One cool thing that was used in the show were voice recordings of the Beatles talking in the studio. It really showed how much the boys must have had while recording. . . Songs that stood out: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, For the Benefit of Mr. Kite, and Flying/Blue Jay Way? (forgot which one, or both since the tracks were remixed) . . If you have seen Cirque shows before, however, you may be disappointed in the variety of the acts. While they did some other acts, the show seemed really dance and rope-acrobatics heavy. . . Overall, this show was outstanding. It exceed my expectations, and I would recommend it to anyone going to Vegas.
We did not have to pay for tickets and the guy that bought them got a Black Friday deal so we had some decent seats. How can you complain about a free show?. .    The visuals and aerials were incredible. They left me thinking about the performance a week later. The music is from the slower songs by the Beatles. Even though I was familiar with them, my girlfriend was not.  . .    There is so much happening at once that it was easy to become overwhelmed to the point I lost track of the story they were trying to tell; however the stage was specifically built for this act so I concentrated on that and was amazed by just the technical aspects.  There is a behind the scenes tour that I would love to check out.
What can I say that hasn't been said already? It was a really good show. Seems like no matter where you sit, it's a good time. This is tied with absinthe in my book. Must see
I have been studying at the Cirque du Soleil - The Beatles LOVE for 9 months now and cannot see myself taking classes elsewhere. Not only is Todd incredibly observant and knowledgeable, but he represents your biggest motivator and fan in a town where true supporters are hard to come by. And everyone at the studio help in any way they can, becoming friends in the process.  The classes are great for Cirque du Soleil - The Beatles LOVE and sitcom writers as you study what makes jokes work from both sides of the coin, and the different characters on sitcoms you will portray. After only a few classes, you'll know what your "type(s)" is/are and be able to polish your characterization while always maintaining the humor of each scene.  For a fun time and advancement in the industry, I highly recommend Cirque du Soleil - The Beatles LOVE.
Another Cirque masterpiece!. . Top 10 Reasons Why You Should Check Out This Show:. 1) Not exactly a Beatles fan?  Neither WAS I.  Now I am.  . 2) The lighting is absurdly good... otherworldly.  . 3) Probably the most colorful production I have ever seen, and I am a jaded New Yorker who has been fortunate enough to see tons of Broadway shows. . 4) The music almost feels like it was made for this production!. 5) Four words: flying bed on cloud.  Pure magic.  . 6) You could see this show tens of times and always find something new to watch. . 7) This production is massive and lavish!  It is really hard to believe.  . 8) The athleticism is crazy good.  . 9) The costumes and sets are crazy good. . 10) Not just a celebration of the Beatles, but a celebration of life. Prepare to maybe even get a bit choked up.
This is the BEST Cirque show in Vegas!! Any seat is a good one, so don't overspend.  90 minutes of amazing and varied entertainment set to the BEST music.  The show starts out great and climbs from there until you're out of your seat standing and clapping at the end.  Yes, it's pricey--but there are deals if you check Mandalay's website directly, or one of the Vegas ticket deal websites (even Tix4tonight can help.) Don't miss this one--kids and adults will be entertained!
This show is far and away the catchiest, most innovative and hypnotic stage show I have ever seen.  Whether you are a fan of The Beatles or not this show is a MUST SEE in my opinion.  . . The Mirage is home to the spectacle that is LOVE and by having this show performed in the round is absolutely brilliant.  The round stage offers a remarkably good view to all guests no matter what seat you purchase (although their is one minor interactive element exclusive to those who sit closer during the show but I wont spoil it).  The music is prefect and covers songs throughout the entire Beatles catalog of music and the story flows seamlessly throughout.  For those saying this has less high gravity and death defying acts than your normal Cirque du Soleil show is fair perhaps but the show definitely still deliver in this aspect as well.  There is so much going on at one time it is sometimes hard to keep up with it all and you go into overload mode but in a good way.. . The Beatles have had such an impact on many peoples lives in one way, shape or form and for me their music resonates big time in me and is often playing loudly in my head.  I enjoyed the entire show but the several of the scenes such as Hey Jude and Lucy in the Sky really stood out above some of the rest.  The show will take you through the entire gambit of emotions as you embark on the roller coaster ride that is this show.  You will feel the happiness and joy that many songs convey one second while being brought back down into a more somber, melodic and melancholy feel the next.  The show moves at a breakneck pace but never fails to keep you thinking and watching at every turn.  . . The special effects and props used were done to absolute perfection and really have to be seen firsthand to be believed.  They did an excellent job of weaving in world events and other periods of Beatlemania into the story which really gave the show a complete feel.  The Beatles are one of those bands who like them or not whose music will be around forever and will continue to resonate with people in different ways.  They truly were a once in a lifetime band that will love on forever and this show is a perfect homage to them.  If you are in Vegas and looking for a show this would definitely top my list.  Beatles and non Beatles fans alike will fall in LOVE with this show (pun intended).
This is unquestionably the best thing in modern Vegas.  This is partly because it's one of the few (perhaps the only) culturally significant things you can experience at Vegas-style scale and production in the city; most of Vegas is a giant celebration of its empty self and if you are a person with any sort of appreciation for humanities, and have a bit of intelligence and self-awareness you probably have some internal dilemmas about the city that can only be quelled by drinking profusely or finding your own personal state of abandon.  This show should temporarily put your consternation on hold because it such a tasteful and beautifully considered treatment of the band and their music.. . Being a cynical child of the 90's I went into this experience prepared to be very disappointed but I was immediately taken from the moment the show began by the SOUND.  I'm sure it's covered in other reviews but the first thing you've got to know is that the music was produced by Sir George Martin himself - if you don't know who that is that's fine...... but you should probably be, I don't know, learning more about the world around you in general then. ;)  Instead of some terrible sholcky four-to-the-floor remix of their tunes you get to hear really interesting alternate takes on many of their songs with perhaps the most spectacular modern sound system my ears have had the privilege to be exposed to.  It really is quite stunning, especially when you consider all of this music was originally recorded in an era when we were just getting things like stereo sound and multi-track production.. . Personally I'm not a huge fan of Cirque (kind of bores me to be honest) but the production of this show is quite a bit different.  It feels more akin to a musical theater production or if there was theater production of a music videos.  Of course it probably doesn't hurt that the soundtrack is some of the most well-known popular music of the 20th Century but I find the show highly engaging from start to finish.  The most famous "prop" of the show couldn't happen during a better song or moment in the performance and you'll know it when it happens.  . . Even the lobby, concessions and merchandising for Love is really well-considered and perfectly in theme with the band and their legacy. . Plan ahead and get seats up front because all the good seats are always gone weeks in advance.  It's not cheap but it's worth every penny.
Second time seeing the show and I loved it even more than the first! The first time it felt like since there was so much going on, you couldn't really focus on certain things accurately, but this second time I saw everyhing. Including all the little details I missed the first time. Any seat has a good view. If you can't find cheaper tix on travelzoo, try the cirque website.
Mesmerizing! This is an amazing visual performance you won't forget. It was at times dream-like, acrobatic, funny, dramatic. It's an added bonus if you like the Beatles. I was fully entertained and was so thankful to be able to experience this. Go!
Disclaimer ***I am a Beatles fan but not a "fanatic"*** ok that out of the way, Holy hell!!! As soon as the curtains drop you get hit with sensory overload I wanted to cry because my brain couldn't process the images my eyes were capturing at the speed that they were coming in. Music is everything mix it with a cirque performance with top notch performers and a top notch theatre staff from the box office to the bar and the ushers 5 stars all around. Every one needs to see this show, unless you just hate puppies, Apple pie, and the baby Jesus if you hate any of those things then you'll probably hate the show and should just not even bother.

It took me days to write, maybe just a few. It's based on music, by the Beatles. And I need a compliment, so I want you to give me a "Good Writer". I'm a yelp writer. . It's visual representation of a 60's rock band. And if you don't pay attention you won't understand. They all work for Cirque du Soleil,. It's a steady job, but they want to say "They're a yelp writer". I'm a yelp writer. . I'm a yelp writer. . It's 27 acts, give or take a few. Make advance reservations more than a week or two.

Best show we've seen!. Its amazing watching everything happen at once. The music, performers, and video. If you are looking for a show, and don't know what to see...this is a Must!
I'm 66 and handicapped.  I attended with my rented "power scooter" and sat in a seat designed for mobility impaired!  My circumstances could not have been handled with more sensitivity!  AND having been of the generation of the British Invasion and having seen The Beatles introduction on the Ed Sullivan Show then eventually seeing . The Beatles live concert in '65 all I can say is Cirque NAILED IT!!!! I felt whisked back in time to the point of tears!  MIRAGE....you NAILED IT with your absolute could not be better accomadations!
It was a huge let down, and maybe it's because I'm not a fan of the Beatles nor do I know anything about them.... . The stage is so dark and the music is so monotone that it was like a lullaby.  Needless to say, I slepthalf of the time.. Also, the acrobatics were so mediocre compared to KA that it felt like watching those circus solelis that travel around the US that are just sub-par.. . I recommend KA to everyone and save $$$ on watching this show.
It was great until a performer fell to the stage, and we weren't sure if he was dead or alive. Thankfully, we found out the next day he was okay. . . I'm not sure I'll ever go to a Cirque show after that experience. What a shame.
If I could give this 100 stars I would!!!! Absolutely amazing acrobatics and the music was phenomenal and had great quality!! I did not want this breath taking show to end!! All the staff there were so nice and the show was simply amazing! The actors and actresses genuinely looked like they were having fun as well which made it so much better! Love The Beatles and love this show!!!
I have been wanting to see this forever. So we are here for New Years Eve and decided to finally buy tix. My man and I both found it to be too many slow songs and too much about a war torn era. There was so much pain in their writing. Instead of Love, I would call it War. I would definitely not recommend it even there are so many great acrobatic scenes. We literally came out of there depressed and spent $400 for the privilege of being depressed! Save your money and do something upbeat that makes you happy!
So before the end of year, I have to write about the coolest thing I did this year. And that was seeing The Beatles LOVE in Las Vegas. . . I had only seen one Cirque show before, which was Totem. Totem is a traveling show, which had already amazed me with its quality of performance. I was expecting around the same for this show, but it completely blew my expectations out of the water.. . We chose The Beatles LOVE because it was in a reasonable price range and seemed the most entertaining. I had grown up listening to The Beatles (I grew up in Berkeley). My boyfriend wasn't as excited about it since he didn't but he enjoyed it a lot anyways.. . Everything from the beginning to the end was just amazing. Even the opening scene had captured me. It was mind-blowingly beautiful. Everything about it was just pure art... The music, the dancing, the aerial tricks, the theater, the special effects. The funny thing is, when you hear the lyrics to some Beatles songs now such as "I want to be in an octopus's garden in the shade", you think in your head "what were they thinking??...". And from watching this show, you can almost understand what was going through their head as they were writing these songs.. . I love the stylistic art in this show. It really captured the whole peace, love, and psychedelic movement of the Beatles. It has something for everyone. It is wholly entertaining on the outer surface, and yet there seems to be some deep meaning behind it. If you pay attention to the reoccurring themes and symbolism, there is a whole different story playing out aside from all the tricks and stunts that are going on.. . My only regret is that we didn't get better seats. We were in section 304, and the best seats in the house are the 200s, not the 100s. There is so much stuff going on and they utilize the entire stage. The sound is outstanding since the speakers are built into the seats. I was really blown away by how much the special effects make a difference. The visuals and the sound were just amazing in creating the perfect psychedelic experience.. . I would highly recommend this show to anyone, Beatles fan or not.
