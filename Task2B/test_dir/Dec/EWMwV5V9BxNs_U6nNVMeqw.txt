Very cool atmosphere, drink menu, and unique food menu. I had the FEZ salad which was excellent (really one of the best salads I've ever had) and the lamb sliders which were also very good. Highly recommend it to anyone visiting Phoenix.
I absolutely love this place!  Their food is delicious and their happy hour is always a lot of fun!
My friend and I are traveling from Minnesota and had a recommendation to come eat here. She ordered the FEZ burger and was absolutely in love. The spicy harrisa fries on the side were crisp on the outside and fluffy inside with a great flavor.  And the burger-Amazing. A toasted ciabatta bun with a half pound Angus beef burger with deliciousness.  Spicy honey molasses barbecue, cinnamon pears, feta, lemon garlic aolie, crispy onions, and cilantro. So yummy. . . I ordered the arroz con pollo, Extra spicy.  I was blown away with this dish. Saffron rice, veggies, tender and succulent chicken chunks, with a half avocado on the side. (totally worth it!)  . . Service was friendly and prompt.  Lyndsey was wonderful. They also have drink specials that look amazing.  If you're in Phoenix and looking for lunch, go here. You'll be happy you did.
Lyndsey is the BEST! Ask for her asap! The place is very modern and very welcoming to the gay community ;) the service is great the people are very nice and the drinks are amazing! Definite place to come and have dinner lunch or breakfast!
I'm in love. . . Love. Love. Love. . . Bruscetta Bleu cheese goat cheese pistachio love. . . Yay. . . Oh,  I may have had a $4 mimosa or two... or three. . . Did I mention that I was in love with this place???
The FEZ Burger is out of this world good.  Awesome showcase of flavors, very fun modern burger
Blue cheese balsamic burger is delicious. The rosemary garlic fries are amazing. Great atmosphere and drink specials.
We were undecided on where to go for lunch so we flipped a coin and FEZ was the winner. We were not disappointed - the food, ambience and service was great! The happy hour was still on so we got $4 drinks. Drinks weren't special but the food was really good. Recommend trying the lamb sliders and the two kinds of hummus. I'm not really a dessert person (so granted I haven't eaten too many) but the tutti frutti was the best dessert I've eaten in all of 2014!
After spending 3 hours at Last Chance, my dad and I definitely needed some sustenance. FEZ was fantastic! We both loved the Gyro Pita, which has now become our favorite gyro over the one we had in Washington DC after a long, cold, hungry day (so that's definitely saying something). The place had a cool vibe and was pretty busy at 3 on a Thursday afternoon if that tells you anything. This is another Pheonix must, that's for sure!
The veggie bean burger here is delicious! The spicy  fries are pretty yummy as well. The only drawback is that this place does get pricey at times. I have easily spent 14 dollars on a salad here before. Though, the food is that good that I keep coming back.
WOW this place is AMAZING! I ordered the FEZ burger and it was very good. The sweet potato fries w/ parmesan garlic was yum, although a bit too salty for me. I thought all the salt was parmesan, so I kept putting all the "parmesan" on top of every fry I had until I was almost finished with it..yeah don't ask how that happened. I don't know either.. . The burger was good, I really liked the green sauce they had in it. What amazed me was what my boyfriend got. He got the special they had, lamb something with vegetables and mashed potatoes. I didn't like lamb until the night I had FEZ. It was SO delicious! I wanted to eat that instead but someone got mad that I kept digging in..... . FEZ also has a great dessert selection. I saw they had mascarpone cheesecake and just had to get one. Ever since I got one in San Francisco, I've been trying to find a place that had mascarpone cheesecake here in AZ. If any of you read this and knows of a another place, let me know!! But the cheesecake...mmmm...it was seriously heaven in my mouth. I love how thick the crust was! . . Service was good as well. I love the ambiance of this place, perfect for date night. I can't believe I waited so long to try this place.
Great burger! A tad too pricey for lunch. I like the vibe of this place. It would be great for happy hour or brunch, both of which they offer (I think). Service was slow but we were a table of 8 or 9.
Amazing experience, atmosphere, food. Super attentive waitress, awesome specials and fresh food!!! New found Favorite!
Excellent burgers, very friendly staff and good service. Great atmosphere as well.
