Slots were fairly loose (walked away +$60) for me when I played while on a layover. The Southwest terminal needs some SERIOUS updating. Only 3 sets of bathrooms and 15 outlets (yes I counted as I was bored without being able to charge up my devices) in the entire terminal. Food selection was decent however and reasonably priced for an airport.
For an airport this busy, during the holidays, service was great! Well-managed, well-manned. And clean! Glad I can use this airport often!
Quick and painless security checkout, plenty of eating options, a plentiful Duty Free Store, and helpful staff. I lost my boarding pass as my plane was boarding, but the cashier at the Starbucks suggested I use the courtesy phone. The clerk on the phone was very helpful, and informed me that the attendant at the boarding counter could print a new pass for me. Sure enough, I was on the plane within minutes!
Simple and fast, I can't say much more. You don't get all your fancy shops, but it has Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. Though I think they should have those moving floors on both sides because you do have to walk quite a bit to go to your gate for SW. . . I wished their wifi worked better and wish they had filtered water. . . Security is nice and quick, you do have to take off your shoes if you have metal, which is a pain in the ass.
The TSA agents here are so rude and don't even give you an opportunity to put your items in the bin before they basically tell you to hurry up and push them through. The only reason I gave an extra star is because southwest has always been wonderful through any airport I have traveled through with them, which is many.
My experience flying in was different than flying out.... . Flying in:. Flight delay got us there late. We were surprised to see the rows of slot machines all over the airport. The restroom was clean. The walk to baggage claim was a bit long. When we got to baggage claim, we had to wait for an hour for our luggage due to a malfunction on the carousel. After we got our bags, we headed out to find a taxi. I did not expect to find over 100 people in line for a taxi, but the staff kept the line moving well. After 20 minutes we got a taxi to our hotel (Luxor, about $24 bucks trip).. . Flying out:. We found out we could take a bus to the airport (from in front of Tropicana hotel). We flew Southwest, so we stopped at the Terminal 1 stop. I was surprised by how large the check-in area was. It took us a little less than 10 minutes to walk from the bus stop to the Southwest airlines check-in. There was no one in line, so checking our bags was very quick. I had my boarding pass on my phone and the scanners at check in were having a hard time reading it. One of the Southwest airline reps came over to help me scan it and after about 20 attempts it went through. I would say that this experience was the fastest bag check I've encountered. During security, we got routed through the pre-screen line, so security was a breeze. Once we got into the terminal, I was surprised to see how many people were there. It was difficult finding seating, so we sat in a couple empty chairs in a nearby area. There were tons of restaurants and fast food places and variouslittle shops. Every space was taken up by a shop, restaurant, slot machines, or a charging station. This has to be the most dog friendly airport because I saw almost 10 dogs being led on leashes inside the terminal. There were no comfy chairs...at all, so we were terribly uncomfortable. A lot of people were sitting on the floor, and some were even laying on the floor (which looked disgustingly dirty). There were only a couple of power outlets in the airport and they were all full with people sitting on the floor next to them to use them. I found it odd that they didn't place any outlets near the seating areas. We got moved at the last minute with a gate change, but the staff seemed efficient and kept us updated every step of the way. During our waiting, we did play some slots - there weren't really any good ones and they weren't very loose, but it was fun to sit and play while we waited.
Highlight(s) - Getting off the plane from LA to a not-so-crowded airport, grabbing a quick beer, shiny bright lights and those 'loose' slots janglin' 'n ranglin'.. while heading back home from Vegas we were part of an 'express' security check point that was properly coordinated, well structured and moved us through at a fairly fast pace. Sweet.. . Lowlight(s) - Smell't like Vegas, typical airport food n' drinks that cost an arm and a leg and restaurants / gift shops seemed to close around 10ish.. you know, around the time I showed up? I thought we were in Vegas?!. . I'll admit maneuvering through this airport was a breeze and locating where I needed to be was non-stressful. It's definitely not a huge airport by any means, but there's enough room to entertain and take care of the significant amount of travelers that move in and out of this place daily.. . See ya soon, McCarran.
All the restaurants close very early which is odd. I flew during Thanksgiving weekend and not one place was open at 10pm while the whole airport was bustling. Made no sense. Also, there were barely any outlets and the charging stations are always full and not worth the wait line.
Not my fave airport, the AA terminal is remote so you have to take a train, which adds time. Security is a cluster, with the Pre-check line poorly signed. No admiral's club, but they do have a nice Amex lounge if you have a Platinum card. Also, slot machines everywhere, so you can try to make your fortune on the way home!
Why wait until you hit the strip to start to gamble, might as well try your luck as soon as you get hop off the plane..right? Has to be one of the cooler airports just cause a few minutes outside is the famous strip and you can gamble (not a gambler but still a cool feature). Seems to be a pretty good size airport (didn't really take the time to walk through it all) with some decent food choices. If you have a rental car you will need to hop on a 5 minute shuttle ride to the compound that houses all of the agencies. The shuttles are constantly running but no worries the weather is amazing so you got nothing to complain about while you wait and just take it all in. I have been to this airport a few times and never have had an issue with security lines, always seem to go by really quick regardless of the time flying out, so no need to be there way ahead of time, unless you plan on trying your luck with a machine or two at the gate.
Worst airline, worst customer service. Pretty sure this airline will not be around in the future due to its bad business practices.
I must say this is one of my favorite airport! I've been told that I feel this way because I'm entering in the newest terminal but who cares?. . It's always clean and brand new. This airport always smells like money to me. I enjoy seeing the different food eateries and shops. If there's anything you might need, you will probably find it in the Las Vegas Airport. I'm already excited that they're building a MAC counter in the middle of the terminal. Just in case you forget your Ruby Woo red lipstick...
Seems like any other airport (at least Terminal 3/E gates), except there are slot machines everywhere and they play country music (my ears cry in agony).. . Waiting for our flight to Mexico City.  I have to pretend I speak Spanish so I can be seated in an emergency row (more leg room!!)
This is a nice and efficient airport. Baggage claim is a bit far away otherwise not much to complain about. Allegiant is terrible but cheap of course. Dont drink you last nite in town for a better flight.
It's a bit flashy and a lot trashy, and I'm totally fine with that.. . Leave it to Vegas to prioritize slot machines, glitzy welcome signs, and tourism hoards over the practical needs of an airport, like clearly-marked signs, good food options, and lots of charging stations.. . McCarran does have some good stuff going for it too: friendly people everywhere, a quick check-in and security, and free wifi.
Busy. Crowded. Populated. Slot machines. Alcohol. Cigarette lounges.... Need I say more?!? It's Las Vegas and you will find tons of people, and lots of stuff stuff happening. This airport isn't your average airport!  You'll see drunk ratchet hung over people randomly lighting cigarettes in areas they aren't supposed to, sports teams coming through, young kids running around, bachelorette and bachelor entourages etc. One thing I can guarantee is that you will not be bored watching the mass amounts of people here.  Also be prepared to have to wait in line somewhere at some point while you are in this airport whether it be the bathroom or for food.  It's something you can't avoid.
I like this airport for my layovers than other airports as you can preoccupy yourself with the slot machine or the bars.  It is Vegas.  I wonder though if anyone actually wins.  Each terminal is pretty small compared to other airports' terminals, which makes it easy to walk around without getting too tired or without being late for your connection flight.  They have a few charging stations and of course Ethel M chocolates!. . The airport appears old.  Since it's also smaller, there are not a lot of seats and the seats are uncomfortable, so it sucks when you fly in or out of here.  It can get crowded and claustrophobic quick, so it's almost better to go to the bars/restaurants.  I always see people sitting on the ground bc there are not enough seats.  As mentioned by others, the taxi line can be long.  I think that's a given anywhere.  I suggest calling a shuttle company.  Shared shuttles are cheaper too and you can get a discount if you schedule a roundtrip vs one way.
This is a great airport. I'm not sure why people don't like it but, boo hoo to them. . . Its large but not too large. They have many different options for food. . . They have planes here, I'm not really sure what else to say. It's clean. I don't have any complaints.
Nothing good to say about this airport. Terrible selection of seemingly always understaffed restaurants and bars (i.e. Home Team Sports in terminal b, what a joke), total lack of charging areas so people are scattered on the floor along hallways plugged into outlets next to restrooms, ridiculously inconvenient access between terminals c and b if you have a transfer, the list goes on. Sadly, if you are here, it's probably because you need to fly on a plane and you have no choice. So grab a shot with your beer and enjoy a cold prepackaged sandwich out of a cooler. Cheers.
PROS:. . 1. Easy to find.. 2. Provides shuttle bus and trams . 3. Gamble on some slot machines while you wait!. 4. Restaurants, Bars, and Shops for you to eat/shop while you wait!. . . CONS:. . 1. Smaller airport than what I'm used to.. 2. Expensive food/drink prices.. 3. Not enough chairs to accommodate all travelers at each gate. 4. A bit unorganized because they are constantly switching flights to different gates at last minute notice. . 5. No outlets on the chairs to charge your cellphones/electronics.. 6. Airport could use an update on carpet and lighting. Looks a bit old and run down.
I have to say, to start, that I am biased. I love small airports, and only small airports. Anything more than 10 gates and I'm irritated and overwhelmed. So McCarran is absolutely not my cup of tea. It's massive--and I've only had the (dis)pleasure of experiencing 1 of the terminals. It takes a long time to get your bags. It's a long walk to get anywhere. Plus there are slot machines everywhere which annoy me to no end. . . One personal experience led this review to be bad rather than just mediocre. I was on a layover and trying to catch a couple minutes of my illustrious university's football game. I stopped by a small bar and asked if they could switch the channel, mostly because it was basically empty and nobody was watching the televisions at all. The bartender acted all put upon that I--a customer--wanted a game that I wanted to watch on the tv! Imagine that! He was all snippy and acted like I was being super demanding about it. To add insult to injury, one of his coworkers made a derogatory comment about my school which, if you know me, is just about the worst thing you can do to me. So maybe it's small or unfair of me, but that experience made me decide not to give this airport the benefit of the doubt. If that bartender hadn't been a turd, I would've given a higher rating. Go ahead and hate me if you want.. . Also, tip from the big sis who lives here: A taxi to the strip should be about $15 and should not involve a freeway. If it does, you're being "long-hauled" and you need to call the taxi commission (the number will be inside the cab) and it's a massive fine for your cheating cab driver. So watch out.
Everything was fine and quick except TSA. And good God, could they be more annoying? We had the great pleasure of dealing with one guy who obviously thought he was saving the world. He went on and on. Shouting stuff non-stop...and I mean NON STOP. He never shut up. It also took forever to get through. Other than that....greeeeeaaattt airport.../sarcasm
Great airport if you take away the slot machines or provide headphones for the gamblers. Free Wifi, clean bathrooms, and transportation to terminals is plenty. Good restaurants as well.
I guess it's been a while since I bellied up to a slot machine, they don't take coins anymore.  Was going to get rid of my lose change!
Five stars! Hell yeah! Easy in and out of.  I can gamble while I wait, whats not to love?  Or I can shop or eat or drink.  Gluttony starts at the Vegas airport and I like it!
If you want to feel lost and confused, I think you'll have fun in the  Las Vegas airport. There aren't many signs that indicate where pick up areas are. You think you find it...then you're told you need to take a shuttle bus for 15 mins to get the the other side. Yes. Very disorganized. But, that's the only disfunction. It's a relatively big airport. . . There are slots to welcome you to this fun city or to occupy you as you wait to board. They are located right across from the gates. . . There are also plenty of resturants, quick eateries and coffee joints. Starbucks galore.. . The bathrooms are also very clean.. . And there are trams located in the airport that shoot you to your terminal/gate.. . Enjoy :)
I have flown to this airport quite a bit because of many Vegas excursions. Why it has never occurred to me to review airports is beyond me. Well at least I have come to my senses now. Anywho what can I say I like this airport. It has slot machines in it which is completely badass. You get one last shot at some bug buck before you go and it does help pass the time while waiting for flights. Ok I am going to break this down now. . . Security:. We all have to take our shoes off and go through security. That can either be a very painful experience or it can be easy. Even though it is unpredictable I can say for all the times I have come here it has been easy. they have a system and they know how to move people through security quickly. the agents there really do not want to waste any time. They just wanna get people through and on their way. The only delays really come from people who are not prepared. . . Restaurants and shops:. This airport has plenty of restaurants and shops. They have the small little generic gift shops and they also have really nice high end type stores where you can get clothes, shoes and handbags. They have a good mix of fast food type places and sit down type places. Be aware that they charge airport prices though so get ready to pay more. . . Navigation:. This airport is really easy to navigate through. They have plenty of signs pointing you in the right direction. It is hard to get lost here. they have plenty of elevators, moving walkways, and escalators to help you get where you are going faster as well. Also getting out is easy. They have one area for people picking you up, another for taxis, and another for shuttles. It is very easy to get in and out. . . Overall this is a great airport. It has plenty of things to do and they keep ya moving.
OK as far as airports go. If you have trusted traveler, you can get through the security line much faster. Otherwise you will be waiting a long time. Yes you can gamble in the airport but I'm not sure it's a great idea either on the way in or the way out.
This is probably the best airport for people watching. Where else do you have both slot machines, indoor smoking rooms and liquor stores?! The people headed to Vegas are all bright eyed and excited, while those leaving Vegas are seemingly always on the opposite side of the spectrum. Never will you see such a contrast in faces and attitudes than you will here. . . As for the actual airport, I find it in need of a few upgrades. It always smells of old cigarettes and tragedy. The look and feel is very dated. Seems to always be some type of renovation happening but not much seems to get done. In the old part of the airport the bathrooms seem to always have the porta-potty smell. If it wasn't for the amazing people watching, I'm sure my review would be worse...
Food here isn't great as far as options go. Rarely ever win at the machines either so I'd prob not play them too often.
