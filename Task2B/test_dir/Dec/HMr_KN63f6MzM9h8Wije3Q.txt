One of my favorite places in the whole wide world is New York.  If I ever win the lottery that's where m moving too....  Maybe I should start playing???  I digress.  One of the best parts of Las Vegas (besides the booze) are the themed hotels.  I love the theme hotels, the really goods ones transport you somewhere else.  Yes, the "luxury" hotels are nice, but i much prefer to be in Faux-Paris, Faux-Venice or Faux-New York any day.. . ::::::::::HOSPITALITY::::::::::. . As is expected in Vegas, service is great.  We had an issue with the TV in our room and they were quick to replace it.  And quick to replace the replacement that died too lol.  The service technician was really funny so it wasn't all bad.. . ::::::::::ROOMS::::::::::. . We had a basic room and it was decent.  They have upgraded rooms available as well.. . ::::::::::EXTRAS::::::::::. . The roller coaster and arcade is great if you have family in tow.  Also, strolling along the mock city is pretty cool.  Once, a date and myself came in for a drink.  We had one drink (I think) and we were feeling pretty nice.  We went down to the machines and won a couple hundred dollars....SCORE.  I met a nice man here a few years ago... well I'm not sure if he was nice, but he kept buying drinks... and in my book that makes you nice.. . This hotel is good for being on the strip on a budget and with family.
Thin walls.. terrible view from the dirty window, . rooms FAR away from the elevator,. no refrigerator in the room, . loud vacuum from the maids, . Took forever for the toothpaste to arrive.. un friendly staff when you check in, I'm the guest remember?. . free wifi? its really NOT free if you're charging your guest $22.00  a night for a "resort fee". WHAT A SCAM!!!
This hotel was super cheap to stay at during the off season. Came here with my girlfriend in November and it was $45 a night !!! Great atmosphere within the hotel and I loved the interior design. The main floor is a casino but if you go up to the second level, there is an arcade. That is also where the entrance to the roller coaster is located. They had some great games at the Arcade too. You can also find Hersey's Chocolate World attached to the hotel. I think this is a new attraction since I don't recall seeing it in the past before.. . We booked the most basic room you could find and it was very welcoming. Had all the amenities we would expect, AC, Cable, Free Wi-Fi, King Size clean bed, Sofa and great window view of the roller coaster.. . My only gripe with this hotel as with any other place in Vegas is that the food was very expensive. They did have a Pizza place that was super cheap to eat at. All the other places charged on average $15-25 per person. That's what you would expect to pay if you went anywhere on the strip. I won't knock the hotel down because of this though. . . The hotel had a very family friendly atmosphere and I would definitely stay here again.
Love this hotel check-in is at three the roller coaster is cool and the atmosphere is really nice ! It is one of the older hotels but is cute  ! The shoping and food is hella good !
Stayed here for 3 nights last week and I have no complaints. Short distance between parking lot and your actual room, that's always a plus. I love how big Vegas hotels are, but sometimes after a long day of walking on the Strip you don't really want to walk another 30 min from your car to your room. . . Standard rooms are a little on the small side but that's not a problem for me. Why do you need all that floor space anyway? (Cough cough, Venetian) Front desk was very nice and polite; she waved our first night's resort fee because we got there super late at night. . . The only thing I dislike is their location. The hotel is a bit more South than the hotels I usually stay at, and that means further distance from hotels such as Bellagio and Caesar's Palace. For a more centralized location on the Strip, you're better off staying at Paris or Planet Hollywood.. . As far as dining options, NYNY has everything from quick bites like Nathan's hot dogs to an upscale restaurant like Gallagher's Steakhouse. We had a $35 dining credit and used it at their Irish pub, Nine Fine Irishmen. Pretty much ate for (almost) free. Overall, can't beat this hotel for the value. I had a free night from myVegas, got the other two nights from an Expedia deal, so I stayed for three nights for under $200, that's including resort fee. I'm definitely coming back!
Rude craps dealers talking all kinds of mess to you and ruining your rolling of the dice making you crap for nothing ...  This one again gentleman who I will keep nameless was working there yesterday morning and had the worst attitude in the world.. He gave me a bunch of crap for rolling short like I can actually control where the dice go!!!  I throw the same way every time if they land a certain way don't give me a bunch of lip and ruin my roll please thanks...
Most likely won't stay here again because of the experience.. Even though the price is great, the trouble wasn't worth it.. . I discovered bed bugs on my bed, so I slept with my clothes on.. Too tired to complain that day since I've been walking everywhere.. On top of that, the front desk accidentally charged me twice for my room... I caught the first one when I was checking out. They refunded me for the first one, then I realized they charged me again once I got back to my hometown.. I had to email billing dispute and wait for another week for a reply & a refund.. Too much problem & the bed was filthy. Gross. Make sure to check your bed, cause I always do.. . Won't be coming back.
For the amount of you pay, the locations a steal. We checked in twice over the course of a week and both times our rooms were upgraded (once to a strip view and once to a deluxe) upon check in and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.. We stayed in the Chrysler tower for the majority of our stay. If you're traveling with a lot of bags/kids/things that need to be lugged or pushed, enlist the help of the bell desk as it can be a maze to get to your room. We stayed on the 21st floor and I swear a vent from some burger place shot right up into the hallway. The room didn't have a fridge or microwave, and the bathroom looked like it could use some upgrading, but the beds were so plush and comfortable.. ....I'm also pretty convinced the room we were staying in was haunted. The bathroom light turned on and off and so did the TV. Also we would come back to a completely dark room at night when we distinctly remember leaving a light on........ Other than the ghosts its a pretty decent place to stay. Casino doesn't get too crowded and there's Hersey's World!
I stayed here with my girlfriend because her daughter got room for her birthday.  This hotel is pretty old and need renovation in a few months. it was a clean room and the beds were comfortable.  They do not offer shuttle to and from hotel.
