MGM is a classic vegasl hotel that you always see and hear about.  unfortuantely i didn't LOVE our experience.  i thought the rooms were aiite and the walls were INCREDIBLY thin.  You could hear everything that was going on in the hallway, including 2 love birds in the next room.  eeek.. . the hotel floor itself is fine, there were lots of restaurants, clubs, and bars to visit.  I liked the location of MGM but probably wouldn't return to stay at this hotel.. . i do want to note though, that every staff/service person we met was incredibly friendly.  we had a great experience there, but just didn't find it as comfortable or as sound proof as venetian or encore.
Nice presentation, but the details are made of ick. . . 1) Minor, questionable stains on my sheets and comforter. . 2) No plunger for bathtub. If you want a bath, you are SOL. Showers only here. . 3) Despite having no plunger, bathtub doesn't drain. Called at 6:30. Was told earliest would be 8.  It is 8:30 and plumber still has not arrived. I am here for a conference and am missing the first class because I can't take a shower. . 4) No coffee maker in room. Even cheap, sleazy hotels have coffee in the room. Does MGM need money that badly? . 5) Fridge in room is only for selling things. You cannot store your own things or you will be fined. . 6) TV worked occasionally. Frequently it just shuts itself off.. . . All in all, the room is spacious enough and check in went quickly, but the quality inside is really lacking. I expected more from a strip hotel. Very disappointed.
This is the worst hotel I've stayed at in Las Vegas in over ten years of visited here, and this includes the one time I had to stay at the Tropicana.  Our room was tiny and the one chair and bed were both very uncomfortable.  Our shower, which appeared to be the one nice thing, leaked terribly and soaked the entire floor in the open bathroom area.  We addressed this three times, all three times they said they would take care of it as well as give extra towels because all of ours were soaked from trying to dry up the floor, and not once was anything done.  The only time someone seemed to actually care was at the check-out so it was a bit late.  I liked gambling at the tables here and like Craftsteak and Joel Roubuchon and have enjoyed several fights here, but I will never step foot in this dump again.
The Bocelli concert. One we expected to take place and blow my wife and I away, since we saw him last 9 years ago. It is clear a lot has changed. Bocelli is out of touch with his public.  None of the songs that made him famous we expected to hear and the public craved for were sang.. . We almost fell as sleep. He forgets people come to see him not other personalities. Not sure who is managing his events but, they are doing a disservice to such a telented individual.. . It is truly a shame and not worth $300 dollars a ticket to be disappointed like this.. . This is over. Bocelli is now a memory, nothing else.
Early check in was fast and smooth but we did not get the king bed room we booked and paid for. Instead, we were given a queen size with a view of the airport but not informed of this at check in, so disappointed from the start. When I called the front desk I was told the hotel was crowded and that was all that was available. Oh well!. . The room was decent but there was a sewer gas odor in the bathroom sink. Facing the airport in the Grand Tower is like having someone with a leaf blower outside your room. Forget about sleeping in or bring earplugs if you want to stay in bed past 6:00 AM. At $245.00 a night, we will spend our money elsewhere.. . We ate at Wolfgang Pucks and Emeril Lagassies venues. The service was very good at both and the entrees were good. . . I can't recommend this hotel if you are located facing the airport, there is no peace.
About two months ago, I booked two tickets to Andrea Bocelli concert at MGM Grand Arena. Since I thought it'd be convenient to stay at MGM, I also booked a room - king size, non smoking. The prices for two nights were $149 (Friday night), $179 for Saturday night. They charged me $166. When I got there, I was told the room wasn't available. If I wanted, I got "the option" to upgrade (which I'd have to pay for). I got slightly upset, although I never raised my voice. . . I asked why I'm being charged $166 for something I'm not getting and why I was forced to pay for something I don't want? The manager came over and immediately said "She's just doing her job!" No s**t Sherlock! I'm not upset at the receptionist, I'm upset at the situation. Not fair to be charging customer for something he/she's not getting. On top of that, they place a pending charge on your CC (for me, it was $500 pending charge). . . So they offered comp buffet and $50 off drinks. This is great for someone who eats at buffets and drinks, but I'm not a drinker and I don't eat at buffets, but when I said it to the manager, she said "well, that's your only option." In regards to rooms, they are spacious, clean. The TV was working occasionally, the bathrooms were nicely remodeled. I must say the concert was fabulous!. . When I was checking out, I don't know what I was expecting, but I got "how do you wish to pay for your bill" question. This kind of floored me. So the rooms were $328 total minus the $166 charge (this would be around $162 total)+ the upgrade fee. You are already placing $500 charge on my CC, I guess I'm expecting you to say what you are going to give back to me. . . Anyway, long story short, the 2 nights cost me total $502. They charge you for upgrade you didn't want, they also charge your for something called "remodeled room", "remodeled room tax" (these charges are for every day you are staying) on top of your regular resort fee. I'm assuming that is normal, but quite frankly....for $250/night - it is NOT worth it.
I stay at Mgm grand on Nov 30 - Dec 4 ,2014.Our room is Stay Well grand queen.We like Vitamin C infused shower and Air Purification in our room.Bed is very comfy.
Stunning! An adults dream world! Very well presented. The place is absolutely immaculate. Loved every second of it.
I finally got to stay here after using my MyVegas Slots points. I only had to pay $28 for the resort fee. Check-in was quick. The receptionist was nice and upgraded us to 2 beds for no extra charge. The lobby had strawberry and pineapple infused water. . We had the standard room with 2 queen beds. The bathroom was spacious with bright lights around the mirror. The automatic shades consisted of "sheer" as well as "black-out", which is a must if you want good quality sleep well into the afternoon after a long, fun, wild night. The TV remote was horrible. The signal lagged or something. . . The casino itself is huge. The elevators are fairly easy to find though. It's a pain when you have to walk deep into the casino from the lobby just to get to the elevator (like Mirage and Planet Hollywood). . The food court is not bad. You can find some cheap, quick food to eat and avoid the high end restaurants. They need to add a Jamba Juice though. . The pool is a bit of a walk to the back of the hotel, but it's nice. They have some regular pools as well as a lazy river. . Wifi is free IF you have a hotel room. They deactivate it soon after you check out. . I would definitely stay here again if the price is right. Though it is usually higher than what i want to pay. I guess it's worth it if you're going to see a fight or show here
The NFR transforms this place into a cowgirls dream. Country bands Cowboys ad great music
What a garbage operation. Rude customer service every step of the way, overpriced rooms and they are not even that nice. They also charged us much more than what the front desk girl promised for an upgrade fee, and it took nearly two months to get only a partial refund for their mistake. . . Never staying here again. Much better Vegas options, such as The Wynn, Encore, and Cosmopolitan.
The room was clean and looked great. All the food we ate was awesome. I would stay there again.
This is a great stay consider I paid $65 per night.  The room is very nice and clean. Housekeeping was friendly and brought complimentary toothbrush/paste upon request. The view from my room on the 28th floor was spectacular. The only drawback is the walk from garage to the hotel; it was very far.
One of my favorites hotels. I've fallen in love with M Life resorts/casinos because they have the blackjack switch game. Sports galore. Love the lobby area.  Self park is easy accessible. Only thing I noticed is valet service can get full and takes a wee bit more patience when waiting to get your car upon leaving.
Booked a Tower Suite for my fiance and I for a weekend away.  We did it the smart way and stayed Sunday-Wednesday.  These are the "off" days and it saved us a bunch of money in hotel costs.  . . We got early check-in which I always love.  Gives us time to settle in before heading out.  Our room was AWESOME.  King size bed with separate sitting area.  Last time I was in Vegas we stayed at Aria and there was an issue with outlets for charging out devices.  MGM had plenty of them!  This made me happy!  . . Our bathroom was my fav with a soaking/jetted tub for two.  Created a lot of relaxation time.  . . The mini bar had some great items and actually were reasonably priced.  I know that $6 for a beer seems a lot but that's just about the cost if your order downstairs.  We bought bottled water off the strip and would keep it cold in ice/water in the sink.  . . Parking was good.  We did valet a few times but it did take awhile to get our car during busy times.  The parking garage was pretty easy to get to as well.  . . We ate at some local restaurants and also took in the show, Ka.  My favorite was the spa.  I scheduled their special of the season a honey/milk massage.  It was amazing!  I like the spa area with Jacuzzi and sauna.  I wish I could have taken more advantage of it but we had a full schedule.  . . The only downside was that we could hear a lot of noise from outside at night.  This wasn't a huge issue as we would just turn up the TV or put music on to sleep at night.  . . I would recommend this hotel, especially the deals you can get during the off-schedule.
I was actually pretty pleased with MGM.  The room was clean and comfy.  Their hot water is amazing!!  Check in was quick and painless.  I was disappointed with one aspect though.  When I booked, there was suppose to be a free upgrade to either a stay well suite or the king suite.  When I asked about it I was told that neither suite was available.  I understand that the upgrade isn't guaranteed, but I have a hard time believing that neither suite was available.  The husband wasn't super crazy about the location (he prefers central strip) the location didn't bother me though.  I did find that the doors/walls are on the thin side.  I was woken up a couple of times by loud drunk people.  But it is Vegas and that is to be expected.  All in all I would stay here again.
3.5 STARS. . Stayed here over the weekend in a Grand Tower Suite.. . We had a king bed that was not as soft as I thought it should be. But the the pillows and blankets were really nice. . . Nice flat screen TV, glass desk, couch, coffee table and mirrored walls.. . It was lame that they only have a mini fridge filled with drinks you have to buy and no room for our personal drinks.. . Our view was pretty nice, but most of it was the roof of the parking structure below.. . My favorite thing about the room is probably the bathroom because it was very modern, clean, and bright. They had many towels of all sizes and was enough for at least four people. . . Although the hot water was always too hot or not hot enough. I had difficulty getting it to the right temperature. The shower curtains were two layers of cloth, which I would of preferred one layer to be plastic so that water does not get out.. . I would highly recommend parking your car with valet because it's a lot shorter walk. There was a point where Valet was full so we ha to park our car in the parking structure and it was sooooo far away and you have to walk through tunnels, elevators, and stairs just to get back.. . The check in/check out lobby also has pineapple fused water and watermelon fused water if you have trouble finding or buying expensive water!. . Overall, the hotel is nice and the workers here are friendly and efficient, but it wasn't outstanding or amazing.
HOTEL: DO NOT STAY IN THE WEST WING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES... EVEN IF ITS FREE. We got a comped room via "MyVegas" and they put us in a smoking room in the West Wing - as it was "all they had left." Immediately walking up to the West Wing I realized, Wow they put us in a DUMP because it was free! You can smell the cigarette and weed from downstairs and in the elevators... granted I don't really care about either smell but when its that obnoxious... yuck. Our room was 3-505... practically the LAST room at the end of the hallway. The hallway carpet was stained and sticky... the room literally smelled and looked like shit. I mean these rooms are supposedly "remodeled" but it really looks like they just gave it a makeover but the ugly shitty old rooms are still under there, I would've rather slept in my car! Also note that the other guests they put in this wing are pretty much the loud, rachet, ghetto degenerates. . . Thankfully - we had to go out so we just dropped off our stuff and left. However, when we came back, we went straight to the front desk to try to get an upgrade. THANK THE LORD FOR SOPHIA A. Sophia saved our trip.... I told her the situation, and she even laughed a bit when she found out we were in the West Wing. Apparently its KNOWN to the employees that its a shitty space. Anyways, she did some digging, talked to her manager, and was able to upgrade us to a room in the remodeled Grand Tower, AND on the 17th floor with amazing views of the strip!!! Sophia, you are a godsend! (and it was only her first month at the front desk!!). . CASINO: Special shout out to blackjack dealers Alex and Jojo, and pit manager Kris. You guys made our night!!! We came back from the club and decided to hit the slots and tables, so from 6:30am to lord knows when, we were entertained by this lovely group of dealers/managers. We gambled enough to get our 2nd night comped, which truly made this a fantastic trip! . . VALET: I can't count how many attendants are running around constantly LOL but for as many staff as they have, its about a 20-30 minutes wait for your car. We lost our ticket but thankfully they were able to find the car and were super nice about it. The attendants could be a little friendlier... but I get it, when you're making 5s and 10s all day, its hard to be nice to everyone. . . RESTAURANTS: The District offers a large selection of restaurants, and food court. We went to Avenue Cafe (breakfast,) PUB (lunch/dinner) and TAP (sports bar.) The food is ok, the prices are high as you should expect them to be for 1) its vegas and 2) its inside a hotel, but overall the convenience of not having to walk or cab anywhere to get some grub is worth it. You may find that all the restaurants look empty, don't let that deter you from trying it out! That happened to us at the PUB, we almost turned around because it was empty but it was the best burger and best fries ever!!! (http://www.yelp.com/biz/michael-mina-pub-1842-las-vegas?hrid=yZFbHgcC_BdGqbi8x6bHwg). . Thank you MGM, thank you MLife... thank you for those that are superb customer service professionals! I know not everyone is like that so when I do come across great service, I truly appreciate it.
I had an excellent experience staying here. Stayed in the penthouse which was a gorgeous room complete with a large living area, dining area, bar, one big bedroom (with a king bed), two bathrooms (one which had a GIANT bath, and last but not least, an incredible view. . . The staff was very welcoming and courteous. Casino is top notch and one of the bigger ones in Vegas, I particularly liked the Sportsbook. . . Great selection of restaurants as well.
We are greatly satisfied with our stay here. The hotel is simply stunning. It smells clean, the details are lovely, and if you book at the right times you can get an amazing rate. We paid $100 a night during the middle of the week! They held our luggage until check in time, and the process in doing so was easy and professional. We were checked in promptly, and the worker helping us said our rate was simply amazing. Though, my only complaint was that the room we booked online looked modern and upgraded. He informed us that the room they'd be giving us would not be. I'm assuming because of the low rate we paid. Therefore, he asked if we wanted to upgrade for $30 a night for their "Stay Well Suite." We opted to do so and it was the best choice ever. We then pushed a little for something complimentary. Why not try the luck? After informing him that it was my birthday, he gave us free tickets to the MGM Buffet. He told me Happy Birthday and suggested some places for us to go on the Strip. The entire check-in experience was wonderful and we were treated like valued customers. I couldn't have asked for more.. . On the way to our room, we were constantly surprised by just how gorgeous this hotel is. The casino leaves something to be desired, but it's a lot cleaner and less smoky than many of the ones we visited. It's on par with the Bellagio and Cesar's Palace, minus the beautiful sky scene. The Stay Well Suites have their own tower in the hotel, and a fountain in the middle that divides the sections. The fountain is breathtaking, as well as the elevator hallway. It's really something you just have to see for yourself. When we arrived to our room, we realized we had a semi-strip view. We didn't know we'd get a great view, so you canimagine the excitement there. The upgrade was completely worth it. The shower is infused with a Vitamin-C diffuser so that it streams through the water while you shower. There's a sound cube that plays sounds for you in case you have trouble sleeping. The bathroom had different lighting options for the mirror, which was a great touch. All the sheets and pillows are hypoallergenic, and extremely comfortable. The room felt clean and crisp, and smelled fantastic when we arrived.. . We ate at the MGM buffet, and it was a decent little spot to catch a quick bite. A bit pricey for those who pay to eat, though. The service was good, and afterwards, we headed to concierge to find out about our Cirque Du Soleil show in the hotel. We had questions about when the show started, and the staff working were amazing when it came to answering our questions and offering suggestions on where to eat and places to go. They treated us like extremely valued guests, and I was genuinely surprised at how kind all of the staff are. We saw Ka in the MGM Theater, and I highly suggest this show. We weren't staying on a peak night, so the theater was about half full and we moved a little closer to be nearer to the action. It was absolutely wonderful. I was worried from reviews that it wouldn't be as thrilling as higher-ticket shows such as "O", but it left both my girlfriend and I feeling really satisfied with our choice.. . The hotel is the largest on the strip, so sometimes getting from place to place can be quite a hike. We took the LV monorail system quite a lot, and it was a bit of a walk to get there from our Wing of the hotel. The pool area is also a fair bit away, so keep that in mind while booking. It is definitely worth the walk, however. The pool at the MGM was actually the reason we chose this hotel over several others. The lazy river is amazing and includes a waterfall area that we thought was just beautiful. Within the lazy river, there are areas that are quite fun, such as a wall of water that beats down on you like heavy rain. Details like this make this pool area top notch compared to a lot of other hotels on the strip. There are other pools you can visit, though some of them were closed during certain hours. They opened them up eventually, and you could escape to these low populated areas when the others got a little too busy. There are lifeguards on duty and located sporadically around the pool area, so if you have kids, they're likely to be safe and well looked after. Even during week days, the pool was booming with action. I assume during weekends and peak periods it would be extremely busy and crowded. However, it's simply too great of an amenity to miss out on. . . Checking out was also a breeze. We received the same wonderful service as we did arriving. The hotel once again held our baggage while we walked around the Strip for a few more hours. There was fruit infused water located in the lobby, as it was a high heat day. It was delicious and the kind of gesture we got used to staying here. The workers simply know how to treat their customers. It may have just been our experience, but I hope you all receive the kind of stay we did.
Before I start, +1 for the beauty / value of the suite and professionalism of the staff.. . But I'm actually pretty shocked at our experience at the hotel.  The hotel casino & lobby area was pretty and glitzed up for Christmas / Boxing.  But our experience was marred by a failure of the customer service apparatus at every level even for a Gold+ member from beginning to end.. . We came here as a family with 4 rooms during the slow time before Christmas.  So when we booked via my Gold status on the MLife site, I even called in to make sure they were nearby or connected.  When we arrived, the line for the Gold+ level members only had 1 person while the regular line was really long.  The request was lost (go figures) so our kind receptionist tried her best to find rooms closer together.  But after 30 minutes (and by that time the regular line already cleared out :-( ), she had to downgrade one of my rooms to make it work.  She even mentioned that she had to deal with many very irate people pissed that Hakkasan was closed but nobody let them know when they booked.  I'm not a clubber but who's running the MGM ship? That grueling check-in gave a bad omen on the stay already.... . So our rooms smelled like light smoke but we were so tired from check-in, we didn't want to go through that ordeal again.  Let me list what went sideways instead of writing it out.. 1) Our bathroom light was broken.  We called but it never got fixed. 2) Our Shower temperature handle was broken.  It either got super hot or cold.  Never got fixed. 3) On our second night, my wife wanted to have a bubble bath.  Black water came out of the tub spout.  I had a black-humor laugh at my wife's expense. . 4) Asked for housekeeping to spray the room to clean out the smoke smell.  Since they didn't do #1 or #2, just a guess they didn't do this as well.  They told me to call sooner if we smell smoke to catch smokers in the act in the hallway.  It felt like my old days playing Bad-Cop RA.  I don't want to be a snitch to get a smoke-free room!. . Also, Avoid the 4th floor.  You're at the roof level and its a little awkward greeting workmen through your window in the morning in your nighties.  Needless to say, we had the shades down the whole time after that.. . Needless to say, I'm giving low ratings not for the broken things in the room since I understand Vegas.  I'm giving it for the customer service promising service but never delivering.  If a MLife Tier member had to deal with this, I wonder how the regular peasantry feel...
We spent some time in here at bars, snacking, and for our Cirque show.  . . Redeeming our ticket vouchers was so easy & fast!  They have great signage to find your way through the casino too, so that's good.  Large, clean restrooms, and open areas to chill & figure out what you wanna do next.  . . We liked the relaxed feel of their bars, particularly Centrifuge, for one, & Whiskey Down, for two.  (Will review individually).. . Had no trouble finding the Ka Theater and entry & seating was quick.  The show itself though?  Meh, another review.
Was supposed to see a show here  - Beachers  Madhouse. It was cancelled. No one here will refund us.
I can't believe how dirty the room is... I stayed at the spa suite which was pretty pricey so I expected the quality of the stay to be good. The room is big and looks very nice. However, the next morning when I woke up, I have a several bug bites all over my body, same goes for my bf. And we are sure we didn't have those the night before. Not only that, the sink plumbing was backed up, and black water flakes and hair kept coming out (I've attached the pic). We told them about the situation when we were checking out, they told us to go to the security to file a report. After filing the report and them taking pics of our bug bites, they told us they will have the room inspected and call us. The whole process was very unpleasant, they treated us like we are just trying to blame them for something that's our fault... And of course, we never heard from the hotel afterwards...
Update: apparently during the hour we were told the hotel would not help us someone at their box office did our refund. No one knew who was in charge. This place is unorganized and have the rudest staff. Hopefully or refund shows up in the next 5 business days as promised. Let's see if we get the apology letters as requested. Never going here or MLife affiliated hotels again.
http://www.urbanspoon.com/m/comment/4776494?action=mcomments&id=1803184. . The above relates to the Tap. We booked from 12/27/14 - 12/31/14 for a friend's birthday on Dec. 30th. Bad choice!. . We chose the MGM Grand as we were planning to stay at the MGM for the PAC-12 tourney (U of WA grad & MBB fan) spring 2015. We won't book there now especially as strong, enthusiastic sports fans and wanted to view the Seattle Seahawks play St. Louis. . . Thanks a lot Tap for nothing, zip, zero.
I received a complimentary two nights Im one of there general rooms. The room was nice (average size.) The bathroom is descent too. I love that they have a roulette table that's smokeless (That's rare in vegas.) a little disappointed with some of the Customer service. I was at the table for 5 hours playing 100 bucks a hand (don't worry I was up $$$) and could not get in touch with a host or anything (didn't even have one on staff when I was there.) Not worth playing there. There're no perks for playing there. Did love everything else besides that
Me and my husband, stayed here for a week and it was a good time. To start of with, we stayed at the west wing king room and it was sufficient for 2. The lobby is beautiful with all the christmas decor, casino-almost full every time. Starbucks, food court and  restaurants are close enough from the rooms. . You can always get a parking spot as they got multi-level parking. And, have to give credit to the staff for the super friendly attitude, excellent housekeeping and room service.. . Surely recommend this place and we be back again !!
We stayed in the Grand Tower and it was fairly nice.  We had a great view of New York New York and Excalibur.  One thing I did not know is that rooms do not have a coffee maker, microwave, or refrigerator.  No coffee maker means that you are stuck buying over-priced coffee from Starbucks (but everything is expensive in Vegas).  The daily refrigerator fee is $25... so it's cheaper to buy food than to keep leftovers.  There is a large convenience store near the west entrance and this can save you A LOT of money on snacks and beer (beer cans are 2 for $3).  The room rate is reasonable compared to other hotels, although we did not know that there is an additional $30 "resort" fee plus tax.  However, I think every hotel has this additional fee per night.  I personally liked this area of the Strip more because it was closer to the airport and was much less dense with people.  MGM also has a monorail station.  I recommend getting a 3-day monorail pass and planning accordingly.. . The layout of the hotel is a bit annoying though.  We were there for a week and still had trouble finding our way around the casino.  It can be a SLOW walk to go through the casino from the elevators to the west entrance, and the bars and restaurants are at the opposite end.  I guess that's the point though. We did not go to gamble, and it would have been better to stay closer to the west entrance.  Comment about Vegas in general: Be prepared to walk a lot.
The room  I got was small, furniture seemed old and worn out. Security box was very small. The resort fee the hotel charges is about 32 $ per night which is a lot higher...It should be charged only if one needs to use the facilities like swimming pool, cardio room .... For the price they charge its not worth.... There were no discounts  for shows,food for those who stay in the hotel...
