The service was lackluster at best. I heard the hostess complaining to one of the servers about her shift, loudly. Our server never ONCE checked on us after he brought the food. It also took a very long time (over 30 minutes) to get the food. That seems like a long time to wait for lunch. I would expect 15 to 20 minutes, especially since it wasn't that busy. Also, while the food was tasty, it cost us 82 dollars after tip for: One can of beer, two beef hamburgers, and one BLT.   I know Vegas is expensive but the meal wasn't worth more than thirty five or forty bucks, tops - even in Vegas. . My advice:  find somewhere less expensive with better service. You'll be happier.
We received super excellent service. On a scale of 1-10, my girlfriend and I rank probably an 8.5 on the beer knowledge / tasting scale. We sat at the bar, and the bartender could sense our experience based on a couple basic questions he asked about the kind of beer we like.. . He was a super star. He provided 3-4 (free) tastings, recommended an excellent Saison, and even opened a British IPA, poured us some, the people beside us some, and himself some, free of charge.. . Very friendly upscale experience, and I highly recommend giving this place a try.
We had a good experience. Hubby had (very expensive) fish and chips. $29 for two pieces of fish and fries. I had Shepard's Pie ($22) which was delicious.. . Great waitstaff and clean restaurant. My only disappointment was the bill: $69 with tip. I have spent less for a 3 course dinner in Vegas and received a comparable, if not better, experience.
Great food!. We ordered the shepherd's pie, some cherry dessert, lobster roll.
I am sooooo bummed that I have to give this place four stars rather than five. The food was definitely worth five but the service was a three. We spent over two hours in their and we just ordered an app, two entrees, and dessert. We saw the waiter a total of maybe four times.. . The first time we went to Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill, it was right after it opened. The energy was much higher and the service was better. This place holds a lot of significance to me because this is where I got engaged to my husband. I don't want it to go down hill!
Pros:. 1. Ice cold Newcastle at the bar. 2. Scotch Egg was very tasty. 3. Fries were super salty and hot. 4. Friendly bartender with a heavy hand on the alcohol :). 5. Meat pie sampler was top notch per my gal. . . Cons:. 1. Dusty front of the restaurant (the black steel window frames) right next to diners eating at the "patio". 2. Had a rare burger but the meat had zero seasoning and the bun was meh...wilted lettuce leaf, bland experience. 3. Prices were through the roof (we spent the same for lunch here as we did for  dinner at Gordon Ramsay's Paris restaurant). 4. Seating was designed with high back chairs that were way too low for the table - felt like we were eating at the kid's table. 5. Manager type guys in suits that looked like they were in the Mafia - never smiled or spoke to the diners.
During our recent trip to Las Vegas, we thought we would try Gordon Ramsay's restaurant.   . . We had the French Onion Soup, Prime Rib, and Bangers and Mash.   Simple dishes that should be hard to mess up.   From cold soup to fatty prime rib and inefficient wait staff, the experience was horrible... and expensive.  . . I think perhaps Gordon should stop by and dine at this location - it does no justice to his name, and could benefit from one of his TV "makeovers"
If you are expecting good food across the board, this is not your restaurant.  I had a red wine that was barely okay and the burger was not seasoned well at all - A little salt and pepper made it better.  There was  too much garlic for my taste and it actually overpowered the rest of the meal.  Fries were like any other place you get fries.  However, a great pub atmosphere for sure.  The servers were professional but clearly not enough of them for the volume of people in the place.   Overall it was just okay.
Stopped in after several friends recommended it.  It was ok. The Caesar salad was run of the mill average.  Did not come with lemon.  The rack of lamb was good.  Tender. The sauce green bean mix that was the bed was soggy tho. The cherry custard was nice.  Hint of cinnamon was a nice surprise. . . On the negative side,  the water was warm.  I requested lemon and it didn't show up until half way through my meal.  The main course was brought out before I had hardly touched my salad.  They took it back.  Which is probably why things were soggy. It took over 15 minutes for the dessert to show up.  I enquired about an herbal tea. They didn't have any,  so I declined.  Then someone shows up with a green tea., which I sent away.. . The kicker was the waiters comment when he brought my check.  He said I had eaten more than anyone he had seen that day and had taken my time.  How rude!  I didn't finish my salad or my dessert.  Not sure how 3 courses is excessive.  Rude!
Have so much to write about this place. . We had a very large group about 15 people and they said we couldn't have so many. But they ended up putting tables together so I am happy they could do this. . The food is unbelievably overpriced. That food is not worth the price. . I got to taste a bunch of things from friends. . The food took sooooo long. I was starving. I got a sprite. $4 for a sprite. That is insane. . Then I ordered the Shepard pie. I only got it because it was recommended. I didn't think it was going to just be ground beef and mashed potatoes. That's worth less than 10 dollars and it was $22. Insane!!! It want even that good. It was just okay. . I also tasted the nachos and they were way better than the Shepard pie. Didn't have much cheese but the chips were good at least. . I also tasted one if the burgers and it was the strangest burger I ever had. It wasn't good. It was also $20. None of that was worth it. . I also tasted the cheesecake which was the best thing I had. I loved it but was still overpriced. And I tasted the toffee and it was yummy but not as great as everyone says. I liked the cheesecake a lot better. . Then we had a huge problem with our bill. It took an entire hour so we could get separate bills. Everyone was so upset and just wanted to leave. They kept shaking they couldn't split the bills until the manager was called and they finally fixed it. I don't recommend this place at all. Maybe just once to try it but u would never come here again.
establishment is great, and quite large. We were immediately greeted and seated. Our waiter was very friendly and made us feel comfortable. I ordered the 12oz NY strip steak MEDIUM RARE.. It took about 30-45minutes and I was quite disappointed. My steak was overcooked, nowhere near medium rare, I could of made a scene and complained but my body was in much need of protein so I ate it and told our waiter to notify the chef about the overcooked steak. They apologized and offered me a new steak but I was in a rush and hungry so I was letting it slide.  Giving it another chance next time I come back to Vegas. . Establishment 4/5. Waiter/Staff 4/5. Food 3/5. Price 2/5 (lower score the pricer it is). Cleanlines 4/5. . Overall 3/5
Simply put..... "Not impressed". Unimpressive menu and we won't be coming back, as there are to many truly better options in this amazing food Mecca.
Best fish n chips I've ever had, and the lobster mac n cheese had huge lobster pieces in every bite!  And Chef Scott came to say hello. Service was awesome for our high maintenance table of 10.
Everything was perfect!. . I got the salmon, which I adored.  Our server was amazing and the appetizer of threepies was perfect!  . . All of our desserts were yummy as well.  Definitely want to return!
I love his show so I was very excited to try his restaurant. What a huge let down. The service was horrid, the music so loud it was hard to carry on a conversation and the food bland at best. If you are looking for boring and flavorless food that the English are known for this is the place for you.
Ok food. Nothing special, very bland. Got lamb burger and the lamb Shepard pie. Good service, but disappointed in the food. Drinks expensive
Grabbed lunch here with my 8 year old.  She recognized the name and wanted to give it a try.  One word can summarized the whole experience for me - meh.
It was not as good as I had hoped. The fish and chips were very good with 2 large pieces of cod with a thin crispy batter.  They could have used a touch more salt, but that is my taste.  . The split pea soup was nice and creamy. . The disappointment was the Shepard pie.  The potato top was good with a crispy top but the amount of peas and root vegetables was small.  The major fault was that the lamb had been seasoned with spices that hid the lambflavor. I thought it had an Indian spice overtone which was uncharacteristic to someone who was born in England. . I enjoyed the Innis and Gun ale.  Not too bitter.. We skipped dessert as we had already tried the Sticky Toffee at the Steakhouse which was very good there.
Sitting for half an hour and still no food. While the workers in the back are screaming and joking around half the restaurant is sending its food back. Finally got burgers that were average at best. Definitely not worth $20 a burger. Staff is rude and service is nonexistent. Don't waste your time or money here. Feel sick already.
We stopped in to enjoy a quick happy hour before heading to the airport.   I'm a bit torn on this one.  It was good but nothing special.  We had the bacon wrapped dates and soft pretzels with our pints. The atmosphere is okay, the service is okay, most things were just okay. The dates and pints were the best part of our visit.

Wow. . . My friends and I had dinner at Gordon Ramsay Pub& Grill inside Caesars Palace and it was incredibly disappointing. Our waitress forgot our drink orders, so she came back to ask us what they were 15 minutes after she promised to get us some glasses. We decided to cancel our drink orders right then and there, because hey, why spend $11 on a beer when you can get drinks for free while gambling? She then brought out our canceled drinks 5 minutes later, reminding us that she had in fact remembered to enter in our drink orders. Uh, what the !@#$? We asked that she take them back.. . Other than the strange drink order situation, the food was nothing more than mediocre. But ridiculously expensive. My stupid salad was $17. The scotch egg appetizer was $11. For one egg. I know prices are high in Vegas, but for the spotty service and so-so food, this is a big no-no.. . I still can't believe this place exists. Shame on you, Gordon Ramsay.
This place was a terrible disappointment. My girlfriend and I stopped by on Friday night on our way back to our room for some drinks. We went into a nearly empty bar and sat at a table for two only to be chased away by a waiter who said tables weren't open seating. We should have left right there. Instead, we went and sat at the bar. I ordered a Goodbye Blue Sky and she ordered a Margarita. My drink was bitter and lacking in any other flavor. Hers was served in a small glass that was half filled with ice. There seemed to be very little alcohol in either. For this, we were charged $15 for each glass (one bad drink and one tiny one). I've paid more other places, but gotten more and better and I came away happy. The next night, we stopped by Numb instead. We had drinks that were better tasting, and stronger for less money. Don't go to Gordon Ramsay's!
This was probably our overall favorite restaurant on our trip because we both had a good experience. I got to go off menu when I requested a vegetarian dish. They waitress offered me the risotto, but then she came back and said the chef wanted to something different and fun. I ended up with a delicious pasta with veggies that had a sour flavor, but was really good. The artichokes and olives complimented the flavor well, and it only ended up being $14! My girlfriend got the shepherd's pie, which she really enjoyed. For dessert, we went with the famous toffee pudding, which did not disappoint. This place didn't blow our minds, but it was definitely the most solid restaurant we ate at on our trip.
Love this restaurant, tried it for the first time in 2013.  Me and my boyfriend reminisced about our food for a year so we had to come back this year.  Mine was amazing, but a little different than the year before.  My boyfriend however was disappointed, the amazing chips from the year before were very different now.  They were soggy and thin cut and nothing like last years thick crispy chips that made us come back :(
We had high expectations when arriving to eat but were quickly disappointed. It was absolutely horrible service. We arrived at 6:30 and did not get our food until around 7:45. Our server was non existent for about 30 min and never checked in on us throughout our meal. Although it was quickly taken careof, the shepherds pie came out cold even after taking over 40 min to receive. I would not recommend this restaurant.
This place is great! The service was wonderful, had a tasting of quite a few items - everything was perfectly executed. Meat pies were ridiculously good, chicken pesto sandwich was my favorite, but prime rib was perfect, lobster Mac was incredible, lamb burger was awesome, sliders were great - everything was perfect in great portion sizes, nothing greasy, messy, etc. Wait staff had great attitudes; met Scott Cummings and he was taking time to greet guests. Just an overall wonderful atmosphere. Did not disappoint!
Excellent place for a casual lunch during our trip to Sin City!  . . We ate at the bar and Ray Ray was fabulous!  Fun, helpful, and attentive.  He helped us find some local faire to enjoy during our week.  Visit him and chat him up!. . For lunch I had the Lamb Burger which was excellent, just slightly over dressed with the feta topping and it had cabbage in it, which I don't love.  Still melt in your mouth delicious!  As always, Drew picked better and had the bangers and mash.  Three different sausages made of different meats with one of the best gravies I've ever had!  . . Beer selection was great, including Boddingtons on nitro!  The beer gods smiled upon us that day.. . The place is spendy so cheapskates don't even bother!  Worth every penny in my opinion, wish we would have eaten here a second time.
Atmosphere and service good.  Food average to below average.  Price for 1 calamari appetizer, 2 burgers w/fries, chips w/fries, 4 drinks, and 1 beer came to $118 before tip. . . I'm hardly an expert but these basic entrees had little flavor.. . Mr. Ramsay, this restaurant needs help!
If our server treated us better I would have give it a 3 stars. But, the only thing he had done is greeting, taking order that's about it.and the only time he show up is when the food is here. Sure, that sounded fair. But, we are running low on water and condiment and would love to ask for the check and he is no where to be find.. . My husband still left him with decent amount of tips because it is Christmas eve( maybe that's the whole reason for inattentive  service?!). . Food is ok.  I ordered the steak medium rare which comes out surprising rare and dry?!. My husband ordered the chicken Breast thankfully it is nice and tender. . The dessert straight forward dead sweet. And it takes about a good 20 mins wait ,but it felt like an hour to me.
Great food - miserable service.  The food is outstanding and reasonably priced for a brand name chef restaurant on The Strip.  The service was slow and inattentive.  Not a positive experience even wit wonderful dishes.
I wanted to eat here for some time...but omg that a bad experience.. The food was cold, and the service was bad.. The NY steak was just cook bad without salt and my wife's fish was cold...never coming back
Really bad for a pub and grill...Gordon should be careful of where his name goes... he needs to visit this place and kick someones rear.....appetizers were good (salmon and scotch egg) . The main course was we'll...the Christmas holiday prime rib meal....only prime was cost for a bad cut of meat (fatty and bad) the Yorkshire pudding tasted like...well nothing, just like dough...the only good thing was the cold beer....wish I would have spent my $100.00 elsewhere on a good meal... just have an appetizer and a beer.....
we went to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving. It is the true Mecca for foodies. Having been a fan of his many cooking reality shows we decided to eat at the grill at Cesars Palace.Things quickly went down hill after being seated in a tiny table stuck next to a row of 4 cramped tables with barely breathing room. Our waiter was the worst I have ever encountered after eating out for 30 years at some of the better to best restaurants in the US and Europe. He repeatedly ignored us and after sitting for 30 minutes without a drink I complained to the management who got us started with our cocktails. This caused our waiter to futher act out in a blatant passive aggressive way. He did not smile, gave us no eye contact but plenty of attitude as he sarcastically announced with each entree "is this good enough for you". I literally wanted to put the food up his U KNOW WHAT but we were hungry and would have been late for our show so we had to put up wth this clown. While ordering, they had 'RUN OUT " of 3 of the 4 items????. Sounded odd. Anyway the shepards pie was ok, the lobster mac and cheese very salty and my memory is a wash with the rest of the meal. Thus I conclude that it must not have been memorable. I was so irritated with this snarky, pompous jack ass of a waiter it was all I could do to contain myself.. The one plus was dessert some kind of bread pudding that was super sweet but definitely the best among the items ordered . Just when I thought things were bad enough I went into the rest room. Had I done that first thing, I would NEVER have eaten at this establishment. It was FILTHY. Yes! you may find it hard to believe, I DID but the smell and look of the toilet was as if they had not cleaned it. Rather disgusting what was on the toilet seat thus I will NOT describe it in case you are as visual as I am. I still can't get the imagery out of my mind a month later. When it came to soap supplies, they had 1 little bottle of soap for 4 sinks and plenty of patrons waiting like kindergardeners to get a squirt of the stuff. A 50 plus year old to my left erupted and questioned the staff and was seen on my way out complaining to upper management. Tell you what, for such a fussy chef with his noteriety of perfectionistic standards, he should visit the place he sold his name to on the sly and see for himself. A real let down and all around dive with absolutely lazy staff that needs a major attitude over haul. I would never recommend this place.
Went on 12/28/14 at 8:30 pm. They were out of salmon, prime rib, short ribs, and NY strip. Fish and chips...fish was like a cold brick and fries were just like burger king's. They have a mini pie sampler that used to come in a cute wooden carrier and last night they just plopped them on a plate and brought them to us. Took 2 hours and $500 for 8 people to eat. Go somewhere else.
Never been to a real pub that didn't have budweiser.  Suck it Ramsey.
We ended up at this place because it had the shortest wait among other places in the vicinity and when everyone was going crazy for the buffet!! . We visited on Christmas day so naturally they were short-staffed. But the waiter was really nice and friendly and tried to make our experience a good one. . I ordered the scallops, it was good but it wasn't to die for. There were too many shallots in the dish and the sauce. . . The atmosphere is very nice and chic, and I really liked the furniture and the decor.
Food is not that good and way over priced. Fish and Chips $30 for 2 pieces of fish. Fish was runny. Service is horrible.
I went to Caesars Palace to eat at the Bacchanal buffet for dinner. Unfortunately it was filled to capacity, we were turned away. So we opted for Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill.  What a mistake!. . We order the fish and chips  ($30). I've had better fish and chips at Long John Silvers and H Salt. The fish was dried out and crumbly. The French fries were soggy and limp.   For $30 definitely not worth it. . . The Mac and cheese with lobster ($28).  I've had better Mac and cheese out of a box, really!  The sauce was watery And the few tiny bits of lobster were not so tasty. . . The steak and ale pie. Basically it's a Shepard's pie made with beef instead of lamb.  The crust was soggy and the meat was so tasteless. . . I'd like to invite Gordon Ramsey to go and dine on some of this cuisine that bears his name. I don't think he'd approve. . . Very very pricey for less than average tasting food.
