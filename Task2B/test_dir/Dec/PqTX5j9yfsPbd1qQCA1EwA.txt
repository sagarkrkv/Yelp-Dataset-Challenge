Great club, the best music we heard, best atmosphere, great place to dance. Staff was friendly, no pushy bouncers and my girls and I got into the club for FREE, who could ask for anything better? One weird thing, when we entered the club, its about 8 bathtubs filled with water and rose petals and it was two girls sitting in the tubs, not together, they each had their own tub, but still, a tub, a club, WEIRD, nonetheless. As we entered the dance floor area, it was another tub with water and rose petals and another girl, I tried to understand their purpose all night. Overall, an awesome and amazing time was had by all in attendance.
Coming from the Miami night scene.. I had incredibly high expectations for Tao nightclub. There are things I loved: the Asian decor, the hassle-free entrance (if you're staying in the hotel or dine at the restaurant), and the music.. . We had dinner at the restaurant so we had to go back out to the entrance to get our bracelets before heading upstairs to the club. Once inside, it was nearly impossible to reach any of the bars.. This place was PACKED!! There was no way to walk through without pushing up against everyone (not my favorite thing). We finally got to a spot were our group could dance and move comfortably.. . I was very surprised at how people were dressed. I know I'm about to sound incredibly snobby, but girls in flip flops, flats, guys in khakis or polos... This just wouldn't happen in Miami. I'll definitely visit again when I'm back in Vegas though... Nothing is better than no hassle to get in.
Partying at Tao nightclub is a MUST !!! Every time I visit Vegas (about 5 or more times a year) I make sure to take my group of girls to one of the livest, spacious, and coolest clubs on the strip -- Tao- and we are never disappointed. I always make sure to contact the club promoter Chris Cash to maximize my experience with guest list priority and other club information which is very helpful, convenient and advantageous :) Chris always takes care of me! I assume he doesn't mind me listing his number on here so ladies and gentleman if you are planning on going to Vegas anytime soon be sure to hit up Chris for Club Tao !!! I promise you won't be disappointed. . Chris's # 714-234-7325.
This is a nice place to hangout with your friends... Restrooms are clean.. Watch out for the drinks you order
We bought the dinner/nightclub package for my daughters 21st. . I don't know who the the PRIOR reviewers ARE, (you did have me all ready to piss and bitch) but I'm a huuuuge snob abut service and food. . . BOTH WERE SERIOUSLY THE BEST IVE EVER HAD. THE. BEST. . I thought I would have to suffer thru a night of mediocre, having read the reviews. But they could NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG!. I would go back, pay that big chunk of change for the package with the table after dinner - IN A HEARTBEAT! And IM TOO OLD TO NORMALLY WANT TO DO THAT SHIT! But the staff made it so fun for all of us!!!!. Hopefully, get Charles. Nick. Ricky. Savanna. . CHARLES as a waiter. Nick as the whatever funny cool guy that walks you in.  Ricky and Savanna in the club. . It was such an amazingly fun night - mostly because of the staff. We felt like ROYALTY! You guys rock, thank you sooooo much!!
I brought my Asian girlfriend (yeah that's right...she's Asian) here because there were some kind of Asian looking symbols and characters on a billboard here in Los Angeles and since we both hate our families, we went to Vegas over Thanksgiving to mutually grind away our despair.. . I've always heard great things about Tao, so my expectations were fairly high. Tao is like the girl in high school with overly developed breasts who you desperately want to ask out on a date, but you always puss out and walk past her, ashamed and blueball-ridden.. . The music was pretty cool (anyone who plays "In Da Club" automatically wins my vote), but the dance floor was tiny, and obviously packed to the absolute fucking brim. It was just very underwhelming. But they get an extra star because there were two topless chicks in a bath tub together. And the old guy filming them on his iPhone gets five stars.. . There are much better clubs in Vegas, but if you can get in free somehow, check it out for an hour.
Honestly if you don't have a shit ton of money to spend, don't waste your time going. There is very little space for the non-vip folk to dance and people are very vigilant about those who they let in their section. I was lucky I got in for free because if I had to pay I would have been pissed.
Not bad. But if ur a dude. It doesn't matter what u spend. Bathroom line is ridiculous. Not worth the cover. If ur a dude. Don't come. .
Eli makes this place worth visiting. Such a great experience from start to end. Both TJ and Eli made us feel like royalty:)
I hate giving bad reviews based off silly stuff but damn it killed our whole mood. This was the last stop on a party bus club crawl for us and we had a blast all night at every stop. We get here and continue drinking like everywhere else and of course had to pee when we get there as we were making many stops with many drinks. . . We literally sat in line for the mens bathroom for 22 minutes. There was a bouncer controlling the flow in and out and when we FINALLY got in there there it wasnt full for each urinal and stall that could have been in use. Stupidest process I've ever seen at a club, it killed our mood as we were really excited to keep partying at that point so we just left and went somewhere else. . . If you want people to keep drinking have adequate bathrooms bro, if you don't make the in and out process easy, not difficult, not rocket science bouncer boy
Nice place to dance and enjoy drinks. Went on a Saturday night and even though the promoter said we were on the VIP guest list, we still had to wait in this long line with the rest of the "VIPs" lol. Got in, girls got free drinks till 10:30. A random couple invited us to their VIP table (the real deal), we partied next to Scotty McCreedy (American Idol winner 2012). . The music was awesome! The DJ was just amazing, speaking for myself cause I know every one has their taste in music. . Apart from the whole "VIP but wait in line" fiasco, I had a great time. I will definitely be coming again!
Tao has two levels: the first being an sitting-down restaurant and lounge space, and the second, the dance floor, Visited with a friend on their Friday "Persian Night" -- in general good music and ambiance, but too crowded and very overpriced ($40 per ticket, same for men and women). Figured Tao really excelled at marketing. For the same price and time wait in line, I'm sure there are many better options.
Had a blast here. The other clubs try way too hard. Tao is just plain fun! Nice staff, great music, and strong drinks. Couldn't find anything bad to say. Went here and to Marquee while I was in Vegas and I will only be returning here.
I've always liked the setup at Tao but beware of getting a table at this place. We got a table $1500 min right next to the dj booth. As we were half way through our second bottle I closed the tab. Within a few minutes someone from the club management came to us and said we can't have more than 10 people at our table. That is the most ridiculous thing I've heard. The reason to get a table is so you can bring guests over. Several of our guys had to leave our table for most of the night and hang out by the bar so we could have a few female guests over. We finally got a third bottle and the management left us alone.
