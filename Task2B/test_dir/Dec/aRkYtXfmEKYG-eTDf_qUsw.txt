Just awesome... If you go, you'll see why. If you don't like awesome coffee and stellar chow, don't go. :-)
Aree you kidding the COOLEST coffee/lunch/snack/lounge spot for the coolest best vibest from those people that appreciate all the above. Such a great feeling, and this coffee is the best I've ever had.. definitely appreciate infinitively this business/concept/friendly environment. If you dig coffee and cool people coooome!!!
Nothing best praise, absolutely great. Had the grilled chicken pesto mac n' cheese yesterday. AMAZING!
Great coffee and laid back environment. I like the sectioning of different rooms and not just one big room like most coffee shops. Usually 1 or 2 rooms will be quiet with most people working on their mobile device, and the rest of the shop will be very social and talkative. It's a great place to relax or socialize, whatever your mood may be!
amazing coffee!
Coming from Portland, Oregon, I know a few things about coffee... and my addiction to not only the flavor but the buzz. Lux is an Oasis in the Desert. After moving here, we found Lux, thankfully. This isn't only our go to coffee in Phoenix, it's the very best in town, and could hold it's own with some roasters in the NW.
My wife and I finally visited, and we loved it. Its laid back.  The Mac and Cheese was delicious, along with the espresso cake. I loved the ice tea. I would certainly recommend this place. Grab a seat, drink a tea, and have a good day.
Lux is popular for sure - but it's not my cup of coffee.  Tough for parking, tight spaces on the interior as well and average products.
Great coffee, food, and pastries. I really like this place. It is always packed though, so expect to look for seating. They even have a nice craft beer selection. This is a great coffee shop for hanging out, but I might not study here due to how packed it gets.
Great Coffee, great food, Great scene
this has to do a lot with one's opinion, however the place is nice.  laid back atmosphere, also having a Macbook Pro almost seems like a requirement to sip on some mocha at this place :)  my only complaint is that waiting in line and waiting for my coffee was just plain ackward.  the way the set up is...I'm sure it sounded good in therory
I love going here. I really, really do, just to have that said off the bat. But there are some important things to understand about Lux.. . 1) Seating is always limited. Not even on a Tuesday night in July will this place be quiet and empty. Own that fact, love it, and keep looking.. . 2) The cocktails are phenomenal. There's no list of specialty cocktails. They go by requests for what you like, and make something that percolates in their brains all quick like. They also use beautiful glassware, which is really nice when you think about how rare that is.. . 3) It's actually kind of unfortunate that the cocktails eclipse the food. Lux is probably some of the best food you can get at its price point. If you think $19 for a steak is too much, just order it and keep in mind you'd pay $25 for cooking on that order at any other establishment. The same goes for literally everything else their fabulous cooks prepare. You can't go wrong with the soup, and I assure you the mac & cheese is a full meal.. . 4) They actually have newspapers! Real ones that you hold with your hands for the patrons to enjoy and leave behind! That basically makes Lux one of the most active town halls in the city of Phoenix.. . 5) They play full albums of good music, and not just rando indie bands people brag about having heard of. This is a place that appreciates Beyonce as much as all those weird bands whose names you can't remember.. . There are a lot of things I don't understand about Lux. I don't get why people take selfies with their lattes. I don't understand why they have a DJ, but I'm glad he has a regular gig. I don't understand  why there are non-functional typewriters strewn about the place. But you know what? I keep coming back. We all keep coming back.
Super Coffee on Central Avenue.
Best coffee in Phoenix. Gets really crowded on weekend mornings and at night so bring your patience and don't be a jerk. Excellent red wine selection and MOST of the bartenders know how to make a killer cocktail. There are a few questionable bartenders but I'm sure they will go the way of the dodo in time. Baristas are all very quick and accurate. Everything here is totally slap in the face delicious.
Ah... Lux. This review is hard to write because I am so torn!. . The pros:. *Amazing coffee - my fav is the iced velvet.. It tastes like a piece of red velvet cake. *Their homemade whip cream! *drools*. *Their assortment of baked goods. *Their salads and lunch foods. *So many different places to sit inside and cozy up. . Cons:. *Staff- this is where they lose points for me. I have only encountered maybe 2 friendly people who work here. there is one gal in particular who REALLY needs to freshen up on her customer service skills. I mean really... It's scary how unfriendly she is. . *The fact that you basically have to beg them to put whip cream on your drink. I'm sure a lot of people don't even know they have whip cream. They keep it in this hidden container in their fridge and they skimp on it big time - depending on who is working. *If you're not hipster, you are going to stick out like a sore thumb. I usually come in my work out attire and people typically look at me like I have just sprouted an extra head. It's quite comical. *They stop serving breakfast at a certain time (I can never remember what time) but they keep the breakfast menu up all day and when you ask for something from the breakfast menu, one of the suuuuper friendly (sarcasm) baristas will bark at you that breakfast is over.. Which you are then forced to go back and look at the small food menu that is printed on a piece of paper and all of the hipsters who are in line get super annoyed at you. I'm sorry I'm not a regular who comes 5 times a week, I guess I don't know the protocol?!!. . . Anyways, I continue to come for 2 reasons.. The amazing coffee and the fact that it is middle meeting ground for my best friend and I.. . If you go, and you're not hipster, just make sure you are prepared for their snobby attitudes and you will be just fine ;)
I won't say much here because...well...it's probably already been said.  Here's the quick run down:. . We went Thanksgiving morning and it was packed (which I love).  The ambiance is, like, textbook hipster, I think.  Some rugged wood, funky lamps, deviant art and coffee.  Not to mention a few fedora hats, skinny jeans and beards (but those weren't exclusive to the establishment).  I dug it.. . Price. Eh, steep, but not too bad.. . The food was delicious.  I got the savory pancake and it was totally not what I had envisioned, but it was awesome and I would so get it again.. . Service was friendly and customer positive.  The one thing I didn't like was their pick up system.  I didn't know what I was supposed to do.  It was loud, so I didn't know if we'd hear our names or not.  We stood near the counter but somehow still missed our drinks.  Apparently they got cold so they set them aside (understood), but I don't know how we didn't hear them...so, yeah, the system didn't work for us.  Otherwise, the folks met are needs and were totally cool when we asked where our teas were.. . Worth trying, and we might go back (I'm not a frequent anywhere...except my own kitchen).
I love this place! Best coffee in town and super friendly staff.
People are friendly, desserts are good, foods are delicious and made fresh. I go there almost everyday I enjoy it so much.
My wife and I finally visited, and we loved it. Its laid back.  The Mac and Cheese was delicious, along with the espresso cake. I loved the ice tea. I would certainly recommend this place. Grab a seat, drink a tea, and have a good day.
Just an excellent place for coffee and a snack (great desserts).  A great place for all ages.  Wifi is open so connect, drink and eat.  Nothing better.
Great coffee, cool building.  The crowd is a cross between over aged hipsters still trying to hang on and newbie hipsters trying to create a faux urban lifestyle in Phoenix.
I love LUX! Best coffee and place to hangout in Phoenix.
this place is the best place for coffee
People are friendly, desserts are good, foods are delicious and made fresh. I go there almost everyday I enjoy it so much.

The home made food is delicious and the service is always warm and inviting. The drinks are made with love, you can tell. It's a popular place so it's sometimes hard to find seating.
The atmosphere is pretty nice, but the food is only meh. I found everything to be overpriced, and the tea that I had was nothing spectacular.
Six dollar for a cup of half coffee and half foam and to be lectured by the employee early in the morning for where to line up.  This is robbing, right?  Take my money and punch me in the face.
A Central Phoenix delight. I am an espresso fan and the quality is consistent. Good prepared foods in the morning and fresh cooked starts at 7am.
cool people, cool vibes
great coffee here
Eclectic atmosphere. Constantly changing baked goods, as the staff is baking all the time. The bartender literally crafts each cocktail like it is a work of art. The macaroni and cheese with bacon is phenomenal.The staff is incredible. Huge cups of coffee with free refills.You simply cannot get a bad item in this place. If you like artsy, unique, one of a kind finds,with truly quality food and drink, this is your place.
Best iced mocha around! Super chill vibes, great hipster creepin' if that's your jam.
I am so in love with this place its not even funny. Everything about it is spectacular. I go here every single chance I get, really. The coffee is divine!
I've started becoming a regular at Lux because of their amazing mochas and homemade whipped cream. They have a great atmosphere with interesting art on the walls and tables as well as cool, interesting music. The place is also full of interesting, friendly people.
Just admit to being a hipster already and you'll fit right in! Best red velvet cake ever!
I stopped in here for breakfast and a coffee and was pretty surprised by the experience. I expected some hipster coffee shop with so-so food and was I wrong. . The latte was a delicious, drinkable work of art. I love foam art and their latte presentation was beautiful. I ordered scrambled eggs and bacon for breakfast. They came out quick and tasted like they were made in my moms kitchen. The eggs were fluffy and the bacon was thick cut and a bit peppery. Yum!!!!. I shared a table with two total strangers who turned out to be very nice people. One lived around the corner and the other traveled across town to eat here. I'll be back for sure!!
Consistently good coffee.
The atmosphere(s) (as there are several rooms each with its own vibe), food and beverages are all excellent. So glad I live so close. I just moved here and to have a coffee shop like this, truly one of the best I have ever been to in the U.S., is a huge benefit. The two times I have been I had the quiche which was scrumptious, I did get it twice after all. Come by, you will not be disappointed and you will go away happy.
My iced coffee was really good.  The place was pretty crowded and had a nice vibe about it.  Music wasn't my favorite but not bad.  The only negative comment I have is the furniture is really kind of gross.  It is almost like they got it from curbside on garbage day! lol  I would go back though.
Simple....Rude pretentious hipsters. . . I don't understand it. I was so hesitant on coming here because I was afraid of this. . . I walked in, no one was in line. So I walked up to the cash register. Stood for a minute while the girl rang someone up. Finally a young man helped me, but first he just felt the need to educate me at how it works at LUX. Instead of, "Hi, what can I get for you!?" I got a, "Just so you know the line starts back at the glass, what can I get for you?" Really!? Is this real life!? How about the line starts wherever the heck your customer wants it to start, because I am paying your paycheck. Nonetheless, I was now at the cash register and realized he didn't ask how I wanted my tea. I then asked  the girl at the register if I can get creme in my tea, and the girl annoyingly told me I could do it myself. Stood and waited for my tea, and realized they must not call out your order at LUX. I walked up to the register (because why would you have a place to pick up your drinks?) and asked if these were mine, which took 3 tries before she yelled at me, "yeah!" . . Now was my drink amazing? Absolutely not. . . So with that said, they will never get my business again.
I am so in love with this place its not even funny. Everything about it is spectacular. I go here every single chance I get, really. The coffee is divine!
When in Cenpho it's definitely a must go! It's not often I'm in central Phoenix but when I am Lux is my go to coffee spot! Open until 2am, serving coffee until midnight, morning, noon or night this is the place to be! It's relaxed atmosphere makes it the perfect place to grab a corner, sip a coffee or tea, have a cocktail, a bite to eat, a quick treat, work, study, or to just hang out with friends. The coffee is made to order served and designed with flare, feels like a toasty warm hug in a cup! The black and white is my absolute favorite! Even when ordering the to go cups they've taken time to add their foam design flowers or hearts, good to the last drop it's coffee made with love! Add one of their delicious baked goods with plenty of varieties to choose from(loved the blueberry white chocolate cookies) including vegan & gluten free and you're tastebuds will be in hipster heaven! I have yet to really eat their food, except for the amazing Mac N Cheese with jalapenos & bacon, it's comfort food with a kick! I love everything about this place, I'll be back soon!
Definitely not my scene! Very urban feel. I got a weird vibe. Perhaps too many judge-y twenty-somethings at one time. . . Their tea is good and inexpensive! . . I couldn't wait to get out of the building though... too much going on at one time. It was overwhelming.
People are friendly, desserts are good, foods are delicious and made fresh. I go there almost everyday I enjoy it so much
One of my favorite places of all time for amazing coffee and the best baked goodies!  This is my happy place
This place has a really cool vibe and very tasty food.  Lux is a winner!
If you are looking for the best latte in Phoenix this is your place. Awesome homemade pastries and quiches galore. Get here early enough on the weekend as the lines do get long!
I love this place! The pastries are amazing the coffee is amazing. Very relaxing and cozy. Great service too. ;)
The place is OK. We went here as it is rated by some as the best place in Phoenix metro to get an espresso. Yeah, it's better than Starbucks (not hard to do) and they roast their own coffee, but it's a blend & they don't do anything special with the beans. Food was just ok too. It's also very crowded. Maybe some rate this as the best coffee house to go because it is 'hip, ' but I don't go to a coffee shop (nor buy appliances/electronics/clothing etc. ) for its 'brand,' but for the product. I wouldn't avoid the place but it's not a place I'd frequent even if it was close to home as the line - at least the day we went in the summertime - was ridiculously long & the place was uncomfortably crowded. Sorry, but Cartel wins as the best metro coffee joint to me.
The juice, coffee, tea, pastries are all probably fine. I haven't had any of the food except the hash and that was fine. The staff sport hipsterish looks who are allergic to humor and happiness. No one even say hi or tries to crack a smile, which is a bit rude, but I don't even care about that. This isn't about the business itself, but just the awful, rude people who flock here.. . Being that this is the only coffeeshop that stays opened later and has large tables, it's hard to not go here for the space availability. Contrary to most of the reviewers here due to lack of understanding of what hipsters are truly like, the majority of patrons are actually the type of people who bring their laptops in and pretend to study but are actually stalking their exs on Facebook. Real hipsters would not flock here because this place is too trendy and full of yuppies. I hate yuppies too, but I'm not a hipster. I come to sew when my school's sewing lab is closed. Not only do I have to sew for school, but I will do it because that's my line of work. I even saw some chick knitting which made me very happy. Point is, most people tend to come here to do something.. . Normally, there are douches, wannabes, and plenty of pretentiousness and they often contain themselves to a certain area. I accepted the crudeness masquerading in yuppie or techie attire who don't respect your space or what you are doing and just interrupts you like you owe them your attention. No "excuse me," no "thank you," no "sorry to interrupt." Nothing remotely resembling any sort of respect towards others. I fucking HATE being talked "at." I am not someone who ignores people, but due to the lack of people with good manners, I had no choice but to learn to ignore those who are not polite towards me... like the overweight beer bellied bearded lumberjack Bon Iver-wannabe techie in the Wordpress jacket who not only interrupted my phone convo without acknowledging that I was on the phone but was rushing me to get out of my seat so his fatass basic white bitch gf could sit there.. . Going here is sorta like a test for people who have sensibilities that isn't as crude as gorilla toenails. That alone pushes me to try harder in finding other places that stayed opened later and had decent tables but attract more genuine, down to earth people, so I go here a lot less than before.. . But what happened yesterday really broke this camel's bac enough to make me never return.. . I found 1 parking spot left in the lot at around 3pm and an overweight skank on goddess-mode wearing very revealing leggings was yakking on her latest iPhone was standing in the spot. I honked my horn and she said she's saving the spot. I told her that's fucking bullshit and these parking spaces are first come, first serve- there is no reserved parking. She diva hair flipped ignored me. OH. HELL. NO. I was ready to pull into the space, take off my glasses, get out of my car and beat that silly fat hoe. But no...I thought rationally, I should just roll up my windows and leave. I find a very close spot on the street and park there to scream obscenities for a good 10 minutes until my murderous rage came to a manageable level.. . NEVER in my entire life have I had to deal with such stupidity over a parking space just because some lazy bitch would rather risk getting run over just because her fat entitled feet were too delicate to walk a few more seconds to a coffeeshop. Not in Boston and the drivers there are the creme de la creme of assholery. Not in NYC and yes I was brave enough to drive there. Not on the hilly, foggy streets of San Francisco whether there was a gay parade or not. And certainly not in my hometown of LA where there's virtually no parking lots and you parallel park wherever you can. But yes, this bullshit had to happen in an unimportant, uncool suburban sprawl full of provincial assholes who never get out of this backwards state and thinks life revolves around mediocrity and mainstream mall crap.. . I've already had more than enough.
People are friendly, desserts are good, foods are delicious and made fresh. I go there almost everyday I enjoy it so much. The coffee is divine!
I love Lux.  They roast their own beans, make their own pastries.  And the breakfast menu is fantastic.  I am a devout devourer of Aunt Gladys (with avocado on the side).  And for a bit of sweet and savory, pair it with the Belgian pancake with mixed berries!. . The DJ is a nice touch.  Everyone can do with a bit of mood enhancement in the morning.. . I complained once... and the manager responded.  He was attentive and earnest.. . As for the hip vibe... yes, it's all that - so the hipster admonishments in the other posts are a bit gratuitous.  If you don't like hipsters, go to Starbucks.  But, that is more about personal choice.  . . If I have one ongoing peeve, it relates to the made-to-order food ordering.  I don't get the concept of running coffee orders before you reach the register - so that by the time you pay, the steaming brew is at the counter.  Why they don't extend the same service to food ordering is maddening.  The line can run out the door.  So, one stands in line for a good 15 mins to then have to place a food order and wait another 10-15mins for it to be ready.  PLEASE change that process.. . Otherwise... LUX is my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix!
Great coffee shop, even better pastries! They have at least half a dozen different types of scones to choose from, amongst other things, and the size of the scones are huge!! We got the strawberry vanilla bean scone to share, and the SO got the espresso macchiato while I got the chai latte. It's a very hipster vibe and the place was packed and overflowing at 1030AM on a Sunday, but the staff are super efficient and we got out order in no time at all. The scone is moist and very flavorful, and I wished I had gotten afew more to try. The SO liked his macchiato, I thought my chai was just standard. Overall, a great little spot for Sunday brunch or a meetup with friends!
This is my favorite shop in the world.. The coffee, the pastries and food are amazing.. They have the best service and the design and the changing art makes this place unique..
I am so in love with this place its not even funny. Everything about it is spectacular. I go here every single chance I get, really. The coffee is divine.
