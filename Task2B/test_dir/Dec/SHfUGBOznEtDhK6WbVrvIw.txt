First order of business upon reaching Montreal.. . Got 1 fatty, 1 regular smoked meat sandwich + fries.. . My advice: just get the fatty sandwich. No point getting to Schwartz's and not going all out, fat is flavour! Also, would skip the fries, while they were good, save your appetite for the enormous sandwich!
I LOVED this place! I've had my share of smoked meats in NY (Katz, 2nd Ave Deli, Carnegie), but this place was completely comparable. The smoked meat sandwich was exactly the right portion with lots of meat smoked to perfection and not too salty (a huge pet peeve of mine is when meat/food in general is too salty). The mustard to go along with this was great as well. I highly recommend stopping by if you get the chance! . . Note: since the line went out the door for the restaurant, we went next door to the takeout shop and ate in the back -- perfect if you're with a small group and want to enjoy the food without the wait.. . -L.
LOVE this place. Was in Montreal for a weekend recently and had to hit up this place and get my dose of medium smoked meat sandwich with pickles. Had to wait in line as usual but it was well worth it. Remember if you're planning to eat inside, have enough cash on you because that's all they accept. If you decide to get take out (you have to use the side door on the left if you decide to do that, which will save you from waiting in line for half an hour) then you can pay with cash / credit / debit. May I also suggest you get a sealed / packaged pack of meat on your way out after you're done eating because you're gonna crave more of this meat after a few hours. While the packaged meat is a bit thinner, and not AS good as the fresh stuff they serve at the restaurant, the meat is still pretty decent! They pack all packaged meat the same morning so you can be sure it is quite fresh and they last about a week in your fridge, but I assure you will eat them well before then.  Bon apetit
Try this place during a week night or when weather is bad, so that you can actually sit and enjoy your food.. . Definitely recommended if you like beef ;)
We braved the wintry weather to visit this "must eat" place. Unfortunately, it was a let down. The meat has a nice smoked flavor but isn't really anything amazing. The rye bread is plain and the fries were very greasy and limp. Was hoping for better. Cash only.
Exactly what I was expecting given all the reviews and it met expectations, actually exceeded them in that I guess this is the time of year to go because we walked up at 1130AM and no line or anything, got a table to ourselves and enjoyed every moment.  . . Smoked meat sandwiches were great (we had the mediums), the pickle was actually my favorite part of the meal (sooooo good).  My wife and I split an order of fries that came out very hot.  Food came out so fast. Staff was friendly and spoke immediately in English.  Great experience on a freezing day in Montreal.  . . Cash only for those that are used to only carrying plastic
Holy cow was I full after I left there.  Service was fast, prices were good and the sandwich was HUGE. hehe.
When I think of smoked meat, I thought it would be dry, dry and dry. However, when I try the smoked meat at Schwartz's, I was amazed by how juicy and flavorful it can be. I am now a believer of the Schwartz's smoked meat, not sure if it is the best out there, but definitely the best I've tried. I was so excited to buy some for home back in Toronto, but it is not the same as having it there (although it is still good)! So for those of you that tried "take-out" and about to jump into conclusion, please be mindful that the take-out clearly does not justify! Tips: order the fatty part of the smoked meat; it might not sound like a healthy idea but definitely a good idea once you take a bite!
Man I guess I was lucky enough to visit Schwartz's when there wasn't a line out the door! Then again is was January and about 4 degrees out. Don't get me wrong it was packed but I quickly found seats at the counter. Super friendly, quick and easy guysworking there, although they let me order toooo much meat haha Like the large plate. I ate it ALL, even extra pickles and bread and fries. and I didn't even feel bad about it.. . Good God Damn that meat is soo good!
Arrived around 500-530pm and just beat the crowd. Our party of 7 was first in line.  The place is a bit snug but you'll soon forget once you're served their smoked meat. Rib eye was pretty tasty and im a fan of mustard so loved the concoction with bread.  I didn't get to try their drink but heard nothing but good comments on it.
I was worried that this place would have lost its charm once Celine Dion took over but they didn't skip a beat. Smoked meat was delicious as usual and the bread and pickle were the same old. Phew!
Meilleur smoke meat a Montreal. Une des rares place cosmopolitisme ou toutes les classes sociales et tous les ethnies cohabitent ensemble. Schwartz est une representation de ce que Montreal a de plus beau.
The meat is very good, and they offer three different cuts: lean, medium, and fatty. The smell of the place is also very nice and smells like cancer, in a good way, just like their sandwiches. The only problem is the wait, which may take an hour or more depending on when you go, which is unfortunate and makes this place not worth it unless there's a shorter line.
It's a great walking nabe, so don't be afraid to come here early (before 11), beat the crowd, and eat well. Personally, I like to start at Avenue du Mont-Royal and walk down towards Sherbrooke, . . The reason this is a 5-star (or 8-star or 11-star place) is because they do it right. There is never a bad bite in a Schartz's smoked meat sandwich, and that should be enough to garner four stars right there.. . And, it is a sandwich - you can actually eat it with your hands. There's some more stars. This isn't the Carnegie Deli, selling you something eight inches high that you can't bite into, this is a real sandwich. Enjoy.. . Plus, they treat you right, with a simple deli professionalism that gets you fed quickly and gives you time to enjoy. The sides are perfect deli style, nothing's been re-imagined and fusioned and brought into the 21st century, this is the real thing, traditional, and perfect.. . Why bother if its "just" a perfect smoked meat sandwich? Well, if you like your brisket and you like your pastrami and you like your corned beef, you probably want this while you're in town, and there is none better. There are, I am told, places that are "about" as good - this one is definitely great. So beat the crowd, and go!
I've had the brisket before in a sandwich and it was excellent.. . I stopped by recently for some take out.  The guy at the counter told me that they only allow you to order take out of brisket if you order the entire thing, which is about 10-12 pounds.  That's too much brisket for me, so I settled for the smoked meat which they do allow take out by the pound.  Their smoked meat is excellent.. . Service was prompt, although not necessarily friendly.   Then again, you're really just looking to get your meat and go - not make new friends.
If you're a foodie and find yourself in Montreal, make sure you find yourself at Schwartz's.. . The line for sit down is long, but the line for take out is short and since it's all about the food, that's what you'll do! . . I got a smoked meat sandwich and the smoked meat poutine. Wow, is that meat delicious! The sandwich competes with anything you'd get at a NY deli. That's a huge compliment from a snob like me. And the poutine OMG the poutine, this thing is an attack of yummy. I live in Wisconsin and certify that those cheese curds are as fresh and squeaky as they come. Combined that with meat, fries and gravy and you have yourself a bowl of heaven!
Its just ordinary smoked meat. The place is very crowded and there is usually a huge waiting line outside the door. I dont get why its so popular. I do like their tea though.
I really enjoyed my smoked meat sandwich and pickle!
Below average.. Too much fat in the meat, not enough bread to hold the meat making it difficult to actually eat the sandwich. Visited Montreal and thought this was a special place to check out, but now I simply can't recommend it.
Sublime! Smoked meat (brisket) is a reason to visit Montreal. Perfectly pink, melt-in-your-mouth tender, well seasoned, and trimmed in scrumptious fat... You must have this in your life... And I only tried 1/4 lb.. . Undoubtedly 5 stars and assuredly a must do on every and all trips to Montreal. I was lukewarm to the idea of making a point to visit a Jewish deli in Quebec. How and why would a "deli" be a destination.  Even though I saw quotes from an American Francophile celebrity chef imploring tourists to visit Schwartz's I remained non-plussed.. . Then I asked my tour guide a life long Montrealer an open question, "What Quebecois food must I be sure to eat?" - expecting to be told to try pouting or venison, I was surprised when he said our smoked meats and that redoubled when he said Schwartz's is one of the best in the province.. . That piqued my interest but I foolishly did not set an intent on this as a destination. Instead I chanced upon it while strolling on St. Laurent and decided to grab some takeout. I was able to order by the pound and being very full at the time only ordered a quarter pound for me and Erin to share.
I heard a lot about this place having the best smoked meat in town and the long lines out the door in the bitter cold led me to believe that it was true.  I can tell you that wasn't my experience at all . I thought the meat was ok flavor-wise, but it was exceptionally dry and the sandwiches were quite small for the price of almost $9. Final verdict is go for the service and atmosphere but I think you get much better smoked meat at Reuben's.
