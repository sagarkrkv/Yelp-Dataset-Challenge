Stayed at Bally's for our most recent trip to Vegas.  They are located mid-strip, which makes it an ideal location for walking around and seeing most of the other hotels, without wearing yourself out completely.  Check-in took a bit of time, we waited for about 30 minutes in the line while two staff members tried to work through a line of about 25-30 people. When we were second in line to get checked-in they finally had one more staff member start checking others in.. . The room was clean and had a decent view of the strip, and like most hotels on the strip it was a bit of a walk from the front door of the hotel to our room since the overall building is huge.. . They have a variety of things that you can do within the hotel, aside from the obvious gambling.  They have several restaurants and it's a great feature that they are attached and have a walk-through to the Paris Hotel - which has tons of restaurants and shows of their own.. . Check out was much easier than check-in since we just had to sign offon the rapid check out form and drop it in a box by the check-in area. . . Overall: B+. We would stay here again when we go back - no real complaints. Middle of the strip makes it super convenient.
pretty great hotel as far as rooms, location, gaming is concerned but resort fees added to comp rooms is mandatory now. If the Internet speed were acceptable I wouldn't care so much but at one half a mbps !!! soo lame. stick with 4G folks
Great casino ! Friendly employees. Great location on the center of the strip. A place to go. Affordable.
This is by far the worst place I have ever stayed in Las Vegas. The room does not event have a coffee maker. They shut down room service at 1 pm... but they claim it is available until 1 am. The rooms are dirty, nothing works.. what a joke! Do not book here.
Holy Crap! This place still exists?!. . What kind of deal did they cut with the Devil to allow such a bland, no-name hotel to continue operating on such a vital part of the strip? . . Who do they even cater to?! Time travelers from the 1980's who don't know any better?
beware of bedbugs!! stayed there just for a night, next day recognized bedbug bites all over my body and face. Don't waste your money on this creepy hotel especially if you are allergic to insects or don't wanna give bedbugs a ride to your place! Im just disgusted!
We booked through expedia indigo tower suite for 40/nite. Awesome deal. At check in (9pm) after getting off flight, clerk says there's no way it's a suite room because price is to low and I should call expedia, because "its a mistake" ugh, no. Spoke to manager showed her confirmation from expedia and she says that was an awesome deal and that its obviously correct. As the previous clerk pouted like it was coming out of her pocket...she gave us our key. . . Got to room 533 indigo tower suite. Room is awesome, view is okay. ,you can see the high roller of linq hot. Spa tub is huge, 2 bathrooms, spectacular vaniety with excellent lighting..was a plus because its useful for us girls applying makeup. . . Shower was horrible! Had to let water run for at least 7 minutes before it got remotely warm.. . Walk was pretty far from elevators, and even farther from the strip due to construction..thats the overall reason for lack of stars. Use monorail to get to side of strip of venetian, harrahs and cesars palace. Use paris back enterance to go to planet hollywood, etc.

WORSE PLACE EVER! DONT STAY HERE!!! do not recommend to stay here at all! Tried it because our host booked us the celebrity suite it was nice, but customer service is horrible ! We are here today again hoping that they have a better service since , and that we were told we will have the suite again,  with our whole family with children and mom on oxygen and they gave us the wrong room we originally booked and the manager basically said "I don't care" yup! This is after driving for hours!!! He didn't even care if we have children or if my mom has her oxygen stuff! PLEASE DONT STAY HERE!!!!. 4:13am- just called front desk to ask for rollaways and she was extremely rude! And saying I was cursing and stuff when I don't even curse and I wasn't even yelling! All I said was they need to show better customer service and should learn how to treat people well especially after they messed up our reservation then she hang up!!! Too  bad we have to wait longer to check-in to another hotel!!!! THEY DIDNT EVEN CARE IT'S CHRISTMAS !!!!!!
The non-smoking room smells like a smoking room. You need to purchase Tooth brush and tooth paste at the gift shop.
A few things I loved about my stay here was the way it was located perfectly next to everything amazing in Las Vegas :)!! The hotel was also joined with hotel "Paris" which I always went to for my breakfast buffet. The atmosphere is great and theres a really good thai restaurant. The rooms are clean but just average and the decor is a bit boring. Just be careful with your belongings as some of my family had jewelery stolen from a maid! The management was very helpful but. The fastfood restaurants down by the pool have a huge selection. Theres a hairdressers, beauty salon and a great clothes shop for young babies and kids. The pool is big and the cocktails are great. I would definatley return again :)
