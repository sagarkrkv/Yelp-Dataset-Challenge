While in Vegas last week, my husband and I stumbled upon this cool spot. I wanted to see the "old" part of the strip. We were walking down the strip, starving, and happened to see it. My husband pulled it up on his phone, and saw the excellent reviews, so we went in. It was busy, and there was a wait, so we went into the fireside lounge. What a cool, hip, old-school Vegas setting! The Bloody Mary was the best I have ever tasted (I normally don't like them, but this one was awesome). The reviews that my husband  saw suggested ordering one, so we did (and two more). The food was amazing with enormous portions, so beware. For Vegas, the prices are reasonable, and we had excellent service in both the bar and restaurant. We will make it a point to go back to this place on our future trips to Vegas. The only negative is that it is down next to the Riviera, and walking in that area is a little shady. I wouldn't walk down there late at night; take a cab.
This place is interesting. Huge portions and the whole vibe is old Vegas feeling but in a great way. My omelet contained 10 eggs. It was very filling and loaded with cheese and fillings. It came with a side of fried potatoes and bread. I selected the blueberry muffin. We also had some of the best bottomless coffee on the strip. It would be a place I would definitely recommend and come back to. Wonderful authentic Las Vegas diner.
Went here with my date late night after the Stevie Wonder concert. Unfortunately we were unable to experience the Fireside Lounge but The Peppermill Restaurant was Great! They had very good food I'm a breakfast type guy so I ordered 3 pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage; it was a menu item but I forgot what it was called. My date ordered the 3 cheeseburger sliders and onion rings. Like I said the food was very good and they have large portions so make sure when you come you have a pretty empty stomach, we didn't even finish our food but they made for great leftovers.
What a gem on the strip!  After a failed trip to Tacos El Gordo for a quick bite before we left town Monday morning, we decided to hop over here.. . The decor is...funktastic, like a 1970's disco party.  You were definitely transported back in time, like the menu says, to how Vegas used to be.  . . Even on a Monday morning, business was good.  Thankfully, there was no wait for us because we were both famished and in a hurry to get on the road.. . Puzzle:  A sexy cocktail server takes your alcoholic beverage order while a more normal one (still cute, just showing less cleavage) takes your food and juice orders.  Everything ends up on the same bill anyway.  Just thought that was kind of odd. . . Food:  Pretty yummy.  Breakfast portions were generous except hubby's NY Steak and eggs was normal sized.  I got corned beef hash and eggs and realized I didn't get any hash browns with it.  However, I noodled it over and reasoned that the corned beef already had potatoes in it.  Just so used to other places giving you a side of hash browns, this sort of made sense.  . My dish was pretty greasy...rather than a patty of corned beef hash, it was bowl of mushy stuff, sitting in a lot of butter.  I did enjoy my breakfast but it got pretty salty and I tried to avoid the parts sitting butter.  Hubby said his steak was ok and eggs were well cooked.. . Cool stuff:  Sugar dispenser contained multi-colored crystals which resembled those tube-like beads you used to make jewelry.  I could resist taking a teaspoonful and eating it like a kid.  Downside:  The dispenser had some crusty old gunk on it so it was a little gross to handle.. . Service was very friendly and on-par.  Definitely a place to consider if you're nearby and want some good breakfast grub.
They are feeding dinosaurs here. The portions are larger than humongous. Seriously. And it's still tasty. I had an omelet and pancake for breakfast and was not hungry again until dinnertime. My omelet had fresh ingredients and my husband enjoyed his omelet as well. Super service for us.  For the price and the amount it cannot be beat. Real diner food. Husband also had nachos and wings one night and raves about those as well.
I have been coming here for years. And this place has made me very upset. Apparently this place will cater to pimps, and hoes. And drunks waking in at 3am. But when you, a normal human being trip and fall one time this place won't want you back. Better not waste your time if your sober and fall. This is a terrible place to come. Don't spend your money. Find a better coffee shop to go to. This place has lost my business forever. And if they treat everyone like crap, I hope you all won't go back.
This place is U-MAZ-ING!   Be prepared to wait but it's ok! Go have a bloody Mary at the lounge area while you wait! BEST Bloody Mary ever and it's the perfect amount of spice. . . I enjoyed the eggs Benedict with hashbrowns. It's a pretty good size servicing and the coffee is really good. Always topped off don't have to ask. Service is really good and the place it fun and clean. . . Only thing is they should update the restrooms. They look dated and musty.
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. When you come to Vegas do it right,and come to the Peppermill for breakfast. Customer service is Great! Foodwas fresh and awesome.We had the fresh fruit platter and eggs/hash-browns(shared).This confirmed portions are large. Peppermill allows the 80's continue to live on.....WoW
This place is great! Stopped here for brunch, and although there was a 35 minute wait, the experience was worth it. Great food, great service and good prices :) I would recommend this place for anyone visiting sin city!! #nomnomnom
They have such a huge food selection and breakfast is served 24/7! The portions are gigantic.friendly staff and really cool ambiance with all the neon lights. We have come here for breakfasts, brunches, lunches, dinners and even late nights after going out. Consistently good food. My favorite place to come when we visit Vegas. Plan ahead though because sometimes the wait is very long.
I've been going to Vegas a couple times a year since I was a kid... I looked at this place as we passed by and never thought about going in... then one day I decided to give it a shot.... what was I waiting for! This place is great! It is officially one of my stops every trip now! Haven't been disappointed yet. Foods amazing and portions are plentiful! I want to go to Vegas right now just for an omelet!!! Plus I won on a slot machine in the lobby last trip that paid for the whole meal!
Here for breakfast this place is pretty cool and the coffee is hot and wait is not bad at all because this place is packed we got our table in about five minutes. And they have slot machines at the front door.
Enjoyable experience..  This is the place to go for a classic old Vegas feel.  The food was great and the portions were enormous... Open 24/7, so ya can't go wrong
Service was very good & the food was great, we had the nachos with beef - all of the ingredients were fresh made , the refried beans were awesome  . We both had the steak & cheese subs with fries , again very good. Unless you are very big eaters you could easily order one meal - split it  & be full our bill was less than $40 with enough left over to feed at-least or 2 or 3 more people. Not to mention the place is set up real cool - if you haven't been you need to & you will come back , I know we will.
Top notch with a hint of old Vegas love the vibe from the second you walk in.  Fellas need a late night stop and fill look no further, awesome bar
Back again for the 2nd night in a row. & no let downs again - staff was awesome food was huge & good . This time I had chicken fried steak meal. & she got breakfast , & we had the half order of nachos which is enough for 4 - not the cheapest grub on the strip  but  quality & portion make it well worth it . Try it & you will see why it is still standing after so many others have fallen away.
...who knew it was so easy to be transported to 1974....on many levels it is a WTF experience...another not to be missed Vegas experience...hang out at the romantic Fireside Lounge...nothing else really matters...
This should be a required stop for breakfast on any Vegas trip. Seriously! If you haven't been, you need to go.. . This place is always busy, so be prepared for the wait. . . The wait is well worth it though. . . The food has been great every single time we have been here. Large portions that are almost sharable. . . Service is always great and I love that they are all dressed up fancy. . . The pricing is average and you totally get your monies worth.. . They make an excellent bloody mary as well.. . Go get your breakfast on!
Awesum mushroom burger!!  We ate here 4 times in 12 days. Very comfortable inside!! Nachos are enormous!
This place is pretty cool! It is quite busy but I do think it's worth the 20-30 minute wait to get seated. I highly recommend sharing a plate, because the portions are just massive. 2-3 people could easily eat to complete fullness just from one of their omlettes. Staff is friendly but because they are so busy they are a bit neglectful, however that is understandable. Food is good!
A very cozy place with great vibe. The staff were friendly and the food was great. I usually complain about portions but here I had left-overs! It might sound normal but that's very unusual for me! Food was great. Entrees came with a side of soup or salad and the meals came with a plate of garlic bread which we really liked.
Long wait, pretty pricy.... large portions of food but not very good. Save some cash if u want breakfast and go to IHOP
This place is waaaaay over hyped! I found this place on yelp and decided to go on Christmas Day! We walked in and as expected, there was a long line to be seated. That was ok since it's Christmas and there are a lot of big parties waiting to sit. But we finally get seated and the booth was nice and roomy and the decorations looked like something out of pulp fiction when they go to the diner with the cars, very colorful with trees inside the dining room and even colorful sugar on the table. We had 4 (yes I'm not exaggerating) ask for our drink order from the bar! I get it that's a money maker. We order a bloody marry and it arrives 5 min later. It was ok. Nothing to write home about. . Our waiter comes over and introduces himself (really laying it on thick for the tip no less) and again I get it! It Christmas and he's working so he might as well make money. But then he tells us to look over the menu and that hell be back in a few min! 20 min later after I've asked several of the bus boys to call over our waiter, he shows up and takes our order. I guess he could tell from my facial expression that I was pissed so he kept a smile on his face and took our orders fast. We order the appetizer sampler (fried shrimp, fried chicken fingers, onion rings, bruschetta, and cheese sticks), buffalo chicken wrap and nachos. The sampler was decent, the wrap too but the nachos were awful! I huge plate full of chips, a little bit of semi melted cheese, raw onions and a lot of black olives emptied from a can right on too!!!! It was just awful (baja fresh and la salsa have way better nachos). . It came with a side (small in comparison to how much chips was in the plate ) of sour cream and old (brown guacamole) for almost $16!!!!! . So we ate a little bit of this and that Just kind of picking on the plates and finally decided it was time to go! We asked for a few boxes and the check! The waiter comes back and is completely confused as to the drink we ordered. He kept asking us if we ordered a sunrise something and I kept telling him NO! That all we ordered was the bloody marry and it was still on the table. He tried to help us pack the nachos and just broke the chips by pushing it down to try to make it fit. On our check we were charged for the sunrise something and I wanted to flag the guy down and tell him but my husband was so over it that we just paid and left!. . All in all, go here only if you're hungover, have the munchies or don't care AT ALL what you put into your body! I can't for the life of me figure out all these good reviews. I'm usually very easy going but that was one of the most awful experiences in a restaurant /diner that I've had with both food and service. You're only paying for the decorations/ ambiance! . Don't waste your time and money here. There was way better local places to try! The 2 stars are for the ambiance and cute colored sugar on the table! That's it!!! Good luck!
I know everyone raves about this place and maybe it was just our server but I did not have a good experience here. We waited about 7 minutes for our server to show up. No greeting and no smile. We ordered drinks and she brought then in a couple minutes - that was fine - but my wife wasn't ready to order. "Just give me another minute," says my wife. Well the sever took about 6 minutes to get back with us. Meanwhile the server for the neighboring tables had been back and forth four times.  Anyway we ordered and it was busy so we were patient. But meanwhile while waiting for our food another couple were seated near us being served by the other waitress. They got drinks, ordered and got their food 10 minutes before we did.
Very busy but they do take reservations. Food came out in a decent amount of time and was very yummy. I'm a big breakfast fan so I had breakfast for dinner.  The rest of the table had burgers and it was good reviews all around. The one cocktail my brother ordered was $14 which is very overpriced but not a reason to skip out on this place.
This place has been awhile for a long time and both the restaurant and lounge are hot spots, but for different reasons. Both are old school, classic Vegas with the restaurant featuring classic American favorites like burgers, breakfasts, sandwiches, steaks, etc. I've been here many times and most everything I've had is good. The prices are high ($20 for a Chicken Fried Steak) but portions are huge so I guess it's warranted. I'm a healthy eater but I'd easily take half a portion for half the price sometimes. This place is super popular so if you're trying to go at a peak time, either try to find a place at the counter or prepare for a pretty long wait.. . The lounge is also old school with the fire pit being the main attraction. It's dark, leathery, and open 24/7. Definitely a place you want to take a date if you want an a romantic after hours dinner. Like the restaurant, prices are higher than they should be but you just can't beat the ambiance.
First let me say this restaruant is all over the place. When you walk in and take a look at the decor you are immediately taken back to the 70s. . . There's a separate bar area from the restaurant inside known as fireside which is right by the restroom area.  Inside you will find a fire pit within a jacuzzi, along with neon lights,  trees, and velvet chairs and couches.. . Inside the main restaurant the theme continues from the waitresses outfits to the specialty drinks that are on the back of the menu. My mom was taken back by the drinks since she hasn't seen them being poured (made) in a while. Kudos for that!!. . As for the food everything we had was really good. We enjoyed the French Toast combo and Munchs breakfast. The portions were large and filling and the price couldn't be beat.. . While at the restaurant we ran into a couple who stated they were told about this place by their limo driver. The couple had only heard of IHOP, and the driver told them that, "IHOP was like kissing your mother and this place was like kissing your lover." I thought that was a funny analogy.
Big portions 10 egg omelets great prices long wait times arrive early. Would come back again!! Lots of options good kids menu.
