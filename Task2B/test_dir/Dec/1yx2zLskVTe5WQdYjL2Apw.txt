Yummers!!!. . I loved this restaurant.  We only had to wait 15 minutes on a Sunday morning and were kindly seated.  The restaurant is a good size and was cutely decorated.  It's a really good family and brunch place.  . . I ordered an omelette and enjoyed it a lot.  The portions are generous here.  The best part of this place is the service.  Our server (older Hispanic lady) was very funny and recommended different things for us.  I was being picky and she let me.  Thanks, ma'am!  The roasted potatoes here are really good.  I like hashed browns a lot and never really like home potatoes, but for once the potatoes trumped the hashed browns.  They were crispy and lightly seasoned.. . I tried the chocolate chip pumpkin pancakes and the tasted absolutely AMAZING!  I couldn't stop eating them even though I was full.  I also had a bite of someone's French toast sandwich, and oh my gosh, did that taste like heaven in my mouth!!!!!  If you're ok with a heart attack on a plate, this is it.  It was a huge portion of eggs, bacon, ham, and sausage goodness.  This was probably the tastiest thing on the menu, and I had only a bite.  Definitely something you can share if you're not too hungry.  Great service and good value for the dollar!. . Egg & I, I will be back!
I ate breakfast at the Egg & I on Sahara in Las Vegas, NV on 11/23/2014.  I was my 1st time there.  There were seven of us.  Everyone had something different.  I had their western omelette.  This place is connected with Egg Works and has the same menu.  Plus, I took photos.
Half order of Mashed Potatoes Omelet and an ice tea is how everyone should start their day!
Food here is excellent and service was ok considering we call and made our reservation.
Just average. Ordered the biscuits and gravy two eggs over medium with bacon and potatoes. The gravy had no sausage in it as far as I could tell, the eggs were under cooked, sent them back just to get the same under cooked eggs, the only really good thing was the potatoes.. Only got two cups of coffee, the server took the coffee pot away when the eggs were sent back. I guess that was my punishment for sending the eggs back.. Most likely will not return.
Absolutely amazing! The place was busy but we were still seated right away. We didn't have to wait at all for our food. Our banana nut muffins were so fresh they were still warm. We all got different things off of the menu and liked everything we had. Lisa was our waitress- she was very friendly, and very efficient.  We will definitely stop here again when we visit vegas!
I come here every time I visit vegas, which is about 8 to 10 times a year.. . I love this place,  their food is amazing!. . Don't be fooled by the big crowd outside waiting, they are so quick with serving that people are constantly getting seated.. . Servers like Dariesia make the restaurant experience fun and enjoyable! Servers should learn from her and Crack a joke once in a while. Haha.. . Highly recommended! Just don't come at the same time as me, might have to fight for the banana nut muffins... :)
The cashier/hostess Caresia must've been having a bad day. She was not friendly or personable at all. The food wasn't good. I ordered the strawberry cream cheese french toast. There was so much cream cheese, whip cream and artificial strawberry sauce that you couldn't enjoy the French toast at all. It was soggy. No need for syrup at all because it was so sweet. Definitely won't be going back to this place. The only thing good was the hospitality by the waitresses that's why I give it 2 stars.
I went here based on the yelp reviews.  Lots of locals mixed with tourists.  Seated right away and even on a Monday morning was jammed packed with people. I had the Cheese, Spinach & Egg omelet. Even though it is not on the menu, you can design your own omelette.  so I designed one just for me, I asked for fruit rather than potatoes no extra charge to change the sides the fruit was amazing -big pieces of  pineapple, orange, grapefruit, watermelon, canteloupe and honeydew.  Everything was yummy including the home made Banana Nut Muffins and we took a few to go.  Good place for breakfast, nice menu selection and Carole Ann was a great waitress.  The total cost including two breakfasts, 3 muffins to go, 2 hot teas, = $31.00 with tax & tip.  Very good breakfast & service.
The banana nut muffin was delish, a must have! Service was wonderful thanks to Karla for making our experience wonderful!
VERY MISLED by Yelpers here. No accounting for taste..... . We had the tuna melt, the Sundance Special, and the flavored coffee (partner's idea). The Sundance Special, a veggie omelet with thought behind it, was actually pretty yummy (artichoke, feta, spinach...great flavors), but the potatoes that come with were pretty yucky. Just cubed potatoes that are overly seasoned and taste previously frozen, not that fresh.. . The tuna melt was the WORST I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE. SOOOOO BAD! The "cheese" looked like a non-melting version of Velveeta. I'm not sure it was real. I had to scrape it off; it was disgusting. Also the tuna salad part was the worst tuna salad ever. It was a mushy, wet, flavorless glob of mayonnaise mess. The Parmesan bread it comes on is super-salty. The matchstick fries it comes with don't taste that fresh and are overly spiced.. . I picked the sandwich to pieces, and most pieces remained on my plate. I ate my partner's Sundance Special, because Vegas portion sizes allow for that. The server didn't even bother to ask how our food was, just slapped the check down and didn't comment that I had barely touched my plate.. . The flavored coffee (hazelnut) is really gross. Bad idea to order it, but it tastes like the bad idea it is--overly sweet with its sweetness covering up that burnt taste that most diner coffee has.. . This is the kind of place that automatically brings straws with water and gives you styrofoam for your leftovers.
First time eating there I ate the prime rib poached eggs ssndwich.  Very different style of presentation.   Food was cold when receiving it.  Potatoes were nothing special.  But what was the kicker for me was their salsa.  Thank goodness I didn't dump it on food without tasting it first.  Tasted like vinegar.  They had table tent advertising to vote for best breakfast of Las Vegas.  No I couldn't do that at all.  Service was excellent.   That's only reason I'm giving 3 stars.
We did not want to have breakfast at the hotel and we decided to give this place a try. It is a great place . Service is very nice and friendly.we had Darlesia as our server , I give her 5 stars. I highly recommend The eggs & I.
Delicious!!  The banana nut muffin is to die for.  The breakfast is delicious here.  The potatoes are flavorful very seasoned. Portions are pretty big - very filling.  Food comes out pretty fast.
Amazing breakfast with a break away from all the Vegas pricing at other restaurants. Our server was Lisa who was outstanding, always making sure we were well taken care of. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an awesome breakfast for a decent price.
So completely awesome. Love the table service interactives. Makes things so easy. The food was delicious with great portion sizes.
Taste: 3. Creativity/Authenticity: 3. Atmosphere: 3. Service: 5. Bang for your buck: 3.5. . Lets start with when your standing in line (with no one in it) and 2 girls walk up they will ignore you and seat them first so off to a bad start. The waitress is what made me change my mind very friendly and attentive (perfect service). Now to the food, not sure why this place got such high ratings but i wasn't that impressed. They seem to be all about the omelets so the other stuff might not be so good; to start i got a side of biscuits and gravy... more like stale dry biscuits with not enough gravy so again not off to a good start. So the main dish yeah i should have got an omelet but with so many choices i couldn't decide so i got the cabo breakfast burrito... bad choice the burrito was soggy smothered in sauce it was just very un appetizing and the side of house potatoes covered in that texas seasoning was one cold and dry so i don't know if i just got the last of that batch but my experience here was nothing short of just meh nothing that dennys couldn't have filled. Overall the service here at least from my waitress was what gave this a 3 star but the food was not what i expected; especially from the high reviews this place got. NEXT
I would give a hundred stars if I could. Alexa was beyond amazing, I'm shocked she's not serving at the nicest most high end restaurant in Vegas. She has a smile that lights up an entire room and a personality to match it. We were being somewhat complicated with our order and everything came out perfect and tasted great. Will absolutely be back!!
Lisa was fantastic! Everything about this place is fantastic. . . Service. . Attentive quick. Within fave minutes drink was served and with in ten food is served. Just right amount of check ups and right after we finished the bill and Togo box is served. . . Good. . Ordered the works omelette and beef hash, with muffins and potatoes as sides. The banana muffins are simply amazing. I'm not a big fan of baked goods but the muffins are something else. . . The potatoes tastes like squared fries and delightfully crispy. The actual omelette and the beef hash are tasty with just the right amount of seasoning. . . Did I mention bottomless coffee? Omg this place have everything! This will be my new favorite spot when I come to Vegas
I have to say, this was a outstanding breakfast, right down to the coffee. I had pork chops and eggs that was so tender. We also had the corned beef hash which was outstanding. Wherever you are at in Vegas, this is worth the drive. It is now a must have when I come into town. I was outstanding
This place was horrible! Did we come on a bad day or what? . . The 4 of us decided to stop in here for breakfast before making the 10 hour trip back home. We decided to give this place a try as it had really good reviews. . . We got in and got seated pretty fast, there was quite a few people. I ordered a vanilla latte coffee whatever and it was way too sweet. I feel like I might have gotten diabetes from that coffee. . . Aftwr looking at the newspaper menu for a few minutes I decided on the chicken fried steak skillet since I am a big fan of all things chicken friend. The 3 others got the Mexican omelet, I believe that is what it was called. . . The food came out pretty quick, first glance at my chicken fried skillet made me queesy but I was hungry and I thought it can't be that bad. The country gravy was gelatinous. It was weird. Like a slime blob of gravy exploded all over my food. Whatever. Give it a try. . . It didn't taste that bad but it didn't taste good. It was very salty and I just couldn't get over the slime gravy so I stopped eating. Everyone else with their Mexican omelet had tears streaming down their face. Apparently the omelet was too spicy to even enjoy. My partner is Mexican and loves her spicy foods. She is obsessed with all things spicy, tears will be streaking down her face and she will still say it isn't spicy enough, but even she struggled with the omelet. Maybe not that it was too spicy but that it tasted like crap spicy. . . Anyways, about 10 minutes after trying to eat my slime it hit me like a brick, I made a beeline to the bathroom and was in there for about 10 minutes only to return 5 more times. . . As you can imagine the 10 hour car ride home was horrible. Never again.
Excellent breakfast, excellent service. Veronica was amazing! We come here all the time and are never disappointed.
The food is always fresh and the service is great. Huge portions of quality food for a low price. Karla was our server this time and she did great.
AmaZing best american brunch/ breakfast ever! Prices are reasonable. thank you Karla she helped us to find out the best ones in the menu! Easy to park! 4 miles to stribe dont be lazy is worthed
We ordered Works Skillet, Traditional Benny, and the strawberry stuffed toast. All orders come with a large portion, and the most important is: they are very very yummy! Best Breakfast in Vegas!
Excellent place for breakfast. We found it by chance. Huge portions and the ranch potatoes were awesome. Service was perfect and the wait time was 10-15 minutes. I would highly recommend.
