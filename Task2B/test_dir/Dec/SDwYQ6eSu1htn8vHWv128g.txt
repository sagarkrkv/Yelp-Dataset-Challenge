Love love this place. Sooooo gooooooood!  Recommend highly,
I enjoyed this place! My husband and I met another couple here for dinner. We got 4 types of bruschetta- the seasonal, goat cheese with peppers, one with prosciutto, figs, and marscapone, and Brie apple and fig. All 4 were amazing!! I ordered a salad and the broccoli cheese soup. They were both good, but overshadowed by the amazing bruschetta. They had a very nice wine and beer selection. We saw on the patio under a heater and that made for a very nice ambiance. It took me a bit to catch on that we didn't have just one server, but that all the servers help all the tables. All in all- I would definitely go back!
Great place, great food...but lot's of bread on the menu which is the only discrepancy. Very charming.
I came here to meet a friend who I hadn't seen in ages. Some how the waitress assumed we just needed to catch up and decided, on her own, to not ask us for drinks or food for a solid 40 minutes. My friend, who works in the food industry, strongly insisted we should walk out. . . I insisted we stay because I'd been itching for some bruschetta. Finally, when this waitress noticed us we ordered. Food was decent, wine was great, Sub-par service. Love the neighborhood and the atmosphere. Might be back, but I have no strong desire to.
My husband and I went to Postino for a dinner date during a recent weekend trip to Phoenix. It wasn't quite what we expected--we'd assumed it was the kind of Italian place where you could get a glass of wine and a plate of pasta--but we had a great time.. . Our reservation was for eight o'clock on a Saturday night, and the place was busy but comfortable. It felt intimate and not too crowded. The lighting was low, and the space was warm and charming. A great go-to date spot. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were well taken care of.. . Postino is more a wine bar than a full sit-down restaurant, with reasonably priced bottles and a menu that consists of large format antipasti and paninis. We ordered a bottle of Canto Sur, a red blend of mostly cabernet and carmenere. You can get wines by the glass here, but the bottle prices are only three times the glass prices, putting most of the bottles in the high twenties/low thirties range. We were happy with the wine. We also ordered a few antipasti and tried to order paninis for our dinner when our waitress stopped us--she said what we thought were antipastis would fill us up plenty, and she was absolutely right.. . Granted, we were planning to order a pretty big spread of appetizers. We shared the butcher's block, the pub board, and a selection of four bruschetta. Did not realize that each of these boards would be gigantic. Everything was delicious. The butcher's block came with plenty of meat--prosciutto, coppa, salami, and peppered salami--along with goat cheese and white bean hummus. There was crostini, of course, and a huge assortment of great accompaniments--olives, dried cranberries, almonds, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, smoked yellow tomatoes, and three kinds of pickle.The pub board brought another huge spread, this one of MJ's soft pretzels, Scrheiner's chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar, and giant Spanish corn nuts. It was fun to mix and match everything on these boards, and it was all fantastic. The bruschetta seems to be the main draw of Postino, but I didn't understand why until our selection arrived. We opted to order four of them for $14, and were expecting bruschetta sized like bruschetta. These were more like full-on flatbreads, with the four bruschetta adding up to about a pizza in volume. We had the tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, the salami with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato. Not a dud in the bunch--loved all the meat, and the tangy cheese with the sweet tomato jam was perfect on its own.. . We took great pleasure in our feast of antipasti and wine. We ate with our hands and enjoyed the variety. I'd love to go back to Postino next time I'm in Phoenix. I'd be a regular if I lived in town.
What a great place with awesome service! Good was fresh, bruschetta was amazing! Perfect place!!!
