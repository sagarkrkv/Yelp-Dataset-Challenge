The Luxor always seemed to be a cool place to stay, so when my family booked a room there to stay, i was quite excited. . . We stayed from 12/26-12/29 and I did not like the hotel at all. . . There is no Wifi in the hotel, which I was totally bummed about because I don't have unlimited data; also the bathroom shower smelled like bleach or cleaning product the whole time- that's not an amusing smell. . . We also upgraded to the tower and in the description it said "stunning views," well we did not have that. We were on the 4th floor and directly out of our window, we were looking at some type of concrete structure (parking structure, maybe?) I couldn't tell what it was. We went down to the front desk and asked to change rooms and they said it was not possible because of all the people staying there, blah blah blah, and we could try the next day. . . The only somewhat nice thing about this hotel was the cub, L A X, they played good music but the dance floor was a bit oddly shaped. . . Another nice part was that it had the tram to Excalibur and Mandalay bay (I would suggest staying there- they have better food courts and are just better hotels in general. I've stayed at both)
REVIEW FOR PARKING. . If you are a MLife gold member be sure to get a VIP parking pass. You can park  very close to the entrance in the garage. Short walk into the casino. It was so worth it when I went to watch the Jabbawockeez.. . Now why can't other hotels start implementing this idea. So cool!
Spacious neat room.....No mini fridge!!! Plus, it's a bit of a hike to get to the room from the parking garage.
Good price and location but very smoky. Even in our non smoking room it smells incredibly like cigarettes
Disgusting, Gross, Filthy and Falling Apart..  Advertised as Recently Remodeled..  Bwaawaahhhh!!  Who are they kidding....  The shower was literally rusted and falling apart, plus it had Black Mold all around it.  The Vent was filthy, the air conditioner sounded like a freight train running all night and the cloth covered chairs were beyond disgusting and I would not even sit on them.
Checked it out for a day. The Titanic artifacts museum was outstanding! Whoever put this all together really did an outstanding job. Truly excellent and well thought out. After spending about three hours inside the museum and reading everything displayed, as well as spending time in the realistic Titanic stage sets like the Grand Staircase and the Promenade Deck, I felt like I had really been aboard! I loved the Titanic museum and would go back a second time to take some friends. . However, the main floor, the casino, and the overall facilities themselves seem to be as dated and worn out as the 100-year-old Titanic museum artifacts!
Stayed here twice once with a free upgrade to a pyramid suite. The top, as noted by someone else there are no curtains but who can look in? It was most definitely old and needs a renovation, but for $40 per night not bad value. The most annoying thing is no WiFi, they are not alone with this, all the older ones I have stayed at are the same and it seems a rip off considering the resort fee. . Have also stayed in the towers and they are a lot better, if you can upgrade to them I would recommend it. Better rooms and fixtures and feels newer and cleaner. I have stayed at other casinos on the strip that charge more for less.
The worst hotel experience ever. First, I have to commend the hotel staff, because they were friendly, professional, and helpful. BUT...they can't make up for all the problems this hotel has. My first night there, I was happy with my room in the pyramid. I've stayed here before, so it was as I remembered it. Other than not enough blankets on the bed and no bathtub just a shower, it was a fine room for the money. It was clean and nicely decorated.  Except for the fact that at one-thirty in the morning, I started hearing water dripping in the bathroom, then splashing. It gets louder and louder, until I get up and go  look, and water is pouring through the light fixture in the ceiling. All over the vanity and onto the floor. Pouring. I call the front desk and they have someone there in five minutes. I have to pack up all of my stuff,  and they move me to another room. They tell me I'm lucky, because the room is an upgrade, with a large soaking tub. But the room is not an upgrade, it's a dump. It feels as if they put me in some out of the way, rarely used closet. There is an old fridge in the corner, that has been rolled in on wheels, with bath towels folded up under it to keep it from leaking on the floor. The light over the tub doesn't work, so you have to sit in the dark, since it's in a corner. There are stains on the toilet seat, and stains on the carpet. I was excited for the tub, until I realized the cold water won't turn on. I'm sick of moving, so I try to handle it myself, by pouring ice cubes in the tub. AND then when I walk into the weirdly shaped little dining area, my feet get wet, and I notice the ROOF IS LEAKING from the rain we are having. The carpet is soaked. I really, really, don't want to ask for another room, because I don't want to pack up and move again. But I figure I better at least tell someone. I call the manger- who has left me a voicemail asking how I like the new room- and let her know about the roof leak. Since I don't want to move she offers to comp a night. I ask if she'll comp room service instead, and she does, happily. SO, all in all, I feel terrible for the staff that is trying to do damage control for a building that is not being cared for in any way shape or form. I got the impression they are trying to squeeze every last cent out of the hotel and are just biding their time until it's time to demo it for something new. Also, along the walkways back to the elevator, I noticed what looked like black mold along the corners of the ceilings. Roof is prolly leaking everywhere. Also, the elevators are visibly falling apart in places from the stress of the sideways- it's an inclinator really, not actually an elevator. MGM owns this place, and they should be ashamed of themselves.
First the good: it's a very beautiful hotel. And the fact that it's connected to two other very popular hotels is a great plus.  Plenty of shopping, casinos, clubs, bars/lounges and eateries without having to go outside was a great thing considering its supposed to rain my entire trip. . . Now the bad: that $22.40 resort fee. They boast about their low rates, but fail to mention that when you check in, you'll be paying an additional fee per night. These fees are supposed to pay for the wifi and long distance and local calls. 1) I only got wifi in the common areas. No wifi in my room. Barely any service in my room for that matter. 2) who doesn't have a cell phone these days??  . . I had to start the shower/bath water in my room 10 minutes prior to taking a shower/bath because that's how long it took the water to get hot. 10 minutes!  Ridiculous!  . . I've stayed in less "luxurious" hotels and there was a fridge and microwave in the room. The Luxor has neither. I understand that this a probably a way for them to ensure you spend more money (no microwave to reheat leftover so you don't take any back to your room. No fridge to keep beverages cold), but at the very least a fridge would be nice. . . Also, forget calling the front desk for assistance. You're met withan automated system. After selecting 5 different prompts to speak to an actual live body, I was on hold for 10. All just to inquire about late checkout. . . This is my 2nd stay at the Luxor. Only stayed here because this is where the rest of my party stayed. I doubt I will return on my next trip to Las Vegas.
I booked this hotel with my flight on Southwest for $79/night. I was really happy with my stay even if it took two days to get my extra pillows and towels and they moved me to the East Tower when I told them it was too smoky to be in the pyramid with no issues. If you are planning on doing the Rock and Roll Half, this is a great venue to stay at. The Startline is across the street and the finishline is only a mile and some away. I would stay here again. Parking is free.
The only reason why I'm giving this place one star is because they contracted, ego maniac, Chris Angel to do "magic" at the theater there. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIS SHOW!
The good:. Nice, clean hotel rooms in the West tower. Lots of slots that are somewhat friendly. 3 Starbucks inside. 3rd largest hotel in the US. . The bad:. Terrible food options (most people chose McDonald's in food court). At the end of the strip. Tons of bothersome MLife staff trying to get you to sign up for something or buy tickets to a show. 3rd largest hotel in the US - very, very big, so it takes a while to get to the room or outside. Practically last hotel on strip, so it takes a long time to get to the central strip area. Someone ordered room service and left their food cart outside their door. It was there all night long and into the morning until at least 11 am.. . The ugly:. Rude staff. I asked a staff member for directions to the elevator because I had luggage to transport. He pointed me to the escalator and said "just take the escalator." When I pointed out the obvious baggage he simply indicated "I take luggage up there all the time." When I looked at him with a blank, evil eye stare, he said while walking away "the elevator is all the way in the back of the hotel." Not only was he wrong, but he was rude.
We came here for one night. Room had mold in the shower. Let Emily at the front desk know, and she couldn't have been more help! She hooked us up with a spa suite on the top floor of the pyramid for our inconvenience. We enjoyed the room very much, and we were even given a late check out with no fee. . . I understand this isn't the best hotel on the Strip, but the staff really went out of their way for us. Only dinged one start because of the mold. Other than that, perfect! And the elevators are fun, too!
OMG!!! . That's what I said when I seen all the splendor of the pyramid shape hotel. But once inside, it was mediocre to say the least. Then I had to get on that rickety elevator that goes sideways, and it was all down hill from there. Water damaged walls, warped doors, snowy television. I felt I was in the motel 6. I was highly disappointed in the overall stay at the Luxor and I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay there if they want luxury.
Back when I was in my 20's, I took my BFF here for her bachelorette party.  That was probably the last time I step foot inside the Luxor, and it was during that hotel's hey day. Now, its in a remote part of the strip, where the foot traffic is practially non existent.  Technically its probably the best location if you want to get away from the hub bub of the Strip.. . Nomally we stay at the other end of the Strip, and never pass New York/ MGM.  Stephen has never been here, and he's a fan of Egyptian stuff, so after lunch I suggested we try this casino.  . . A lot has changed since my last visit.  Gone is the Nile, and no more 3D Virtual ride. The security guard I was chatting with said there's no more free stuff, and you pretty much pay for everything here.  Its not like the "old days" he agreed.. . Its still a nice looking casino.  Quiet though.  I would like to try their rooms again, but only if its free.
Met some friends in VEgas and stayed here for the first time.. . I guess arriving late in the evening I missed all of the coupon opportunities, so it sucked having to pay full price for my dinner on the first night.. . Nonetheless, I was skeptical at first about staying there, but had a good experience in the end.. . The Scottish Salmon was a good way to finish up my first night at Luxor.
In preparation for a Vegas list I am putting together for future reference, I am back tracking on this review from a few years ago when I saw U2 and spent a few days in Vegas. I actually stayed here on a family holiday years ago and my experience was great. I love themed hotels and at the time was very into the Egyptian thing. The elevators that travel horizontally instead of vertically is a huge trip for me. The rooms for what you pay for have really cheap and ugly set of soaps and shampoos, however, other than that, the room was nice and clean with fluffy pillows. Staff never complained at my requests and were always friendly. I wish that the elevator had a window 'cause it would enhance the ride experience. It is one of the cheapest on the strip, therefore, don't expect much in terms of fanciness or class but expect to have a good time none the less.
Ok hotel but resort fees are expensive and taxed. Still have to pay the fees even though pool was closed for the season, no wifi in rooms only a tagged wired cable for a laptop. Intermittent hot water in shower. Only good thing was location and fast elevators.
What a nice hotel. I mean it's beautiful with all of the African artwork and hieroglyphics all over the place. The outside lights up at night and the Pharaoh statue outside is breathtaking. . . The elevators are rickity and loud and scary. The best part was getting on them with a drunk person to watch them freak out..FUNNY!! Because The Luxor is the shape of a triangle when you go up  you kind of lean in and when you go down you tilt backwards..like a rollercoster... . Try and get a room that is facing all the action.. our room was stuck behind all of the raised decor so our view sucked but I could care less.... . I swear to God if one more MLife person had come up to me and asked if "I wanted to see a show".. or "how long I was staying" I would have socked them in the face. This one lady asked me and my mom twice in the same breath. I was like "ma'am you just saw us walk pass you!". . Nice, clean hotel rooms . Lots of slots . 2 Starbucks inside. 3rd largest hotel in the US
Extremely irritated with this stay! The rooms show their age, this place is definitely in need of renovations and staffing replacement... My bf and I got the deluxe queen room in the east tower. The beds were ok, lots of closet space, bathroom was large which I liked.. They gave us a paper notice last night saying they need to shut off the water from 3am-7am for water piping maintenance. Just like home.. Then the water was NEVER turned back on. At 11am, I still haven't gotten the chance to shower and the toilet was filled with piss we couldn't flush!! When I called, all they said was "sorry, we don't know why the water won't turn back on for the east tower and we don't know how long this will take.. we can move you to another room. " So fine, I said ok to the room transfer... But had to wait on hold for more than 20 minutes for another rep to ask me why I was calling and then finally say they'll move me. WTF?? Waited another 15 mins for a bellhop to come help us with moving the luggage (note I had to ask, they did not offer help). Second room was in the pyramid. The moment from entering this room, it was so stuffy like no air had been running for a while in this room. So I left the door propped open to air it out. The bathroom was smaller and even older looking. The shower had one tiny ledge to put your toiletries.. when I requested extra towels and pillows, they delivered extra towels twice and I had to remind them about the pillows.. seriously? Later around 430p a security guard came around and said we couldn't have the door opened. Well, excuse me, have me suffer then! So pissed off with this property, definitely not staying here ever again and definitely not recommending this hotel to anyone!! You get 1 star just because your sales reps on the casino floor got us last year to book this advance in order to get our stay for free. Never again, Luxor!!
Stayed here for 1 night because we found a good rate on Expedia and half of our group left earlier than the 3 of us did so we didn't stay at PH for the last night of our stay. The hotel is definitely an interesting one, kind of fascinating from the outside but not as spectacular on the inside. It's pretty aged and you definitely wouldn't use the word "fancy" to describe it. The elevators run diagonally upwards to each floor. The hotel layout I wasn't that fond of. Since the rooms are all on the sides of the pyramid the casino and lobby and everything else happening downstairs is a giant open area and if you're a light sleeper you won't survive here. All night all you hear is the entertainment, sounds from the casino, and the smell of smoke since the rooms aren't separated from the rest of the hotel like they are at Planet Hollywood.  PH is my regular we stay there every year since it's affordable, central to the strip, and quick and easy access to food. Luxor is a little out of the way and we didn't even try to get food around here. . I probably wouldn't stay here again, even if i found a cheap rate. The WiFi was non existent we couldn't even get a connection. And I think we paid for it too which was even more annoying.
So I was in town with my son and he wanted to see the pyramid.  I told him I decided not to go back but he really wanted to see it.. I waited 20 minutes in a line to find out valet was full.  A sign at the road would have been nice.  I decided to try self parking.  Spent another 25 minutes trying to park and left.. Bottom line, once again I was deceived.  Luxor seems to have a way of doing that.
The girl who checked us in was super sweet wish I remembered her name... Anyway nice place clean room nice decor. Did not give it a 5 due to bad filter system too much smoke in the air. Guess I'm used to Aria!
Beautiful buffett-Egyptian vibe-loving it! Food was good, mimosas great! Bread pudding delish... Great variety.. Omelette bar -check. Asian station and carving station were yummy. Fresh OJ for mimosas. $35 for all day access, can't be beat.
Just landed from my trip to Vegas, and would recommend going back. The rooms was clean, but did not have small luxuries like a fridge or dock to plug in my music. they were updating the gym and the WiFi whichlook like they will be great when completed. . . Thursday night was almost a ghost town as this was their slowest week. Foot traffic greatly picked up through the weekend. There aren't a ton of food options which was the only downside.. . sounds like a negative review. However, the overall experience was really good . Great price for the room. Would recommend.
There's many shows and exhibitions here so I would recommend families to stay here.  Food court open 24 /7 and little convenience store on lobby level next to check-in counter is convenient.  :) . . We stayed for one night in the lowest rate room and was satisfied with the view of Mandalay Bay and Delano' s glistening sign.  Again, another great M life hotel and I would definitely return to stay.
First trip to Vegas, and had no issues here! Will def be back!
We weren't guest at this hotel but spent the majority of our time here. . . We found this to be the best casino to gamble at. At least this is the only one I was able to actually win some money at. . . The cocktail waitress's are on top of it and our drinks were never to far from being empty before they came back around.... ( outfits are tacky as hell and they shouldn't be forced to wear that crap ) . . Had a lot of fun exhibits and shows we attended.
We stayed in the tower. Room had connecting door. Had to listen to a couple having sex all night. EVERY night. While that wasn't the hotel's fault, the connecting door situation is what made us able to hear it all, scream for scream. The heater/aircon unit was broken so we were very cold. We reported both issues and staff were quick to respond on the heater. Not so much on the sex.. .  The hotel isn't maintained to the best standards, either. It feels kind of like somewhere that has had it's day and it's getting a bit tired. I would have two MAJOR  complaints - the timeshare touts who attack every US resident who goes by with promise of reduced show tickets. Please get rid of these pests. It is really off-putting and is not necessary. The lack of coffee and tea facilities in the room. No coffee or tea making facilities at all. You are forced to go to one of the the two starbucks and queue for ages to get a coffee or tea. Even the worst motels have this to offer!!. Shower was amazingly powerful, I loved it. Housekeeping was also amazing. Room was spotless. Staff were always amazingly friendly.. We'd never stay here again though.
The check in line was long but we did get here on Christmas Eve and it went quick.  Nice room with a view of the Mandalay Bay and airport.  We will be stopping at the souvenir shops before we leave.
Extremely irritated with this stay! The rooms show their age, this place is definitely in need of renovations and staffing replacement... My bf and I got the deluxe queen room in the east tower. The beds were ok, lots of closet space, bathroom was large which I liked.. The daily resort fee has us paying for things we won't be using.. I am bummed that they only include wired internet, not wireless or Wi-Fi.. They gave us a paper notice last night saying they need to shut off the water from 3am-7am for water piping maintenance. Just like home.. Then the water was NEVER turned back on. At 11am, I still haven't gotten the chance to shower and the toilet was filled with piss we couldn't flush!!

Not very convenient, the west tower has no wifi in the room and no water heater or free coffee even no bottle water. And self parking place is kind of far from the main lobby, I might choose another hotel to live next time.
My boyfriend & I stayed at the Luxor from Nov 4-11th (7 nights) To start overall the experience was good. I would like to add this was our 1st time in Vegas. We choose Luxor for 2 reasons; Price & It was always my dream to stay in Luxor when I first saw it. Us being college kids on our own we did have a budget, and I will admit Luxor had a great price for Hotel/Air for 8 days. I looked at EVERY other Resorts for Hotel/Air and the price was crazy! But again they say you get what you pay for. My biggest complaint which really pissed me off to start out with was our first day: We just got off a 6 hour travel time from Tampa, FL & had been traveling since 5am so we were DEAD tired, the taxi driver dropped us off at the west tower (since we were staying in the towers were are way nicer/newer then the pyramid) When we got out, no1 was there to take our bags, which was abnormal. It was a headache us having 2 large bags & 2 smaller bags to roll into the hotel. When we finally made it to the front desk, the lady who was chatting away with another co-worker, looked clearly upset when I interrupted her conversation, (though she clearly saw me struggling with bags walking up to the desk) I kindly asked, "where is the bag drop off, and when can we check in?" She just looked at me, & pointed "over there, & check in time is 4pm." & when back to chatting. Now that had me superrrr mad. Trying to ignore it, we walked over to the bag drop off, & this blew my mind, all the bags from a bunch of customers were just sitting there out in plain site!! Some piled over & and on top of each other, &  then I saw one poor guy, trying to manage it all, & he looked like he had no idea what he was doing. I did NOT feel comfortable leaving our bags there so, we took all 4 bags & walked ALL the way around the resort (having no idea where we were going; first time) to find the entrance of the Luxor. We found the bag line, which had no roping or organization & stood in the long line. We trusted this though because people were getting tickets & bags were carefully taken into a room. The man taking the bag was very nice/talkative which was a breath of fresh air from what we just experienced. We ate at the food court waiting to check in (Arrived at 11am!) 2 pm we tired 2 check in early & we were able to get a room, the lady who checked  us in was fine, she didn't go above an beyond to make it great experience, it was just fine. I wrote in the special notes when booking the room we were celebrating a 21st birthday. (which they prob see often) But that was not acknowledged. Anyways, our room was on the 5th floor, & was a Pool/Mandalay Bay/Back of Pyramid  view. It was a pleasing view, very pretty to watch at night. I will note the guy that dropped of our bags to the room was SUPER nice, he was talking to us, asking how long we were staying etc. as well as giving us trips on what to do.  We did call front desk in hour into being in our room for more hangers, (hey I'm a girl I packed a lot!) My boyfriend asked for 15, & and they came within 30 mins, & bought 25. Which was nice as well. The room was very clean, no hairs/ junk on the floor... the carpet felt clean & didn't look old or stained. The bathroom was good as well, weird that a phone is right next to the toilet but it gave us a laugh! The bed was verrry comfy & we got lots of pillows (a big plus for me!) When I first walked in I automatically knew I would be happy spending a week in this room. The cleaning lady was ehh though, she was super friendly always say hello in the hall when we were leaving the room, but if we left the room after 5pm, no1 came in 2 clean it. (We are spoiled by Royal Caribbean cruise liners; they make your bed in the morning, and turn down your bed ever night!) So though-out the week we only had our room cleaned maybe 3 times. We never ran out of towels or anything, but it was little disappointing coming in at night to a still unmade bed. Walking though the casino was no problem either, we both look to be 17-18 & still no1 carded us. We drank his first drink at 21 in Centro Bar, the lady serving us was kind & said happy birthday. It was a nice location to be in the enter of the Casio to see all the action. We even used the pool 2x, so relaxing I took a 4 hour nap on a layout chair! We ate at, Pyramid Cafe, Back Stage Grill & More Buffet. All were fantastic!! Pyramid cafe (Breakfast) gave HUGE portions & was very fresh. Back Stage Grill, I no joke, ate at least 5 times. SO fresh, amazing ingredients! More Buffet is a GREAT value, 1 of the cheapest buffets on the strip & just as good food, ate there 2x. Overall, YES we would stay there again, the location is a little far at the end of the strip, but we took taxis/walked anyways. I would mainly stay there again because of the price was unbeatable if your on a budget, because come on, everything else is SO expensive in Vegas. We really never had any huge problems at Luxor, so they earned our business again in the future!
Stayed for Christmas Eve!. . My Significant Other and I stayed here for one night with a complementary room from the Facebook game: My Vegas. To our surprise we got a room in the pyramid! . . The Elevator up to the 23rd floor was a bit rickety but it is going diagonal ways... The view was exciting from both the room window and the hallway in front of the room.. . The Room:. +While I have stayed at nicer and more expensive places, what you pay for an average night here is what you get for being on the strip. . +Nothing appeared terrifying to us as the room service has been doing a good job of keeping things clean and tidy. . +The furniture obviously is no Encore or Bellagio so don't go hating on that. However it does appear worn a bit too much on some areas.. but hey, this room has and hundreds of people using it yearly. So to keep up with touching up some pieces here and there does take a lot of work.. + Our shower head did seem outdated from the 90's and the water pressure was no jet, but still felt quite nice.. . . Our only thing on why this is a 4 star is the overall feel of this room compared to a higher priced modern high end room on the strip. This room is well above a 3 star hotel and just under a 5 star due to needing some updates. . . I just can't write much more on the room as you need to be realistic to the price and the overall appeal of the hotel/rooms.
We came here for the Titanic Exhibition...while we were here, the beau and I decided we wanted Ramen on such a cold night. We Yelped it and found Monta and Sora however, we wanted to run it by the locals! So...we walked over to the Concierge and she (and I'm not kidding here), asked us "how do you spell Ramen?" I almost fell over as I'm looking around and seeing almost 80% Asians walking around! Worst part is, there was an ASIAN lady next to her that DID NOT JUMP IN to suggest anything. Worst part was, she was pulling up just the word "Ramen" not YELP but GOOGLE?! Oy, we would have been there all night waiting. Awful horrible employee at Concierge, learn to look things up on Yelp or better yet, here is a line you should learn "will you excuse me while I find someonewho might be able to point you in the right direction?!" Can't believe how ignorant she was. Yes, this is ignorant when more than half of your clientele are ASIANS!!! Just wow....Yelp saved our next night! Thank you Yelp!
The parking lot is way too hard to find and not convenient because you have to walk all across the casino and go somewhere across the street. The casino worker was not so kind when he knew we were just asking the directions.
Family and I stayed here at Luxor for three days starting from Christmas. I have to say, it's a very unique hotel, but of course there are pros and cons.. . Pros:. -Free soaps in bathrooms (well duh, who doesn't take advantage of those things?). -Connects to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, very convenient if you wanna go shopping or dining.. -Hotel rooms have a great view of Las Vegas outside.. -Has a tram if you don't want to walk to other hotels. Very speedy.. -Rooms have nice layout, with a TV.. -Box office with many shows to choose from, but as far as I know, they don't do discounts.. . Cons:. -Elevator is rickety, and especially if you have claustrophobia (fear of small and enclosed spaces), I wouldn't recommend going on the elevators. Although, the only other way to access upper floors was the emergency exit stairs.. -No coffee maker or microwave in the rooms. Not really convenient.. -Luxor trams only go to Excalibur. Wish there were more hotels to choose from.. -Food court needs more variety, and if you want more variety, you have to go to other resorts.. -Pool is closed during the winter. Couldn't there be heating?. . Well, I'm giving this 4 stars because the service is great and all but not 5 stars because the rooms seems a little bit...clogged.
Hotel staff was ...meh... View was ...meh... Food for the Christmas Buffet was ...meh... Noticing a theme yet. Everything was meh... . . Bathroom needed an update badly and the shower-head was ..yikes! Cool architecture and a neat design, but not well run at all. Rather disappointing. . . The wi-fi needs to be accessed through a particular browser, but the staff just says its spotty rather than explain it to people, however, since we are IT geeks we figured it out in 5 minutes. The fact they couldn't tell us outright was lame. . . We needed two nights and they were sold out for the next night, however, rather than telling us to check for a cancellation or adding us to a wait list, the front office person offered no options. Also the front office clerks left a screen turned around with another person's personal account information on it. I was close enough to read the whole screen and could have taken a photo if I was criminally minded (thankfully, I am not) Interestingly there was a floor manager right behind the counter. I directly asked him if they always left personal details for other too see and he spun the screen back around but did not offer an apology or anything to reassure me my credit details would any safer.. . Buffet was yucky - dry steak overcooked, mushy sushi rolls (cucumber roll only), some other fare not worth remembering.. . Only points for cool outside design (at night is great, day is meh too), neat interior in the pyramid and the rickety sideways angled elevator, which I found to be fun though I am sure many people would be afraid of the jerky motion.
Uhh don't stay here! Not an awful hotel but there are better options on the strip. The price was right and the room was decently clean. The staff has been friendly and responsive to any concerns but the location is not ideal. All the way at the end of the strip so getting anywhere takes forever! Check in was smooth and quick as well as getting our luggage up to the room. Our room was clean but the room temperature was uncomfortable. The air conditioner/heating unit was broken and our room was either freezing or a sauna...also the hotel reeks like marijuana 24/7. Our shower did not drain so showers had to be quick and you were stuck standing in your dirty shower water. The Wifi was also slow and cut out frequently. The room was very basic-no fridge or microwave. Overall the Luxor was okay but if it's not a holiday week there are definitely other comparably priced better hotels on the Strip!
