Nice enough place, but expensive hotels should at least have a little bit of noise containment, and this one doesn't.
We booked a room back in May. Free upgrade suite. Not honored because we didn't pay enough. The front desk people stated!! Last year we paid less & were upgraded to "The Hotel" V-suite.. Stayed 2 nights, left for a different hotel. We got a suite & saved lots of $$$.. We are Gold in Mlife.. Will not be staying at Mandalay Bay anymore. Looking to book a Feb 2015 trip.. We have stayed at MB 12+ times.. Plus all the money we spent at the Spa, shopping, gaming, dinning etc....
Been going to Mandalay Bay for 10 years. Great views of Vegas from the south. Go to the rooftop bar.
So Vegas altogether needs an upgrade, especially this hotel.  It's dirty and the house keeping needs some help.  On the first day we arrived to dirty sheets, dirty and dusty tables and stained towels.  Really makes me cringe when I think about it.  Have stayed here a handful of times and each time the quality has gone down.  This time it was really gross... Won't be staying here anymore.
Two people from MB contacted us today. The issues has been resolved. MB stated they were sorry for what had happened, MB showed real class. Case closed.. Mahalo  Stan
I came here with my family for Fourth of July about 4 years ago-ish. It wasn't necessarily a last minute trip, but we had a bit of difficulties trying to find a hotel that would allow dogs. lol. I don't remember what hotel we went to first, but over the phone they told us that they allowed dogs and when we got there, they told us no pets. It was quite frustrating. Not only had my car overheated but then this. So we kept driving around in about 115 degree heat in the middle of summer just getting really really tired of driving.. . Finally after about 3 other places we finally came here and they said they allowed small dogs. We were in luck. I think we actually got a pretty good deal too. The room was nice and it overlooked the strip and you could see a nearby airport across the way. I loved their large windows and just sat there on the floor looking out just admiring the lights and traffic etc. Yeah I'm weird like that. My dog sat with me which was kind of funny since I thought she might not like the height we were at. It was really packed with people down on the strip and there were a lot of hotel room parties going on. Walls are kind of thin or they just had the music way loud. Then again, they seemed to be talking in normal tones, but you could hear the majority of their conversations, which I particularly didn't like. . . The service was good and the rooms were cleanly compared to other places I've been to. This was my second trip to Vegas with my family in years. I didn't go into the casino area since I was underage at the time and spent most of the night with my camera outside taking pictures along the strip. That was actually pretty nice. There were a lot of the people handing out cards and the sidewalk was littered with them. . . Anyways, going off topic but the beds were very comfortable and I think we had room service cause everywhere we went was packed and we didn't want to deal with it. The food was good and service was prompt. I somehow missed the fireworks, but they probably had a decent view lol. I was just really happy that they allowed dogs. We didn't want to leave her alone at home while we were going to be away for a couple days. So they saved us from a disaster. :)
Ok.  So.  We played slots for 1.5 hrs.  And never even came close to having a waitress come and ask us for a drink.  Told later by bartenders that call in absenteeism is a habit here
First time I stayed here.  Comp'd room so I won't argue with the price.  Check-in was very quick.  Room is large.  Bed is comfortable.  Bathroom is huge.  A very nice place.  Not up to the Atria in terms of the comfort of the bed (or much less important, the modern electronics), but above many places on the Strip.  Some oddities: a lamp you turn on/off with a floor switch hidden behind a couch, or a large window into the bathroom next to the doorway (you don't want to open the room door while someone is bathing or changing -- or if you're sharing the room with not a naked-close friend, don't walk the hall while they're showering / bathing / changing).  Overall, I am comfortable here.  I'm a fan.
The hotel rooms are OK, but the price is great.  The Casino is not as great at pumping out smoke as other casinos.  If you stay in the room, bring some keurig pods because there's a machine in the room but they'll charge you $4 to use their pods.
We stayed here for my 21st birthday!!!. . Okay so let's start off from the beginning. We did a late check in (completely my fault I had a pre-birthday dinner with my family and we didn't end up getting there till 12am) originally we had a suite but because it was a comp room and there was an event at the hotel we got downgraded to a deluxe. . . So that was a big bummer to my boyfriend but I thought the deluxe was amazing and very spacious!!! The bed was favorite part because they had layers of blankets and a heavy but cool one (which is what I like) and the view was nice! Especially at night when the strip was lite up. There's hardly a downside to it. Oh wait I got one....the entrance to the shower has a door but it doesn't lock xD. But lucky there's another door that leads to the toilet and there's a button lock so yay!. . But I think some people at Mandalay don't know what vegas is about...apparently we were to "loud" we were just laughing and telling jokes. And one of our ignorant neighbors called the cops on us to "keep it down. It was only 10pm....white people? Jkjk . . But yeah I'll miss you Mandalay! COSMO your next!
Not really much to say. I don't gamble so the MB was mostly a place to stay and explore from.  The room and amenities were nice as were the grounds and stores were fun to explore. While overpriced (it is Las Vegas) the couple restuarants we ate at had good food. Been here before and would have no problem returning.
I love Mandalay Bay! . . When you walk through the doors you get a whiff of a fresh breezy tropical lotiony scent . Located on the strip one of the first hotels you come across. Delano is also a part of mandalay. There are a great selection of shops... Lush is here too! . . There is a tram or indoor walk route that leads you to Luxor Excalibur New York New York. . . Rooms have tubs which I like. They have a cardio exercise room downstairs that's open to guests but the gym is part of the spa and they charge a fee for daily access. . . There is a chapel, food court with subway etc, shark reef aquarium that's about $18-20 per person. . My favorite thing about MB is their pools. Wave pool, lazy river pool with waterfalls. The best during the summer.. . Light is also here too.
Ok lemme start by saying I'm very impressed with this hotel. The room is clean, spacious and most importantly comfortable!!!! I understand that for a lot of people the room really don't matter much but for me it does. I spend some downtime in the there and during that time I like to be comfortable. So for me the room does matter. My first impression of the room is that it was nice and I'm getting a good value for the money. . . Ok when I got here it was around 5:00 and I dreaded checking in. I had a huge headache and I was feeling pretty tired cause I've been nonstop all day even before getting a plane to Vegas. All I wanted was to get the room, take a shower and relax for a bit. Well to my amazement there was literally no line. Normally at this time check in is a zoo. I was checked in quickly and was in the room in no time. . . When I got to the room I put my stuff away and was excited because the bathtub looked very inviting and bubble bath sounded like the next best thing to heaven and believe me it was. That bath is perfect for just soaking in. They also have a TV in the bathroom so you can soak and watch which is what I did. Then I rinsed off in the shower and washed my hair and the shower was amazing too. Five stars for that. . . As far as convince of the room goes there's a lot of outlets which is good. One disappointment is I normally like to try room service at least once and the day I fly in is usually perfect cause I usually don't feel like running around looking for a restaurant. I find their room service menu and find the crappiest room service menu ever. There's no variety for dinner at all. A burger, a salmon dish, and some flatbreads where all they had. Most room service has lots of variety. This was a joke so I skipped that. That's my only gripe though and it's not enough to deduct a star. They made up for it in comfort.. . The bed was very comfortable. The blankets were soft and the pillows were comfy. I slept great every night! The only thing about this hotel is the walls are VERY thin. If someone is in the room next to you you will hear everything and they don;t have to be loud for you to hear it all too well. They can be a little annoying but you get used to it. In only had someone in the room next to mine the first and last night I was there so I was lucky. . . There is a little 24 hour convenience shop right by the elevators so it is great for any toiletries or snacks or really anything you might need. I love having one of those near by cause they come in handy. The casino is great as well. They have alot of slot machines to chose from and plenty of playing tables with varying limits. The cocktail waitresses make their rounds often so you do not find yourself waiting forever to get a drink. There are also plenty of restaurants and bars so you don't have to venture far to get to what you need. . . I did express checkout via text so nothing to it. they have alot of express checkout options. The WiFi and TV went out for a few hours one night and they refunded me my resort fee for the day for the inconvenience which I felt was a nice gesture. . . Overall I really really enjoyed my stay here. Everything from the room to the restaurants to the casino was all great. This is at the top of my list of favorites and I will definitely be back. Every place is going to have their pros and cons and to me the cons were minimal at this place. Not enough to effect their rating.
We got a great offer through MLife and decided to go right before Christmas. . . We loved:. - the bathroom (lots of counter space, a great shower, and a separate tub).. - room furniture (extra seating and tables). - housekeeping (they were amazing and cleaned so well each morning). - awesome food & beverage promo they offered. - easy/fast check in. - friendly employees. . We didn't care for:. - the location (we love walking everywhere and its just farther from things). - no one told us only one pool area would be open (it was freezing, but still). . Despite all the things we loved, the distance from everything else is just a deal breaker. There's a tram that can get you to NYNY but it only starts running at 9am and we are kind of early people. So we'd walk as far as Bellagio or Ceasars and back but never made it to the other end of the strip. And the walk from Mandalay to just get to NYNY is boring. Doing that multiple times during our trip got old.
Stayed here on Christmas. While the rooms are quite large & the bathroom has double sinks, the walls seem to be very thin. You can hear people talking in the hall while you're in bed. There was also a strange noise with the plumbing in the bathroom here and there. The wireless internet did not connect most of the time. They are charging you a "resort fee", so the internet should always be working. If you put on the do not disturb sign on the door, don't expect housekeeping to care. They came into the room to "clean up" while we were out & took the sign with them. Don't expect a view from your window unless you've paid for one. The hotel has some stores & restaurants. They had an ice water station in the lobby, but they were out of water at times. They should be making sure that they do not run out since they have so many guests at their hotel.
Just returned from a trip in Vegas.  Mandalay Bay had great reviews, and the price was right.  First impressions of the Resort were overall very positive!  Check-in was super quick and the hotel staff was very friendly.. . From there, things went downhill.  The room presented reasonably well.  However, once being in the room for more than 20 minutes, things started showing.  The room felt "old" and used.  Sitting and laying on the bed (king size suite) was generally uncomfortable, as the bed had obvious indentations from bodies sleeping.  The room lamp (looks cool!) was beaten and battered...the phones didn't work, and we were completely locked out of the fridge!  We noticed stains on the comforter, and some of the towels had brown marks on them! Does Mandalay Bay wash their linens?!  The towels themselves were very rough, and felt more like sandpaper than a luxury towel.  The shower, while generally nice, lacked sufficient hot water to make it through the morning routine.  Two mornings in a row! What gives?!. . When these problems were brought to the staffs attention, there was a complete lack of courtesy, as they inquired that "despite your problems, are you enjoying your stay?"  They did not care about the problem, and made no effort to resolve the issues.. . We won't be going back to Mandalay Bay, unfortunately!!
I have been to Mandalay Bay on many occasions over the years. In its heyday, the rooms were nice and reasonably priced. The hotel is definitely showing its age but there are still many positive things about the property.. . Their parking is convenient and its one of my favorite properties based on location alone. They have many different dining options, many of which I have tried and enjoyed. Obviously Mandalay Beach is a favorite because of their pool and lazy river as well as their summer concert series. They offer many different shows in their events center as well as their theater over the years and I always look forward to their options. . . Overall, I enjoy this property as there is a little something for everyone here.
After reading MANY reviews of five and near five star resorts in Las Vegas, one may get the impression that the North end of the strip. Isn't the North strip home to the boarded up Sahara? The Fontainebleau Las Vegas that never even opened? And lest we forget the opulent Circus Circus? The South Strip is where the action is! And it has fewer of those nasty card peddlers!. . The crown gem of the South Strip is obviously Mandalay Bay Resort! Just walking in you can smell your in a different world. Marble and other expensive building materials are everywhere! And the outside of the building is acres and acres of exotic waterfalls, sculpture gardens and trees! And unlike Wynn (NICE but North Strip) Mandalay Bay has real grass and plants. Even the Palazzo is using fake plants these days. What's with that? Anyway - the grounds look and feel expensive because it cost a fortune to build. And it's comfortable and quiet in most of the public spaces except the pool area (second to none) and the exciting casino.. . This resort underwent a room renovation a few years ago to kill off the beach bungalow look and removed any trace of of a tropical theme. The new room decor is bright, modern and welcoming! Sound-proofing is good and the bathroom is massive and includes two sinks and an HDTV.. . Some people say that visitors to Las Vegas don't spend time in thier room. WRONG again! Why do you think the rooms and suites keep getting bigger and more plush? Because people do spend time in their rooms relaxing and entertaining or maybe even kicked back on the bed watching a high-def movie. Ask anyone who has spent a lot of time at the nicer resorts and they will tell you that the floor to ceiling glass curtain wall provides the most spectacular views of the strip. The whole strip just unfolds in front of you at night.. . The resort is also home to one of the worlds largest convention centers and it's own event/concert center. And every food choice imaginable is available either at the resort, at Mandalay Place or a quick tram-ride to Luxor, Excalibur, NYNY and the MGM Grand. And unlike the Las Vegas monorail the tram is free and better located. You have to walk miles to catch the monorail.. . The only thing I noticed on my last trip that needed some attention was the parking garage. It used to be kept cleaner but I noticed empty beer and other liquor bottles scattered around. Guess I wasn't invited to the party!. . I've only seen the massive pool area a few times, but it includes a lazy river, a wave pool, beach, and numerous pools including a more adult one. The pool complex would be awesome if they could just nix the children completely (especially the loud ones) but some resorts must bear the burden of accommodating children. But Las Vegas is NOT a family destination. . . I've enjoyed this resort for many years and plan on returning again soon. Be sure to see the photos.. . Room Tip: High floor room facing the strip!. . Side Note: I have not been in a year and refused to go, until they do an early cancellation of a Michael Jackson show. He frightens children and most adults and is dead.
