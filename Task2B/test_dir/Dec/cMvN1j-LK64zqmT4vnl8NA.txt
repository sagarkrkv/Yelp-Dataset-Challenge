I think that Jose Andres must have been smoking weed when he thought of this restaurant concept.  He probably got the munchies and thought, damn I need to get me some greasy ass Chinese food or Mexican food.  It would be great if there was a place that served both. Bingo!. . Then he sobered up the following day and created the menu as well as the prices.  It takes the clarity of corporate gluttony to take well-loved comfort food that is cheap and then charge more than 4 times the norm for it.  And it takes an idiot like me who will walk in and pay for it.  So I'm gonna call you out right here, Jose.  You have had me shell out tons of my hard earned money at your other establishments for fantastic cuisine that clearly distinguished you from your peers as well as served as an homage to your roots training under Adria Ferran of El Bulli. But you won't fool me again in ordering your f***g pathetic excuse of $25 fried rice. I felt like I was eating at Disneyland or at the airport.  Yes, I know that high quality ingredients adds cost.  But the food should taste better than the fried rice dish my sister made for me when she learned to cook at 9 years old..not an exact replica.. . But the tacos here are pretty good, despite the sticker shock.  Chilaquiles are also good, but probably not as good as you mom made them, unless your mom was Chinese.  But that is what everything more or less tastes like here.  Mexican food like it was done by a Chinese chef, and Chinese food like it was done by a Mexican chef. Somewhat creative, good quality ingredients, but lacking the comfort that we expect these foods to provide.. . But I would definitely not classify this place as fusion cuisine. It is more like what you get when you come across a Lousiana Fried Chicken - Hong Kong Express joint.  . . Just whatever you do, don't get the fried rice.  Curiosity killed the cat on this one.
We couldn't believe this place. A tiny taco costs u $6. Come on, PLEASE. I ordered the noodle that the bartender recommended, It's so small that i thought "it's gotta take 4 of these to fill me up". When we wanted separate, he gave us a weird look. Come on man. you never asked us if we wanted separate checks. . Save your money, take a cab to Chinatown (2 miles from the strip). and get some real Chinese (or Vietnamese, or Korean).
I've died and gone to the hacienda in the sky! Are you kidding me?!! Fluffy, meringue like salt ion top a fresh lime margarita. Just try and remove me from this bar stool! . . Between the barbacoa taco, chorizo with my fondido, chipotle salsa and now the Salt Air Margs, I need to eat here daily!  The chips the best, I hear they make em too. I'm watching the lady make those fab corn torts this place may be in Vegas but I feel like I'm in the Yucatan.  . . I love the Cosmo hotel my go to stay when in Vegas now I think I'll stay more often.
Always a bad sign when the waitress askes you to remove your dirty fork fron your dirty plate to put on your dirty table for second course. Would hate to trouble you after charging $18 for fried cheese tapas. Seriously? I think we have grown accustom to 20% and have totally stopped working for it.
Walking in the place has a very relaxed vibe and beware the chairs are heavier than they look. Ha. . Our waiter recommended the mango margarita which has the perfect hint of spice. I took him up on it and was not sorry. We ordered the chips and salsa, fried wontons, several tacos and a Caesar salad. The first thing that came out was our tacos, random. . . However, they were delicious! If you're not too hungry go that route. The salsa is a chipotle style so it was a nice contrast. They add a spice to the chips that rocks. The wontons are not crazy deep fried and they come with a nice sauce. I didn't eat the salad but my mate said it was the best he's had in awhile, I'll take his word for it. . . It was a casual easy going experience and I definitely recommend trying it!
Las Vegas in between the aria and Cosmo . . Afreakingmazing . . Dan dan noodles. Pruselas (Brussels). Chilaquiles amazing. When pigs fly . . Try the baja. . Don't get the lobster taco
Our group of 4 ate here one night and got a mixture of tapas:  tacos, black pepper shrimp, noodles and vegetable fried rice.  Everything we had was good but the prices make it hard to get enough to get full.  We had to hit secret pizza afterwards. I'd go back though to try a few other things, knowing not to try and make a full meal out of it.. . Just as an aside, the decor in there is kind of weird.  A mixture of a bunch of things that didn't make any sense.
At first I was hesitant to try this place because I am not really a big fan of Mexican food, but this place surprised me. Combining chinese and Mexican food is a wow. Most of the food made authentic. The traditional Siomai was my favorite. They actually put gold on top. It was pretty good.They have weird names of soup but oh my god, taste so good. The dessert is also amazing, my favorite is the sticky rice with mango but with a twist. This place really surprised their customers. They are very creative. They have good customer service and they are ready to help you with your questions and orders. The place is Beside marquee. They have a comfortable lounge outside while waiting for your seAt and table. The service is fast and the food is incomparable. I will come back here and I will recommend this to my friends.
The verdict in this place...identity crisis? This place is not fusion. It truly does serve both Chinese and Mexican cuisines. The server deems it authentic, but with a culinary twist. So, if the Chinese dishes may be a favorite for you at your Chinese restaurant, then it may not be what you expect at China Poblano. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. But overpriced and super salty. The Ocean's Nest pan fried seafood noodle was almost $40. Way too salty. The Dian Dian Mian was good but salty again.
Very very little serve and very very expensive . I ordered a Dan Dan Mian.  Very large bowl but you can finish it within two bites!  Kengdiebility!
I've been here a few times, it's an interesting mix of Mexican and Chinese.  Some of the items are really hit or miss.  . . The last time we went we sat at the bar and Sarah schooled us on tequila, that girl is full of tequila knowledge, some really interesting stuff.  We had a few tequila flights, very interesting taste testing.  . . The caldo tlalpeno wasn't that good had a odd flavor.  The 20 vegetable fried rice ($19.88)was just ok, until I added monk sauce($2.88), it added some flavor to it. The rou jia sandwich was pretty good, the pork was very sweet tasting.  Now the shrimp mojo, looked bad, but was very good.  . . Would I suggest this place, boy that's a tough one, the menu is such a mine field, maybe I would and suggest sticking to the tacos and tequila.
Looking at the menu was upsetting. . . I think it set the mood all wrong. . $5 for ONE taco. $8 for FRENCH FRIES the size of an in n out fries.. $12 for a bowl of SOUP/POSOLE. . . Then we were like screw it we are hungry so we are just going to order. The restaurant is located in Cosmo on the second floor I believe. It's casual but pricey. Half the restaurant is Asian cuisine and the other half is Mexican. We came in cause it looked casual and the ambience was nice and colorful casual informal unlike many of the other eateries in Cosmo. . . Food was average not that great for my expectations of a $5 taco and $8 fries.. French fries were just whatever in a small basket with a mole taste like soy sauce dipping sauce. We asked for ketchup. NO KETCHUP?? But you serve fries I just don't understand. . . Soup was all right. Posole. Usually I like posole but this one was Okay. Had to add a bunch of limes. . . The Hawaiian heart of Palm salad was unique. My mom liked it cause she has never had it. . . Overall would not come back again. . Only nice thing was that the man gave us a disclaimer that everything was tapas style. . . I love tapas but here is not the place to eat when you're hungry and want good food worth your buck.
My wife and I dined here on Christmas Eve with another couple. The restaurant was maybe two-thirds full and we were happy to be sat at our table 20 minutes prior to the start of our 7:00pm reservation. Our drink and food orders were taken promptly and all was going well until we received the bill. . . This was at 7:30pm.. . Our waiter assured us that it was no problem to split the checks per couple. We obliged and he said he would return with a check for each couple. The checks he dropped were wrong and we asked for them to be corrected. In addition, I reminded him that I had comp points on my Cosmopolitan players card that I would like to be used. I even wrote it on the itemized receipt as a reminder. . . He returned with the correct checks and took our credit cards as well as my Players Card, came back to our table with the cards swiped and I notice he hadn't used my comp points. He took my check again and applied the comp points.. . We leave the restaurant at 8:25pm.. . It took us longer to pay our bill than it did for us order and eat our food. We could not have been more disappointed with our experience. To make matters worse our waiter did not even acknowledge the fact that he took 55 minutes to cash us out. . . As a Vegas local it always amazes me that, in a town that prides itself on the Hospitality industry, that we would find such terrible customer service. . . My wife and I will not be back. The food was alright, but thelack of attention to detail by our server ruined our dining experience.
The service was adequate, and menu choices were a little more than a little overpriced. I ordered the street style pork sandwich, the pork was pretty much the equivalent of a blue rare. The sandwich was the size of a small biscuit, and depressingly unfilling. Before this, i had ordered a pork taco with green salsa (forgot name, sorry, this review is written in retrospect), and the pork was well cooked, except that the taco was soggy as a result of the pork grease. My friend had dim sum, so size wasn't much of a problem for her, she did say though, the dim sum had an off-putting oder, but tasted fine. Overall, the place was sub-par and I wouldn't go here again. Another note: The drinks offered there are served in bottles, which means no free refills. Just know that these bottles are the size of a soda can, and depending on what you order, you may or may not be getting less than your money's worth(or even less still), as some of the bottles are smaller than others. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, overpriced and the food is repulsive.
I liked this place until I find out a long hair in my vegetable fried rice until I find out. I wouldn't come back this place.
When you're Hungry... and I mean HUNGRAY! Give this combo Asian and Mexican fusion a try. I was pleasantly surprised. I Will Most Def Go Back... and the cute bartender extraordinaire Sarah is an Amazing and well trained specialist. She'll Hook You UP!
Great food and service. The golden pork buns are amazing! Using the condensed milk as a doing sauce is genius, as only Chef Andres could do.
My god. This is the worst restaurant in the strip. The worst restaurant I tried in 2014. You get the idea. It exemplifies why fusion food is sometimes a bad idea. We arrived in a group of 10 and shared a lot of food. Every time I took a bite, I instantly thought of some place where the dish is so much better. $6 taco? Even the $1.50 ones from the taco truck from the ghetto are so much better. The noodle dishes are an embarrassment to the Chinese. Save your money!!
This place is amazing! Drinks are out of this world.
This restaurant confuses me. Perfect example of bad fusion. It's not even really fusion since it's just 2 concepts in the same restaurant (you can get a taco and noodles). . . I had the open sesame which was ok. Not bad, not good but definitely not worth the $14. Friend has the pork sandwich ($10) that was TINY. And he got his meal 5 minutes before us and has already finished it before we got our noodles. Bad timing. . . The customer service was good, everyone was nice but overall was a weird experience. Just not worth the money.
WaYYYY overpriced! Food is ok nothing to great. The menu was terrible to describe the Chinese food. I ordered the Open Sesame. Was pretty good. The atmosphere gives asian fusion a bad name. If your looking for a place to eat at in the Cosmo, do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else. Your wallet and taste buds will thank you. I will say the customer service was excellent. Nice staff.
Scallops were delicious. If you get an Identity Membership card at the front desk (free btw) you get a complimentary margarita with the purchase of a margarita.. . Overall, definitely an interesting menu combining both latin and asian cuisine to form a fusion of deliciousness.
