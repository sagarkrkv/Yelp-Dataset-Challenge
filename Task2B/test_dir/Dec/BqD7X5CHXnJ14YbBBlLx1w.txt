This is the place to go for tapas in Las Vegas. Not only is it inside Aria which gets you to City Center, but it's done by chef Julian Serrano and is cearly one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. Make this a destination.  I have been a number of times and always love the Tortilla Espanola (which is my own measure of a great Barcelona style tapa wherever I go for tapas). Julian Serrano's does not disappoint, but they have changed the recipe recently and its lost something (different olive oil or less egg?). Same story with the Pan Catalan which is now on a tiny split baguette - clever, but it's less authentic. The choices are many traditional Spanish tapas and a number of newer tapas. You can't go wrong, but absolutely leave space for the churros con chocolate!
It's hard to find good, authentic Spanish food outside Spain. It's just not prevalent outside the largest cities with some sort of expat Spanish population.. . For those who've traveled to Spain, "tapas-style" dining in the US is frustrating because something gets lost in translation with the taste and presentation. Not to mention that it's more expensive here.. . Julian Serrano is not for the budget conscious. It is a celebrity-chef restaurant in a glitzy Vegas casino.. But, the food is good, authentic, and has several options for all palates. I've been to Jaleo (Jose Andres' restaurant in DC), and this is on par.. . Had the Paella Valenciana and a couple of tapas: Croquetas de pollo and pimientos de pardon. Peppers were hotter than what you'd normally get and the croquettes were delightful. Paella was on point as well: from the rice to the saffron, on down to the pan.. . Good selection of Spanish wines too. Nice spot just off the lobby in the Aria for some prime people watching.
Wow Wow Wow..tapas style and heaven in my mouth. awesome food. You can try little of each so you are not stuck with one huge meal of the same thing. My fav is the black rice and the risotto. I will definitely be back and next time..Paella.  This place is good for big groups so you can order alot and have lil of each plate. We also sat next to Wanda Sykes who im a big fan of..made the dinner even better.. The only complaint i have is the price of course..but ill be back and still pay.
Great tapas and whatever we ordered was good and tasty. Compliments to the chef. Very creative and I recommend the rice pudding for desert. Never had anything like it. Over all great place and fun restaurant to eat specially when u sit at the bar.
Their tapas menu has so much variety. The bacon wrapped dates, chicken croquets, burger sliders and stuffed peppers are amazing. We've had Justin wine and it was yummy! I recommend this place for any occasion
We had a great experience here. Our server was very nice and friendly. The food came out at a quick pace. My wife and I ordered 6 tapas, two glasses of wine a piece, shared a flan for dessert, and had one dessert drink a piece, all for about $200 which is a good deal for a high end restaurant in Vegas. The Tapas were the 5j ham (touted as the best ham in the world; it's like prosciutto strips- small amount but very flavorful and should be eaten first); the potatoes (spicy with an interesting dollop of cream on top; the asparagus (it was perfectly prepared and seasoned- the best asparagus we've ever had anywhere); the stuffed peppers (these were very good too, perfect spice level);  the oxtail (this was fairly sweet with a light pastry keeping it held in a circle; a little too sweet for me but perfect for my wife); and the pulled pork pan (this was surprising better than I thought it would be, mostly because of the shredded vegetable topping). . . The atmosphere was loud and outgoing. Mostly there were large groups there that night. Seems like a great place for parties or business dinners for a fun experience. Not going to be a quiet romantic dinner however.
Visited this place two days in a row. . Nothing much to say about this place.. Everything is good except fried calamari.. . I tried. 1.Black rice: MUST EAT. 2.Lobster fideua:MUST EAT. It has very interesting texture.        . 3.Grilled lamb chop: It was tender, juicy, has a good lamb flavor!!! BEST lamb chop I've ever had . 4.fried calamari: wasn't good, not tasty at all.. 5.Marinara Paella: MUST EAT
D-Lish-us!!. With my friend, Beth we had:. Lamb chop. Seared scallops. Ceviche (my favorite!). Stuffed piqullo. Gambas. Cheese platter . Stuffed dates. Spicy bomba. . . Next time we're for sure getting the paella!!. . The service is top-notch. Highly recommend!!
One look at the menu and I knew I was in trouble. The combination of my friend's propensity for over-ordering and ours both for over-eating...well, it's a gluttonously dangerous time.. . There had to be at least 70 items on the menu. And this was for LUNCH! It's a massive selection of dishes. Everything looked so good, it was hard to narrow down. But our server was helpful in making suggestions.. . I recommend coming here in a large group so you can share and taste as many tapas as possible. We were a party of 4 and we had 12 dishes with a pitcher of red sangria:. . Brava Potatoes - A tapas staple, and it's done right here.. . Oxtail - One of my favorites of the day.. . Pan Serrano - Mini baguettes with slices of serrano. Solid.. . Huevo Estrellados- Skinny fries with a fried egg and Spanish pork chorizo that tasted to me like Chinese sausage. Overall, an ok dish.. . White Ceviche - This was a generous portion. It was too spicy for me, but the group liked this dish a lot.. . Fresh Calamari a la Plancha - I love calamari served whole like this, and this was a group favorite. Very flavorful and perfectly cooked.. . Octopus - This was everyone's least favorite; it didn't have much flavor.. . Foie Gras - I hoarded all this for myself, haha. Seared foie with roasted apple. Perfection.. . Stuffed Dates - Medjol dates stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in crispy pancetta sounded a bit heavy to me at the time, but one bite and I was sold. These are seriously good.. . Albondigas - Another tapas staple, again, superbly done. Who doesn't like Spanish meatballs?. . Beef and cheese - Good, not great.. . Cobia - We ordered this fish dish as an afterthought, and it was one of the surprising highlights of our meal.. . Overall, very much a 5-star lunch experience.
A friend and I went to Julian Serrano for lunch after seeing an advertisement for a $20 special 3-course tasting menu from the Aria website. However, after we were seated, we were told that they could not honor the fixed pricing menu because they "were too busy."  The restaurant was not even half full. Surprised, I verified with the server and also the manager that I had come at the correct time under the advertisement, which didn't mention any sort of limitation to the deal. They both told me that I came at the correct time, but that they still could not honor their advertisement, with no reason other than they were too busy to honor it. They then told me I could order similar items at their FULL PRICE ($40-50 per person).  I am shocked at their bait and switch tactics, and will not be returning.
Delicious! The tuna cones were the very best! The salmon cakes were also very good. My friend tried the chicken skewer which she says were okay. Service was spot on.
If you are into the Vegas scene, then you'll like this place. The ambience is very classy, and pretty much your typical, "club atmosphere" scene. The food is delicious, but the portions are very small. I would recommend purchasing at least three tapas per person. You'll even have room for dessert. The molten chocolate cake is very delicious. The price is pretty high, but you're paying for the experience along with small portions of the tapas.
3.587362 round up to 4. Still a 4, but barely.. . We ordered this time:. . - Spanish iberico sliders - prime beef, iberian pork, caramelized onions. - Gambas - sauteed shrimp, garlic, brava sauce, arbol chili. - Brava potatoes - spicy tomato, aioli sauce. - Creamy risotto - wild mushrooms, aged manchego cheese. - Tuna cones - ahi tartare, cucumber, crispy won ton, avocado, ponzu. - Lobster fideuna - angel hair pasta, half lobster tail, roasted red pepper. - "Bomba" - veal tenderloin and pork tenderloin, spicy meat ball, spicy rocoto sauce. . While each item was above average, I would expect more than "above average" from a restaurant with the name of the great chef himself. We've visited this place twice so far, tried more than 10 items total, and our taket is consistent.. . Located next to the main lobby area, the convenience and casual factor is a plus with the open layout, but food-wise nothing was really remarkable.. . Considering how we were impressed with his renowned restaurant, Picasso, . this is a bit of a disappointment.
We really love this restaurant.  The service was impeccable!  Yoshi was our server.  You'd be surprise, but it's good for families.. . We ordered a variety of dishes, from the croquettes, to the ham, to the seafood.... Everything was tasty and we would come back in a heartbeat to try more dishes.
Had a wonderful meal with my husband. Our wait staff made sure we had time to get to our show on time.  They were gracious and I enjoyed my first absinthe experience.
Loved this place!!!! With a variety of options ranging from chilled seafood, to in the shell, to ox, to paella, what's not to love! Plates are served in a traditional tapas manner - small yet packed with flavor. The boyfriend and I highly approved and will definitely head back on our next visit to Las Vegas!
To start, the restauraunt is very very comfortable and colorful.  The staff is very attentive, knowledgable and goes above and beyond to accommodate special requests.  The selection of Tapas is extensive, presentation of dishes is creative and . Pleasing to the eye.  The Mussels, Kale salad, Soup, Braised Short Ribs were delicious.  The Sangaria was addictive.  Looking forward to returning to try other Tapas.
We really enjoyed Julian Serrano at the Aria.  We didn't try the paella, just feasted on tapas, all of which were super tasty.  I would especially recommend:. . -- oxtail (raba de toro). -- Yellowtail. -- croquetas. -- charcuterie plate. -- padron peppers. . We had a delicious wine from Spain's Ribera del Duero region that went perfectly with the food.. . The only complaint was how fast everything came out -- we finally had to ask the server to slow down the orders (which they did).  I always forget how fast Vegas service typically is.. . A definite recommend!
We come to Vegas every year for Christmas, and we always eat at Julian Serrano as it had been consistently great. Tonight, however, was a major disappointment - not the great food & service we have come to expect.. . Food:. Picas (chicharrones, olives, almonds) - excellent . Foie gras with Apple - good but the foie was a little overcooked, and there was too much Caramelized apple, which made it too sweet. Gazpacho - excellent. Patatas Brava - spicy tomato sauce was sweet and not spicy at all, and the potatoes were soggy instead of crispy outside and fluffy inside. This is usually a fave of ours, but we sent it back.. Octopus - well cooked, but not seasoned (no salt). Oxtail - too sweet. Stuffed dates - too sweet (tasted like they used candied bacon). White Sangria - tasted like watered down white wine - no hint of brandy or fruit, despite pieces of apples and oranges in the pitcher. . Service:. Lackluster. We like to order a couple of tapas at a time, then order more as we go along. The waiter forgot several of our orders until prompted, didn't return to take our order when we indicated we wanted to order more, etc. Not horrible, but not the attentive service we have received here in the past.. . In the past, we have spent 2 1/2 to 3 hours ordering many tapas and then dessert. Tonight we got so fed up that we stopped ordering and didn't even get dessert. We only spent 1 1/2 hrs there. All in all, a disappointing evening.
Good restaurant to visit if in the CityCenter. The New York Steak and other meat tapas were very good, albeit small. Most of the salads were very good as well, especially the Queso Fresco. The Queso Fresco is like a Caprese salad, except wrapped up.. The shrimp dishes were terrible, with only 2-3 pieces of shrimp. To make it worse, they were served in a puddle of bland sauce. There was so much sauce, you had to fish the shrimp out from the pool of sauce. . The restaurant atmosphere is very modern and stylish like the Crystals. The seating area is located at the entrance to the Aria from the Crystals, and because of this, can be prone to drafts of wind coming in, although this is not a problem unless it is cold outside. In addition, the restaurant itself is relatively small and a little cramped with all the tables they try to fit in. It would have been nicer if they spread the tables out a bit. Overall, dining at the Julian Serrano was a positive experience.
I cannot say enough great things about this place. . . The space was open, modern, vibrant and energetic. . . The waitstaff was attentive, friendly, fun and accommodating.. . The food was amazing, I dare to say some of the best tapas I have EVER had. The Spanish tortilla, the lobster gazpacho and the creme brulle arroz con leche were out of this world. . . We had the pre theater tasting menu which was an amazing deal for the quality and generous portions that we received. . . Thank you for making our night so much better with a perfect and beautiful dinner!
Pedro was a fantastic server! Food was amazing
