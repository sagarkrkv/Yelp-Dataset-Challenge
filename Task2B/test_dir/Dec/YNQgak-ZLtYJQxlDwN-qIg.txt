For $43 brunch on a Sunday afternoon + an hour wait, I thought it was just O-K. I feel like I basically paid a good amount of money to eat an omelet and some crab legs. I was pretty upset about how gross their oysters looked. They were so NOT fresh; they were BROWN. The selection was meh, the food was meh, the desserts were also meh. Everything about this buffet screams mediocre. . . It's funny because as we were waiting in line to get in, we had several people telling us not to eat here. We were stubborn and got stuck with trying a whatever buffet. I don't think it's worth trying unless you want to waste your money and wait a long time for disappointment.
It is amazing. Very decadent and worth the price. I tried a little of everything excluding all off the pork and beef dishes (which is quite a few things). I found myself laughing at how ridiculous I was at 830 in the morning. Artisan cheese and grapes salmon salad chicken noodle soup sushi fruit yogurt some kind of shrimp egg roll  and sooooo much more was delicately crammed into my mouth. I will come back here every time im back in Vegas. I heard that the line can be very long at times but that was not our experience.
Good, but not great Vegas buffet. A bit disappointing after an incredibly long waitand pricey charge (at the holiday rate). They have all the classics, but very few special offerings or star dishes. I found the food variety and flavor to be stronger at the Bellagio and Bacchanal buffets. . . The sole stand out was the apple cranberry cobbler. Fantastic end to a so-so meal.
Beautiful setting with good buffet food but the wait and host/hostess staff were bad.  When they were seating us they sat our party & 2 others at the same time & I overheard the first party say there were 10 of them & the hostess said "well I don't know nothin' about no party for 10, this is for 2, you guests be gettin' on my nerves today," and some other rant and rave-nothing that was very pleasant or hostess like. Then we sat there for several minutes waiting for someone to take our drink order & when I saw the waiter serving the table next to us I asked if we could have coffee & juice, and after we got it we NEVER saw him again.  Won't go back.
Bottomless Sunday brunch was just ok. The food was typical bulk standard and most dishes were lukewarm. We were with a large party, so a hefty gratuity was already included despite the subpar service.  The Bloody Mary was below average, so I would skip the bottomless option. Overall, the brunch buffet was way overpriced for simple, average food quality and mediocre service. Two stars because it is 'good for large groups'.
How far the mighty have fallen. If you read my previous review, written in 2008, I used to love the Wynn buffet. I haven't been to the Wynn buffet in a few years...pretty much since Wicked Spoon and the Bacchanal Buffet opened. My partner-in-crime Brian V. and I were in town over Thanksgiving and felt nostalgic so we decided to revisit the Wynn for Thanksgiving brunch. We arrived at about 10:30 am and the line was not too long. This buffet is truly frozen in time...nothing has changed as far as the types of food offered. It is really just standard buffet food circa 2000. I got some turkey breast, slab bacon, and an eggs benedict. The turkey breast was so dry I almost choked on it. The eggs benedict was completely overcooked to the point of rubber and was completely inedible. I was honestly shocked at the awfulness of this food. My dining partner went straight for the shrimp. As soon as he sat down I could smell a strong odor of ammonia...like seafood that had gone bad. When we looked at the shrimp it was pretty obvious that he should not eat them...some had even started turning green. When my champagne arrived it was in a dirty glass...and when I say dirty, I really mean filthy. Upon further inspection all of the glass wear on the table we equally as filthy. Very frightening!!! We were both completely nauseated and revolted...the manager gave us our money back and we left.. . Never again!
Meh!  Meh!   Meh!  . . This buffet was recommended to my boyfriend and I so we waiting in a loooooog line on a Sunday.    There were two things I was looking for in the buffet - crab legs and  Eggs Benedict.  This Sunday buffet did not offer *either* of them.  It was very disappointing.      There was nothing special about this buffet - it was the typical frozen food prepped and sitting out under a warming light.
I love this buffet, it's probably my favorite buffet in Las Vegas! Each dish is special and delicious. They have amazing seafood, like crab, cocktail shrimp, mussels, and sushi. It's all super fresh and totally worth the price. I was a bit skeptical at first because of some of the other reviews, but I can honestly say it was delicious, fresh, clean, and overall amazing! I'm happy tried it out, awesome dining experience!
In my honest opinion, this is one of the better Vegas buffet that I've eaten at. It's got all of your standard Vegas buffet fare: crab legs, sushi, prime rib, oysters, etc. What I like the most are all of the chef stations: The street tacos, the ramen bar, multi-meat carver. All the food is high quality but nothing is done spectacularly, which is a characteristic that seems like is all too common in the buffet game. . . Buffets aren't really my thing, so I probably won't be back. However, I don't really have a solid complaint. If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would.
AMAZING!!!!  We are locals so it's very hard to impress us with a buffet.  Everything we tried was delicious!!  Our waitress Melissa was awesome as well.  Thank you Melissa.
I have lived in Las Vegas for 22 years and have been to many buffets but none have ever come close to the experience I had at Wynn's buffet. The food was delicious and service was on point. The beef ribs were extra tender and the tuna poke melted in my mouth. Everything I tried was better than expected.  My server Melissa was very friendly and attentive. Great dinner.
This place really falls short of what I expect from Wynn.  While there were a few tasty dishes, most were pretty bad.  The sushi was inedible, and the only seafood they had was watery shrimp.  No crab legs.  No crab claws.  Poor quality food, mediocre selection. . . Also, the "20 minute wait" was actually closer to 45 minutes.
My boyfriend and I just had brunch yesterday morning. He insisted on going here because he said the food was excellent when he went years ago. We waited in a long line (35 minutes). We were totally disappointed with the quality of the food. Everything that should've been hot was mildy warm/cold. A complete waste of money. I'm giving it 1 star because the service was good.
This place was ok.   There is no crab legs/Shrimps in the buffet at all.. It was over price for what they served...
came there at 3rd of Dec.. Food quality is fair, little disappoint about no king crab, but the prime rib is very very good, . and the waitress service us very very........very good
We had complimentary passes to The Buffet from our stay at Encore.  We decided to check this place out for brunch.  The food is pretty much on par for any sort of buffet in Las Vegas.  The one item that was missing was crab legs.  I will most likely not be back as I am not a big fan of buffets.
I hadn't ever been to a buffet in Vegas but was excited because everyone talks about how amazing the buffets are in The various hotels. However, I must admit I was a little disappointed. The choices for Chinese food were good and thought the dumplings and spring rolls were tasty but other than that nothing to write home or Yelp about. The ramen bar wasn't what I thought...the packages that you buy at the grocery store have more flavor. We purchased the endless drinks. I would think with endless drinks we wouldn't have had to wait so long between even being asked if we wanted a refill. As with most buffets, you purchase your meal and then you are seated. However, it was irritating to be asked if we wanted to pay gratuity while purchasing our meals before even being seated. I am all for tipping and often overtip because I know how hard the wait staff works but to be asked beforehand is inappropriate.
How can you not give this place five stars in my opinion this is one of the top three buffets in Las Vegas.  They have food from so many cultures and none of it disappoints.  Be prepared to wait 30-45 mins online to get in.  The price is $35 for lunch and $50 for dinner.  My favorite foods to get are the prime rib, Alaskan crab legs, Tom Yum soup, and Italian meats.  If you have never been to this buffet you should definitely give it a try because you will be back!
Went here with a party of 4 on a Sunday, around noon.   You can pay an extra $16 per person for the VIP line for 15 minutes wait plus mimosa/champagne.  OR wait with the general masses and pay the regular price ($33?).  We did the latter and got seated in about 45 minutes. . . The drink server was okay.  Not overly attentive, but got everything we asked for. . . As for the selection of food, it didn't seem to have as much of a variety as Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace.   Highlights were the cuts of italian meat and cheeses, prime rib, lox, cocktail shrimp, and thick slabs of black peppercorn crusted bacon (kind of fatty, but delicious).  Dessert was good!  Highlights were the soy mint chip ice cream, cappuccino ice cream, passion fruit with tapioca, pretzel bar,  and cinnamon bread pudding. . . No crab or lobster during brunch hours I guess. . . One and done deal.  Try it and then head to Caesar's.
Get here early for lunch!  I got here at 12pm and waited about and hour on line before being seated.  It was worth it though.  The food was great and fresh.  They even had hand rolls!  The wait staff is very friendly. Food comes out very fresh.  I had bachannal for dinner a few months ago and wish I tried the buffet at Wynn instead.
They so not serve what you see here on yelp. No king Crab Legs, Lobster, etc. nothing good about this place. Paid 40 to get buffet you can get at a Chinese buffet back home. Save your money.
Came here for only two things. King crab & lobster and they had neither! Maybe since it was a Monday but still, if you are going to pay $40 for mediocre food like this I would've went with my first choice at the Rio. Thought this place would be nice and have a variety like the pictures and reviews. My husband and I were both very disappointed that it wasn't what we expected it to be especially thinking that it was at a high end hotel. Also waited forever for a refill on our drinks until my husband had to ask, then reading another fellow yelper's review, decided to check my glass cup & behold! It was filthy with water stains on it!! Regret coming here and spending $80+. Oh & BTW, prices are not $36 for Mon-Thurs. Went up to $40!! Never coming here ever again!
If you are a seafood lover... Shrimp, crab claws, raw oysters... then maybe it's worth the money, otherwise definitely not.  For over $40. per person some form of steak should be on the menu.  Maybe a small filet.  I'm not a steak lover but sure that many people would love to have it.  My wife enjoyed the rack of lamb. Most of the other dishes were fairly ordinary. No olives on a buffet?  The tacos were terrible.  Steve... you can do a lot better than this... you did when you opened Bellagio!. This, at best is a $30 - $35. buffet.
OK, Mr. Wynn, You can't win over a local that knows buffets.  This review is for their Saturday and Sunday brunch buffet. . First, there are NO accommodations for seniors and handicap.  In the long line that we were in there were practically no people over middle age.  Most  were young.  That said with that  long line we asked to be seated first because of an elder,handicapped and diabetic senior that was with us but they refused to do so without paying $16 per person extra.  Wow, that's despicable!   No way around it according to the on duty manager!  Isn't that against the law?. So if that older person came alone they would have to wait in that 45 minute line?  Really Mr. Wynn?. Second, the price that they charge for the brunch is a rip off.   They charge you for some eggs, waffles and choices of sausage that costs them less than other foods! . We payed nearly $36 per person and I could not fill up my plate with items that I liked.. Sure, the presentation was good as for example a small side salad was served in a cup sized strainer but overall the selection of the buffet WAS POOR !. Their green salad choices were pathetic though their desserts were pretty good. The service was attentive.. Overall, not a happy camper at all and I expected more for the price and from a place such as the Wynn hotel.  They might fool a tourist but not a local!
2 Stars.  Every dish is so-so at best. "More" at Luxor is better and is half the price. However, if you have the need to spend lots of money, go to Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan.
Salty snow crab legs, not King crab legs as advertised. Tough and overcooked prime rib. Was told a meat was lamb when it was clearly roast beef. Enough said....oh, and 'holiday'pricing for the same fare as normal days is ridiculous.
Came here for lunch one day. We were kind of hungry so we opted for a buffet. This buffet was pretty good in comparison to all the ones I've tried in Vegas.  They have a good variety of stations from Mexican, Asian, seafood etc. They also have a pretty good dessert station as well. Love their gelato flavors and their creme brulee! They also have vegan options available. The price per person is about $40. Reasonable for the options you have.
a lot of good foodie friends recommend us to try Wynn buffet, it's rated in their top 3 Vegas buffets, so we decided to give it a try. What a disappointment, maybe we went in with high expectation, maybe we were just mad that we gave up our one night in Vegas to Wynn instead of Bacchanal.. nonetheless, the Buffet doesn't taste like it's worth the $40 price tag. We felt like we were paying $40 for Golden Corral type of food.. The selection on Saturday dinner were very limited, how can they call a Chinese station with only Chow mien, fried rice and some steamed dumplings? and a sushi station with 3 sorry type of California roll looking thing? They were missing the basics?? and Italian station had 4 different pastas but tasted the same. I don't know man, and the taste wasn't that great either. half of dessert section were candy apples.. err.. anyway, just don't think it's worth $40, not even close.. I had much better buffet for half of that price before.
Absolutely overrated. We had to pay extra to use the VIP lane, otherwise we'd have to wait for over an hour just to get in.
too pricey , not a lot of choices I expected much base on the reviews It didnt ment my expectations bad chrismas dinner for us, i dont mind paying but it has to be worth it.
This is a painful review to write as I have always stood up for The Wynn Buffet. Our experience today has forced me to revise my opinion. We waited for an hour to be seated ( better than the 5-6 hour wait we would have had at The Bacchanal Buffet) and once seated had great service from Sandra (the only stellar thing about the experience). The once excellent high quality beef offerings have become tough dry, chewy and over salted. Where is the Kobe beef that used to be here? For $125 for two (my husband had the $16 all you can drink mimosas, bloody Mary's, beer, etc) the selection of food was so mediocre. For a holiday buffet everything seemed warmed over, salty, bitter, over cooked and even the pizza was rubbery. The best items were the salads and desserts. Thank goodness I love salad and gelato. But $55 for salad and ice cream is just not worth it. Chinese food very salty and meh. Sushi was rubbery. The crab was hit or miss depending on what piece you had. Oysters were ok. The funny thing about this buffet was that I kept going to different stations to try everything, hoping to find a winner. No luck. The final insult came when we were asked by Rhonda to leave as we had been there over two hoursand there were people waiting in line for our table. I understand you have to draw the line somewhere but my husband hadn't had dessert yet and it felt so tacky after spending $125. I would not have minded if the beef had been tender and the veggies not over cooked and over salted. Shame on The Wynn. The Bacchanal is really MUCH BETTER. But Vegas is really a zoo this time of year so to really enjoy yourself wait till the holidays and conventions have abated. And avoid the Wynn until they up the quality of their offerings. It is just not nearly what it used to be.
The Wynn is a beautiful hotel. Amazing decor and attention to detail, so I expected the same with their buffet. In some regards it stood up to that statement, but in others it fell short.. . We went to the buffet during the breakfast and lunch crossover, thus had a chance to try items from both courses. Most of the food is good, but very cookie cutter. Some have mentioned that their smoked salmon is epic - and that's definitely true. Don't bother with the sushi, especially if it's your first time, it's highly disappointing. . . Their meat selection is very good. They also have a variety of different cusines - Thai, Chinese (Dim Sum), Mexican, Indian. Jack of all trades, master of none.. . The desserts were highly disappointing - some were too bland, other were overly sweet.. . For the price we paid, $23/person, I'd say it's good, not great.
Average Vegas buffet.  Great variety. Food is great. No complaints. The reason I give average is because it's on par with many of the other Vegas buffets we have been to and a bit over priced. We came about 930am during the new years holiday. We paid about $40 per person.  That's too much to pay for breakfast but not many other choices in the Wynn hotel for breakfast.
Was here on 12/29 for dinner buffet. Was considered holiday so they jacked the dinner price from thirtysomething to $49.99. With tax and tip it came out to $60. Honestly a TOTAL ripoff. Food was bleh. They had snow crab legs (no king crab) which was completely unacceptable when paying that much. I checked out the sushi bar and it was embarrassing to say the least. No sashimi and they had only 3 or 4 types of rolls. Minado's BLOWS them away. If you want to overpay for average buffet but want to be seen in a chic place, then go here. You're not paying for quality of food but the atmosphere. I do NOT recommend.. . Also there was a 2 hour limit which our waitress reminded us of as well as noting the starting time on the receipt. There also appeared to be a 2 max drink because my friend only got one refill on his OJ and the waitress never came back. I told him to ask for another but he didn't so we could be wrong.
Went for brunch. Awesome buffet. Didn't find as many seafood options but great for meat lovers.
