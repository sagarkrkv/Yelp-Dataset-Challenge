ate at koemx last year and made sure we would eat here again this year, we are from hawaii, so day after thanksgiving we had lunch here, last year it was a smaller location this is a larger restaurant they have two locations.  The fusion of korean and mexican is so genious they complement each other so well.  we had spicy pork, kim chee tacos, a large burrito with everything in it and the best nachos ever. and side orders of kim chee.  please open one up in hawaii so we dont have to long for the food all year.  this place is really a must try, we were served by the owner herself, the service was quick, clean, and prices reasonable, especially the portions are so large, you can try a variety of things and your bill will still be affordable, oh also tacos are only 2.00 dollars and you can have it with kim chee delicious.. . hawaii people you will love this place it really reminds you of the cooking we are accustomed to here in the islands a real melting pot of different ethnic cooking,  just so comfy and delicious
What a great strip mall find! On our way back to the hotel after a soccer game and the boys took over. The price was great, burritos were even better and they had spam musubi! We will be back every time we play at Ed Fountain park.
Korean fusion with Mexican. What the! But wow, it's pulled off nicely. My wife and I split the meals and had a lot left over, big portions at good prices. The service was pleasant and attentive, the restaurant is small, basic, but clean. But onto the food: . The chips were delish! Not your basic thin chips. And they include guacamole at no cost. . There are three menus, Korean, Mexican, and Fusion.. Fusion flautas with bulgogi meat. Heavenly. Three large flautas and seasoned guacamole & sour cream side. . Fusion Burrito. Good, not knock your socks off, but good. I'll just eat more flautas. . Bulgogi fries.....Yummy! More like nachos but with fries and Komex goodness. . All this, and a coke for $25. We'll be back. Oh yes, we'll be back.
I LOVE this place! Every trip I take to vegas I have to stop by here.. Its truly amazing!  Must try!!!
Service was good. But not sure if it lives up to the hype. I'm from Cali, so our standards for fusion food, especially anything with Mexican, is pretty high. I had the bugogi nachos with Kimchi... And, hmmm.... how do i say this: just like the desert in Vegas.... the food is pretty....dry.
Good food, good service,  food cooked to order, can't go wrong with any choices and price is reasonable. One downside is they don't have  TO GO menu you have to go on the internet to look at the menu to order.
First Korean-Mexican fusion place my girlfriend and I have been to.  We got the bulgogi fries and an order of rice and 2 meats.  Food was good!  Service was attentive as well.  No complaints here! :)
I really wanted to really like this place.  Alas, it's just average.  I ordered the shrimp tacos, fish tacos, kimchee fried rice with shrimp, and nachos.  It was all fair.  The rice had a nice egg on top and tasted reminiscent of kimchee, but the shrimp (for which I paid extra) were non-existent.  Also, it lacked flavor and the rice was flabby.  When I think of Korean food, never does flabby rice darken my thoughts.... . The tacos were pretty good, although the tortilla was too thick for my liking.  The nachos were good, but forgettable.  Also the area of town, and specifically the parking lot, are nightmares.  . . So I likely won't go back, but OTOH I wouldn't speak ill of the place either if someone suggested going....
After I devoured my meal in under 10 minutes, I texted my cousin (who recommended the place):. . "Why is this place SO good?!". . Not only that but it's also SO cost efficient after being used to being gauged while staying on the strip. KoMex is a fantastic little hole in the wall that is probably most well known to locals and also out of town foodies like me and my cousin. . . The inside is clean, well lit and full of the mom and pop/hole in the wall vibe. The server is also the host/cashier/everything but a cook so please be patient. We ordered:. . - Beef Bulgogi tacos: Wow, just wow. Perfectly cooked and seasoned beef neatly tucked in a corn tortilla. What took it to the next level was that the lettuce/tomatoes were marinated in a special type of vinaigrette that was part savory and citrusy at the same time. I've never tasted that type of flavor before in a taco but man was it phenomenal. . . - Kimchi fried rice with spam: Another fav. When I order this at Korean places, it can get super greasy but Komex got this shit down right. Right amount of spice, seasoning and spam to keep me shoveling in the rice spoonful after spoonful.. . - Chow Fettucine with veggies: Loved this dish. It was nicely seasoned with just the right amount of soy and the veggies had a slight crisp. I would order this again but with beef and also a full order!. . Definitely  coming back here the next time I am in town. Totally worth venturing off the strip for some good quality local grub!
Dammit, I really really wanted to like this place, and I still do want to, but it just didn't hit the mark for me. . . The restaurant is clean and neat, and the service was good. We were the only table in the entire restaurant for a good while before a few other tables shuffled in. We ordered the enchiladas with beef, pork AND chicken, a spicy pork burrito, beef bulgogi flautas, and kim chi fried rice. Everything was JUST okay, but I didn't get the fusion part at all. Other than the fried rice, everything tasted just plain Mexican to me, and not exceptional Mexican either. I didn't get the Korean fusion in any of our dishes at all.  In addition, all of the meat in the enchiladas tasted the same. I couldn't tell the difference between the pork and chicken at all, not even by looking at it. . . The kimchi fried rice was the best out of everything we ordered. It was flavorful with a hint of kimchi and the fried egg on top was a great touch. . . Sadly, the meal was extremely forgettable and I probably won't be returning. :(
Awesome service and taste!. You must try new taco taste in Vegas.. My daughter and I also like Kimchi Fried rice.. Fish and shrimp tacos are the best!!
went here today with my son and his girlfriend, we had the buldogis fries and the buldogis and spicy pork cheesesteaks.  I thought they were absolutely yummy and my son loved the spicy pork.  It was sooooo much food we took half of it home.  They were very friendly and service was great.  We will def be back to try other menu items.
Just amazing! I have never experienced a better fusion than Korean Mexican food. I absolutely love this place! I go here on every trip to Vegas! The Fusion Nacho's are incredible! I have had every Fusion item on the menu! Everyone is worth trying! My favorite is the lettuce wrap because I can eat healthy while at the same time eat something amazing! Give it a try!
Love this hole-in-the-wall just off the strip.  Can't complain about delicious and CHEAP food!!!. . Big fan of the Fusion Tacos!!  I tried the Pork Belly and Beef Bulgogi ones.. Kimchi Fried Rice with Spam was very tasty but a tad greasy for me.. Chow Fettuccine was basically Chow Mein w/fettuccine... get it?. . The only thing I wish I did get was the Fusion Nachos!!!!  Next time I'm back in Vegas, I will dine on this!!
