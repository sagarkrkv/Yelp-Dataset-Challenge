Soooo good.   Went here with some friends that recommended it.  My wife and I split some items.  First, we had the blue corn duck appetizer.  Really well done.  I have seen something similar on other menus, but this was perfect.  After this, we tasted our friends pumpkin soup and fell in love.  So, we had to order a bowl of this.  .   Then we split the veal steak.  The steak was cooked perfect and the sauce was to die for.  . .    I am not a fan of too spicy, nor do I typically enjoy southwestern flavors, but the spice was just right...and bobby's menu may have changed my mind about southwestern flavors.   . . I also took a bite of the lobster my friends ordered and that too was top notch, the sauce was amazing.. .     Well done Bobby.
I'm a big fan of Bobby Flay's shows (Iron Chef & Beat Bobby Flay) so I decided to splurge and take my family here for Thanksgiving dinner while visiting Vegas.. . Big mistake.. . The food is way overpriced for what you get.  You're basically paying for the name instead of quality food.  Basic cocktails are $12+.  Desserts are $11 and not big enough to share (no I'm not a pig either).  . . I ordered the pork tenderloin which was $36 for 3 tiny pieces (c'mon, it's not sushi!) and a very dry tasteless "tamale".  My dad and my wife had the turkey dinner for $38, again very small portions and they later told me it was cold!  My 12 year old son had the salmon which he really enjoyed, but for $32 can't you at least include 1 side??!!. . The best thing I can say about the restaurant is the bread basket!  The waiter warned us of the "spicy" bread which was not spicy at all - just a couple bits of jalapeno, but the cheese crust was delicious.. . The service was ok, but nothing special.  It took forever to get our food (we were there for 2 hours), but I can understand that due to the holiday.  The icing on the cake was walking out and nobody at the hostess bar said thanks for coming.  After dropping $280 for 3 adults and 3 kids, I will definitely not be back!
This was likely one of the best meals I've had.... I don't know, ever?  Okay, that may be a bit of a stretch, but it was definitely up there in terms of superior deliciousness.  My husband and I started with the blue corn lobster tacos.  Who knew you could shove so much flavor into three little tacos?! There were decent chunks of lobster and the balance of spicy, sweet and tart was spot on.  It was $20 for three tiny little tacos, but I can say with some certainty that I would definitely order them again. . . Okay, on to the entrees--I ordered the grilled lamb porterhouse chops and they were phenomenal.  They were tender, perfectly cooked to the recommended medium. A preserved serrano chile sauce and mint chimichurri accompanied the lamb and it was a combination of sauces that you pretty much want to put on everything. The blue corm tamale with basil butter was also pretty tasty, but I liked the goat cheese tamale that came with my husband's veal a little better.  Overall, I thought my dish was slightly better than his, but he devoured his plate easily and with no hesitations, so I doubt he felt the same.  . . Oh did I forget to mention the bread basket?  Also delicious of course.  The jalepeno corn bread was my favorite, but you really can't go wrong with any of them. The crusty french bread and blue corn muffin was also just ridiculous.. . We were so full after all this food that we skipped dessert.  This was probably a huge mistake as I imagine the desserts were probably equally as mind blowing.  I suppose this just gives us an excuse to go back the next time we're in town.  Don't miss this place.
This place was great. We had the Saturday Brunch. I loved the menu. We had a group of 4 so we could share everything. The burger had great flavor, the shrimp tamale and the pumpkin soup were the all stars. Probably everyone's least favorite was the salmon, but even the worst thing was good.
In short, fantastic! We've got the lobster, the lamb, the scallops, rabbit and pork tenderloin. Everything was fantastic but the lamb is out of this world good. . . Great attentive service too! All in all a great memorable dining experience.
We had brunch here for a bachelorette party. The bread basket was very good. Different kinds of bread, such as coffee cake. The pumpkin soup was delicious. The scrambled egg tostada was okay. Nothing special. The waffle was good. Chicken salad good. Our server Rafael was very friendly. Cocktails overpriced, no surprise though. They usually are. Good food, nice service, minus a star for being over priced for what you get.
I'll just go ahead and get my main gripe out of the way: Mesa Grill is one of the most unimpressive looking 'fancy' restaurants that I have been to.  If it wasn't for the fact that it is in the middle of Cesar's Palace, I would have guessed that it was just your average South-Western/Mexican restaurant.  It was when the hostess asked me to remove my hat when I realized that they take themselves pretty seriously here, and thanks to the food, rightfully so.. . My meal was delicious! I ordered the Tiger Shrimp Sweet Corn Tamale as an appetizer, the New York Steak as my main entree, and mash potatoes as a side.  I actually had a difficult time selecting what I wanted, because although the menu is small, most of the items were unusual dishes that I wasn't interested in trying.  The menu consisted of a lot of seafood and less traditional meats, and I just wanted something basic.  Thankfully everything that I ordered turned out to be really good.  The highlight was the shrimp appetizer.  It was ridiculously priced for how tiny it was, but the combination of flavors was outstanding.  The theme of the meal in general was flavor, and everything from the bread to the pear margarita that I ordered pack a ton of it.  . . In addition to my food, I tried my date's Pork Tenderloin.  It was amazing!  I would highly recommend it as a main dish, and it is most likely what I would order the next time I am here.. . Mesa Grill is not a place that I could eat at all of the time, nor is it a place I would take someone to impress with ambiance.  However, they have superbly flavorful food that was well worth the visit.  It will not be one of my 'go-to' places when I visit the strip, but I can see myself coming back from time to time.
*** PROS ***. * Gorgeous, high-end atmosphere. * Prompt, attentive service! Could not take a sip of water without it being refilled. Many servers took care of us, from water, to cocktails to the main meal, we felt we, the customer, were a priority.. * Fabulous food! Fresh, warm from the oven bread and muffins, salmon cooked to perfection with a black bean sauce, rich lobster with hominy cakes, and a succulent rib-eye steak were our main meals. Sides included double baked potato with horseradish, mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts with walnuts and pomegranate seeds. Everything was scrumptious! . * Restroom within the restaurant so we didn't have to wander back out onto the casino floor. . *** CONS ***. * Not really a con, just a fact. Dinner is pricey! Menu prices start at $32, and do not include sides.
Holy moly, you guys.  Talk about AMAZING FOOD!  Gah, I am still salivating over this meal and it's been 4 days!. . We love us some Bobby Flay, so naturally we would choose to spend one of our two nights at Mesa Grill.  It was our first time, and we were very excited.  Mesa did not disappoint!. . We had 7 pm reservations but headed to Caesars early to get drinks somewhere.  We ended up at Mesa early, and they were able to seat us right away. Perfect, cuz we were hungry!  We had a table in the back that was tiny and super close to our neighbors, but after the overall food experience, that didn't matter.. . We started with cocktails which were tasty.  I tried the grapefruit vodka drink and my hubby had the one with Hendricks and cucumbers.  I am a vodka lover, but we both agreed his was amazing and tastier than mine.  We ordered 2 starters - the tiger prawn tamale and the smoked chicken quesadilla.  The tamale was out of this world!  I could eat that sauce on basically anything...so good!  The shrimp were delicious and the tamale was sweet with big corn kernels throughout.  If you go, you MUST get this.. . A bread basket came with an amazing corn muffin (but only one...which was sad, haha), some jalapeno cheese bread and a raisin walnut bread.  Not sure why the 3rd one was there, but my hubby liked it.  . . We ordered a second round of drinks, and this is where one star comes off.   The waiter touted a certain margarita, but my hubby wanted the create-your-own style with his favorite tequila.  The waiter then said, "sir, if I may, you really need to get this one.  It's so smooth..." and bla bla bla, so he did, but asked for it on the rocks instead of up.  It came, up.  So we asked again for it on the rocks, and it came, but was only ok.  My hubby wished the server would have just let him order what he wanted.   . . For our entree, we shared the seared scallops and they were heavenly.  They were so crisp on the outside, well seasoned and perfectly done.  The grits it came with were amazing too.  Definitely recommend!. . Dessert was the toasted coconut cake and I honestly don't know if I've ever had cake that good in my life!  So moist, and so coconutty!  What I wouldn't give for another slice.... . The ambiance is a little casual for the price point, but still nice.  Our server was attentive but the pushiness about that marg was off-putting.  Sometimes you just have to let the customer order what they want.  All in all, this was the best food we had in Vegas and we will be back!
The grilled chicken was nice and juicy with delicious hot sauce drizzled over it. The mashed potatoes on the side were great. I also got the sauteed spinach which was delicious too. Great food with great service. Good option for a small group of people
I never miss Mesa Grill while in town -- it never disappoints!. . It is my favorite brunch place in Vegas -- they have a super interesting menu and everything is expertly prepared and served piping hot. I had the chilaquiles and I'm still dreaming of them. The perfect level of spice and crunch and the eggs were just amazing.  The bread bowl is too die for with spicy corn muffins and other goodies.  Even the cocktails and lattes are prepared perfectly too.. . The location in the Caesar's sports book is a great place to get started for an NFL Sunday!. . I can't rave enough about Mesa Grill!
New York strip steak... amazing. Burnt grilled outside, pink med rare inside, came with spinach and great chili sauces. Fries were crispy. Salmon club sandwich with smoked salmon. Really delicious. Large menu of margaritas and tequilas choice of triple sec, Grand Marnier etc. Totally yummy, no wonder he is called Bobby Flay-vor
Love Mesa Grill! Been there for both lunch and dinner and I'd have to say I prefer the lunch menu. Dinner is the typical steak, seafood etc. with a sudden flare.The lunch however has one of my all time favorite dishes: their shrimp tacos which comes with a tomatillo salsa and a mango salsa. Their queso fundido and rough cut tuna "nachos" are both great appetizers featured in both their lunch and dinner menus. Overall a great restaurant with excellent food and I'll continue to come back!
We were looking for someplace to have dinner before seeing Shania Twain in concert at Caesars on 12/9/14 & decided to give Mesa Grill a try. I don't like spicy foods but the host said most of the sauces could be "on the side" if needed. Our waiter was Arnel & he made us feel right at home. Friendly & attentive, he helped make our dining experience memorable. I tried their peach margarita since I like to try different fruit-flavored ones & it was yummy!. . Hubby ordered the grilled chicken & I ordered the grilled lamb porterhouse cops with the sauces on the side. I almost always order lamb when we dine out because my husband doesn't care for it. O.M.G.!!! From the very first bite, I knew this was, hands-down, the absolute best lamb I have ever had! Perfectly grilled, very mildly flavored & buttery soft, it was simply dreamy. If we had been home, I would have picked them up & cleaned all the meat off the bones! I did try a little of each of the sauces & although too spicy for me, they were very, very tasty & did add to the flavors.. . My previous #1 had been lamb sirloin in Jackson Hole & #2 was lamb chops in Cambria. This is my new #1 restaurant for lamb! Coming back here for dinner next time we're in Vegas for sure!
Shifty bartenders can't make a spicy margaritas at the best "Southwestern" restaurant in Vegas! #Flay's place  is old and dusty...
Had a brunch reservation on my final day in Vegas. I was looking forward to trying this restaurant due to the Bobby Flay name and rave reviews online.. . The food is overrated and i have had better food elsewhere in vegas. Our party had ordered:. . Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash: This dish had a good kick to it and the sauce was savoury but the sweet potatoes seemed undercooked and a little hard. There was hardly any chicken in the dish. Overall a disappointment. . Green Chile Cheeseburger: The patty tasted good but its a burger that I could have eaten anywhere and wasn't anything special.. . Honey Glazed Salmon: Decent but nothing special. . Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich: Dry and the panini was burnt and very dry.. . Overall, I was disappointed at the taste and quality of food offered at this restaurant. This restaurant wasn't very busy when I went compared to other restaurants in Las Vegas where line-ups are norm.
I must say that this was my favorite restaurant so far that I've ever tried. Seriously Flay is THE MAN. The food is stunning and the flavors are just perfect. Service was amazing and the atmosphere was modern and beautiful. Everything complimented each other perfectly. For an appetizer we ordered the rough cut tuna nachos. It looked gorgeous and the fish, sauces and oils were perfectly spicy and balanced! I could be happy just eating that itself. Then for my entree I ordered the coffee crusted filet mignon medium rare. Hands down amazing I can't even describe it. It's the best cut of meat I've ever had. Ever! I also ordered a side of mashed potatoes centered with creamy poblano cheese. I ate everything! My husband got the unshelled lobster with corn cakes. Absolutely tasty and father in law had the lamb chops with a tamale. Prices are expensive but totally worth it. You're in Vegas. Live a little. You'll be happy you went here.
Delicious ! We had the queso with blue corn chips, apple salad and green chili burger (with fresh cut jalapeno on our request) and it was pure pleasure. The salad was a brilliant mix of salty, spicey, sweet, crunchy and fresh. The burger was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. Staff was fantastic. Only downside was actually getting to the place itself bc it's buried inside Cesar's near the forum shop entrance. Well worth the hunt though...
