I would have given this place 5 if it wasn't for the horrible server we had. . . Pleasantly surprised here at Lavo . . Ambiance was great food was terrific. . . Meatball... Amazing and so so soft . Octopus ... Charred with some sort of lemon    Salad. So great. . . Carpaccio .... Amazing with arugula and parmesan.  . . Cavatelli with meat sauce and ricotta amazing   . . Seabass- light with a lemon sauce. Yum. . Chicken Marsala... Mouth is still watering. . . Seafood Alfredo. Shrimp, scallops, in a light cream sauce. Yum! Not overtly thick at all! . . Tiramisu ... No go for me. Just too much. . . . . . I was wowed.
Lavo is going down hill.I rated 5 stars on Tripadvisors about 10 months ago.The staffs looked exhausted and no smile on their faces.The meatballs were bland...no fresh herbs? Oreo Cookie desert was overly fried and oilly....used to be light and airy.Sad to say,Lavo used to be my must visit restaurant in Vegas.
My girls and I came here for brunch all the food was amazing. I had the Lobster Benedict with a spicy bloody mary and because it was my birthday, theygave me a complimentary strawberry shortcake for dessert. One of my friend's had the chicken sausage that was a little sweet and a little savory. Overall, the food was great and I recommend everyone visiting Vegas stop by and try this wonderful place
Food was good, service was ok but expected because it was pretty busy. Had an accident and spilled red wine on white shorts, disappointed staff didn't offer to help clean or offer anything to clean shirts just moved us to different table.
Food, service and ambiance were impeccable. Antonio is passionate about the food and wants to ensure you enjoy your experience.
I can't tell you just how impressed I was with Lavo.  I was pretty apprehensive going to dinner at someplace known for its club and not its restaurant.  This place exceeded my expectations!  They even have a live DJ playing music in the restaurant (not loudly, just the right volume to set the tone for a night out in Vegas).  A group of us went for my birthday.  The meal was amazing, the service was awesome, the birthday spanking by our waiter in the middle of the restaurant was unexpected.  A number of people in our party ordered steaks (which they are still raving about), my husband got their infamous meatball (it was both delicious and HUGE).  Good times, great food, cool ambiance.
Food and ambiance were very good. Nice creative place for vegas style dinner. I would go back.
We came here at 10 am on a saturday. Try to had brunch before it turn into a day club in which I came back in three hours!!!. . Had a bloody mary. Not bad but not as good as morels.. . Had lobster benedict, mac and cheese with an egg and pancetta, and Kobe signature meatball. Must have!!!. . Mac and cheese is best I ever had also.  Definitely coming back.
