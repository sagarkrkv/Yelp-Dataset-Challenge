The decor here is very "white" and somewhat sterile feeling, but otherwise lush as is most of Mandalay Bay. The menu was delicious. I had the surf and turf, and it was creatively made and presented. Highly recommended. Very good wine list as well, but unfortunately it was substantially overpriced.
Pros:  service, view and interior decor.  Cons:  food and price.   We asked for a salad, which was just OK.   For the rest, we went with chef recommend items.  The lobster curry which was bland and lobster was tasteless.  The $70 steak, which was also just OK.  It is definitely not worth your money.
The best place in Las Vegas that you can get good music combined with best view of Las Vegas strip... . This is my place to go drink and enjoy the view
Mix is fantastic.  The best dining experience we had this trip to Vegas was at Mix by far.  The service was fantastic, our waiter was attentive, quick and didn't mind a little chat since it was a little slower the night we went.  The food was amazing, really tasty, perfect portion size, and not too slow.  The view was spectacular.  Ask for the balcony/patio if you can, you won't regret it.. . I only had one minor quibble.  We were dining on Halloween and I emailed the restaurant to ask if it would be alright if we showed up in costume.  They indicated that would not be allowed so we arranged to get dressed up after dinner instead.  When we got there, tons of people in costume were in the restaurant.  That was disappointing. . . Overall, I would go back in a second.
Items Selected:. Double Espresso over Ice. XXL Rum Baba - Monte-Carlo style. Profiteroles - Vanilla Ice Cream, Warm Homemade Chocolate Sauce. Chocolate Souffle - Pistachio Ice Cream. Warm Madeline - Warm Nutella. . Unable to resist the allure of a three-foot-long Baba Au Rhum, no matter how full from a several course feast at Veranda, it was up the exterior facing glass elevator that myself and two friends ascended to Alain Ducasse's soon to reboot MiX and meeting two more at a ten-top table in the center of a cascade of glass bubbles it was in conversation and desserts that we partook, another double espresso over ice at half the price of the Four Seasons Lavazza proving a perfect accompaniment to the four-plate proceedings.. . Truly one of the most stunning rooms in Las Vegas, with nearly panoramic reviews of the Strip and beyond, it was entry that we saw the object of our desire and admittedly having experienced the dessert several times in the past in locations from New York to London the tableside preparation was slightly less dramatic than that at the others while the choice of rum was a well-culled trio, myself opting for the lightest option while others veered spicy - all with stellar results over the apricot glazed cake with plenty of cream.. . Deciding to also invest in a shared souffle that proved an impeccable display of rich dark chocolate amidst an ethereal base that found much needed levity in a quenelle of pistachio ice cream, it was next in six sliced balls of crispy pate a choux surrounding smooth vanilla that we indulged and topping each one with thick chocolate fudge the third Ducasse classic was perhaps the best version of the dessert I've tasted to date - a compliment of questionably equal applicability to the hot-from-the-pan Madeline, a lightly crisp edge over delicate sponge that was delicious on its own and all the better when dipped in a sidecar of warm hazelnut spread.. . Advertising, to some degree, that the whole three-foot baba would be served at a cost of $12 one rationally assumed that deal was too good to be true, and instead charging $12 per person for what would amount to perhaps a two inch slice the portion was still quite generous considering the version in London goes for about $26 per person - though with far more pomp and circumstance.  Truly a beautiful space it will be interesting to see where the Delano takes Ducasse and "Rivea," but as long as they keep the signatures there is no doubt it is a space worth visiting, even if only for dessert with a view.
Absolutely enjoyed my dinner at the mix. Most romantic setting over looking the vegas strip there champagne,13 year old wine and tasting menu was amazing. Very Nicky done, great tasting and enjoyed how they started us small and slowly the plates got bigger. Strongly recommend.
I just came here for the view but it made enough of an impression that I'd love to come back fro drinks and food. The view is amazing. On par with Ghostbar. Good music, sexy vibe.
We havebeen here 3 times, and the service has been bad every time. The view is AMAZING, but because of the poor service we will not return.
The food was good, but nothing special for the price and Vegas standards.  Our Server (Paul I believe) was pretty much perfect, full of personality and professionalism in one.  However, the reason we picked this place for a romantic dinner was because we had read that the 46th floor view was stunning.  . . 1) the view in the restaurant is NOT nice.  If you want a nice strip view, get appetizers and drinks in the lounge, but do not commit to a full dinner...you won't have a view. . 2) the seating along the window faces away from the window.  Not one person sitting at the window can see out of it without looking away from their dinner date. . 3) everything except for the red water glasses and pink tealight holders is white...EVERYTHING.  The well intended decor would be interesting, but instead it feels slightly like a mental institution with abstract curves and balls of glass hanging from the ceiling while offering nothing stimulating to look at.. . Stick to the lounge.  We had a drink there after and instantly regretted the $300 meal we had in the restaurant with nothing but our waiter's service and personality to make the experience worthwhile
