My 5th time to Vegas and first time staying atPlanet Hollywood. It's a great deal for being in the middle of the strip but the walls are thin and the bathroom vents are connected so you can hear conversations. That was the most negative part of the stay. Maybe if you upgrade to a better room you won't hear your neighbors. Miracle mile shops are convenient and surprisingly not overpriced! Clean room, nice staff, but our room had a lame Speed 2 theme. No luck there! Stay here for an average price and average experience.
Pros:. -Affordable price. -Convenient location on the strip. -Lots of places to eat and shop at Miracle Mile Shops. There are a lot of affordable food options here...Pin-Up Pizza, Earl of Sandwich, Pink's, La Salsa Cantina (breakfast).. -Free wifi (only on two devices). . Cons:. -Self service parking. It is SO far away from the rooms. Way too long of a walk, especially when you are carrying a bunch of bags full of alcohol, water, shoes, etc. Do valet parking instead. Apparently it's free.. -The line to check in was ridiculously long. There should have been more than 3 people working at the front desk on Thanksgiving.. -Pillows are extremely uncomfortable.. -Towels are really thin and not very soft.. . One other thing. We were walking back to the elevators to get to our room around 2am. There was a guy completely passed out, face planted into the floor in the corner. A staff member walked right past him and didn't do anything! He didn't call anyone to help the guy out. He didn't try to wake him up. Horrible! I walked to the lobby and made sure one of the people at the front desk called security. I understand that I'm sure they see this kind of thing a lot with people being drunk and all that. But come on, help the guy out. He's obviously wasted. Get him back to his room. . . I think I would try a different hotel next time I'm in Vegas.
Uh. I was SO looking forward to you, PH, after seeing you in so many movies...but alas, you disappointed! My sister and I go to Vegas once every couple of years. She lives in Baltimore, I live in Boston, so I meet her down in her neck of the woods and after Thanksgiving we get on a plane to Vegas, baby! We've stayed in many hotels here over the years. I heard good things about Planet Hollywood and wanted to give it a try. . . First of all, this place is DARK...even for Vegas. LOTS of dark wood panelling, and the main hotel is definitely beginning to look outdated despite renovations and the tower addition. Maybe my room would be different? Meh. Was it awful? No. Was it anything to write home about? No. It was clean (except the table..there was some type of residue...glass tables in a Vegas hotel room are just ASKING for trouble, if you know what I mean...I can't imagine the things housekeeping has to scrape off after a looonnggg night/morning of partying). My sister's friend met us and she was obviously is a room that had NOT been renovated. Ay yai yai....I would def have asked to move if I were here. Striped walls and a mattress that was lopsided. Looked 20 years too late.. . I'm not sure what it is, but even some of the hotels older than PH have a "newer" feel to them. Something feels kind of grimy about PH...maybe it has to do with all the dark wood panelling, but I can't say I was impressed with anything :(. . I WILL say the location is EXCELLENT and very centralized to the strip- location wise you can't get much better. While I wouldn't *not* stay here if it was heavily discounted/ or someone else was paying for it, I would not stay here again. Just my opinion! Nothing wonderful, but nothing bad. It's Vegas, so you want it to be exciting, which a lot of the other hotels do a good job with.
Horrible!  Dark and feels old.  Many of the staff seemed like they could care less.  We stayed due to our convention being in the hotel and needed to stay near the rest of our group.  After the first night we found bed bugs in our room.  They moved us to a room 5 doors down and had us sign a report saying we saw bed bugs but did nothing to make us feel more comfortable other than that.  We went everywhere else to enjoy Vegas and wish we hadn't stayed there.  Avoid this place if you are looking for more than a scary nights sleep.
We went here to celebrate my son's bday.. I was so excited because last time i checked in here, it was Alladin Hotel and we had a nice suite. room..Unfortunately, planet holkywood is a big disappointment.. rude receptionist, rude front desk.. bathroom sink is clogged and its leaking from underneath, the shower room is clogged.. i slipped and almost fell in the bathroom.. i called the front desk to request if we cam change of room, and he told. me in a flat voice, "not. tonight, only tom during check out time".. no apologies heard.. we called the housekeeping to give us more bathroom. rug for overflowed water.. he is the only person who apologize for inconvenience, he called the maintenance and he came at around 1:30am.. after he drained the water from the shower and bathroom sink, he left it so dirty (yuck!!) i didnt really feel. comfortable after that.. that early morning, i went straight to the receptionist for. change of room.. still the same "no smile, no  word of sorry" not even concerned with the guest complaint..  im never gonna check. in here again.. i go to vegas at least 10x/year.. if you want a really pleasant staff, whollmake you feel at home and comfortable, then dont go in here.. ive been to palazzo, venetian, nobu, trump, hard rock suites, ceasars, aria, wynn and encore.. this hotel by far is the worst ive been
I loved this room! It was a little pricey but overall really nice. I had a bad experience at one of the lounges. Its not the hotels fault but the rooms are nice The beds super comfortable I think I slept more than actually being out lol Thats how good the beds were. I would highly recommend.
Look...the location is a 5 star. Service also a 5 star. Rooms are 3 star. Pretty small rooms. Old bathrooms inside with plastic tubs. The gym is awful and spa from what I saw Im glad we booked our services at the Palms. Price is 5 star. Access to shopping other casinos etc 5 star. My wife had a dress delivered it was $10 bucks to pick it up. I get you gotta make money but come on. Resort fee required and gym sucked. Sorry..i mentioned that. Did I say the gym sucked? Yeah...I know. Look while 3 star honestly..Id stay here again but gym and spa at Mandalay Bay and rooms blows Planet Hollywood away.
I love Planet Hollywood it's my favorite hotel in Vegas ! it is so pretty they have great store and the miracle mile mall is amazing the Mac store there's great upstairs is to die for , the foods really good the shows there or kick ass ! Britney Spears is awesome. All their bars are really cute and the atmosphere is very kid friendly in the mall ! I come to Vegas every year and I go to Planet Hollywood every time I come!(:
I'm definitely a fan of Planet Hollywood, it's right by everything that I came to the trip for. The rooms are awesome, and I loved the bathrooms, shower, and hot tubs. The casino's layout is awesome but the table minimum's are all 15 dollars and above.  The PF changs inside planet Hollywood was really tasty. However I do have one complaint, it was the plumbing and drainage issues in the room. The toilet got flooded at one point and the sink didn't drain and the water was overflowing. Other than that the hotel was very nice and more than I expected.
Was staying at this hotel and the security completely refused to be reasonable and evicted us without offering to relocate when we got noise complaints. I was in a suite with a stripper pole in the shower. What kind of room has a stripper pole in it that isn't expected to be loud? Never going back. Stupid.
Planet Hollywood is a nice place except for one reason! . The gym & spa closes at 7pm!!! Wtf???. I also brought my little brother who's 14 years old to the gym and this FAT lady at the desk said NO he's under age... . That's why I call this place Planet Fattty and that's why she looks the way she does because she never believed in children's health & fitness... She believes in Fatness :(
Very inexpensive. Planet Hollywood has everything you need. From gambling, to Chipotle :) to a good selection of stores to shop from.. . Great room service.
Lots of fun things to do at Planet Hollywood!. . This property is great because of its location and all the fun things inside of it! From the mall with so many great stores & restaurants to all the different shows, the central location, the clean casino & nice rooms this property is great all the way around. . . There's also tons of parking spaces & it's convenient to get in & out of. . . If you're checking in it's worth upgrading to a strip view because you'll see the amazing Bellagio fountains!
Fun & Upbeat!  But the sales persons all outside along the building are not only annoying but makes you not wanna go back after the first visit to avoid all the bothersome sale pitches, being cornered and approached.  . . Tons of HOES in the wee hours or once the sun goes down. Definitely not kid friendly in my opinion. Good slotss, talked and super nice staff waking all around. . . But it's Vegas I expected some of this crap and im cool with it.  Just my opinion. . . Chow
Perfect location, which is super important!!! Spacious room. Cheap price if you avoid the busy season. Nice shopping mall with most of the stuff you would need to buy.. . A little complaint, I stayed for 4 days, for the first three days no one cleaned the room, changed the towel, etc. etc. Also the room is outdated.
This would have been a 4 star review until the 90 minute wait at the valet. I get it, it's check out time but to have only 6 valet on service is poor management and bad customer service especially at the end of a great stay. I won't come back for this fact alone.
Worst experience ever!!! Paid for a 2 Queen room and they gave me a 1 King room, they expect me to share a bed with another guy or not sleep at all. They don't have an extra bed either, they gave me a room that I don't want and charge me extra!!!
BEWARE!!!!!!!. . Stayed at Planet Hollywood Resort and their staff STOLE a pair of expensive pair boots while my wife was taken to emergency due to illness!!!
GREAT location in middle of strip cool casino/restaurants. . OUR room was NOT CLEAN!!!! dusty as hell. there was pills on the floors from previous guest... how hard is it to vacuum? sink was clogged. . . self parking is HORRIBLE be aware if u drive n park, you have to walk through the miracle mile mall after you fight for parking. the walk itself prob take up to 10 minutes sucks if you are in a rush... way better options in terms of rooms to stay in.
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #29:. this place is sensory overload to the fullest; high ceilings with lots of colors & lights; pumping music, and sexy go-go dancers gyrating on stages all around the gaming tables; though it's not that big, it's easy to get lost in here; the hotel check-in is downstairs, and upstairs is a more serene floor of multiple small theaters (including a comedy club), a red & black themed conference room area, a cool mini wedding chapel, and a couple of higher-end restaurants; very much integrated with the surrounding Miracle Mile shops, which offer fun & affordable shopping; several good cheap eats options (Earl of Sandwich, Meatball Spot, Pink's Hot Dogs); and Britney Spears is still pulling the hordes in at the main theater; best craft beer bet = Sin City Brewing has an outpost in the shops area; Gordon Ramsay's burger place is OK for beer; and there is an ABC variety store that has a solid selection of 22 oz. bombers (including many by Rogue Brewing) for only $8
If I could give zero stars I would. Waiting in line an hour to check-in?! (Maybe longer-still here!)Really? Figure it out. Will never oil here again.
Great location, ok rooms, ok restaurants. Horrible staff. I felt like i was inconveniencing them by asking for simple directions. Incredibly rude and everyone looked like they were miserable. Probably the worst part of my experience was the Spa. Please avoid this hell hole even if they offer it to you for free! It is incredibly dirty and smells. I couldnt take more then 20 min and i left to take a long shower in my room. Try calling the front desk and youll wait anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes every time. There are SO many better hotels on the strip around the same price. I will not be staying here again!
Stayed here for three nights. One of the better rooms we've had on the strip. It's a well kept and nice hotel. The only drawback is the cable/satellite cots in and out quite frequently which is annoying.
