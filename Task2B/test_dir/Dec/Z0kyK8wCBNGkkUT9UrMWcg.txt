Usually I don't write about service or decor or anything not food related because it really should be about the food. I have to make an exception for this place because they go above AND beyond to satisfy customers.. . Ordered their special Wagyu beef and thought it was gamey near the bone areas. Server replaced my order immediately with no questions asked and put food on my table within 10 mins. The manager came out to apologize and made sure I was happy THEN sends me a card in the mail afterwards. . . The steak itself was 4 stars (very good but not stellar) but the service made this place an easy 5 star.
After the last manager that hadn't called me back, another manager had called to tell me that they were undergoing management changes and they had apologized for my last visit and requested that I'd give them a second chance.. . I finally made my second visit a year later and this time, I was pleasantly pleased with their service and their food. Our waiter introduced the specials including each dish's price, which our last server neglected to do. Our server also warned us that they tend to undercook their steaks and made recommendations how our steaks should be prepared. We took his advice and went with medium for their double eagle bone in steak and that did not disappoint! When our food came, they were all served on hot plates and since I was sharing my steak, they brought out an extra hot plate for me. I hadn't noticed the hot plate during my first visit so this may be new. I was very delighted that this kept my food hot for a while, just the way I like it. We had also tried their lobster mac and cheese, which is mind blowingly good! Please get this as your side! You will be in heaven, I guarantee it! . . All in all, I'm very happy with my second visit and I will return in the future!
I went to this steak house for my birthday last month. For appetizer, we ordered fresh oyster, it's pretty good esp the sauce. For the main dish, I ordered the bone in ribeye 22oz, it's really good and the flavor so perfect. I was asking medium for my steak, and it's perfect with the pink inside. The waitress asked me to cut the steak to check if the steak was cooked okay. We ordered lobster mac and cheese, it was alright or maybe I am not a big fan of Mac and cheese lol but my boyfriend said it was okay too. It was over rated. Other than those, we ordered side order mushrooms and corn, I love it.. . . The service was pretty good!! I highly recommend it if you are craving for steak :)
I've had my fair share of steakhouses in Vegas and Del Frisco's rises to the top of the list. I like that it's not part of a casino that houses a steakhouse with marked up prices just to bring in the cash. That isn't to say that the prices are cheap, because they aren't, but Del Frisco's knows how to cook a steak. I came with my group of friends who were visiting for my friend's 30th birthday. The majority of us ended up ordering the $55 Sunday Prime Pair, which was a surf & turf of sorts, pairing an 8 oz. filet with a seafood option.. . I started with the Del's salad, which had two big crispy strips of bacon to go along with salad topped with an avocado Caesar dressing. Next, I opted for the filet paired with the lemon-garlic scallops and fried capers. This piece of filet was one of the best, if not, the best cooked piece of steak I've ever had. When you say medium-rare, they actually cook it perfectly through and through. It was red and hot in the center and tender beyond belief. I enjoyed the scallops and the signature crab cake I tried was good too. But the focus was all on the filet. For sides, we shared the spinach supreme, chateau potatoes, baked potato, and maque choux corn. The portions were big enough for everyone to share each other's sides. My favorite was split between the spinach and the corn. Unless, you count the lobster mac 'n cheese as a side, which we also ordered. One order was more than enough to share between 7 people, but we went ahead and got a second for good measure. They don't skimp out on the lobster either. By some mix-up, we also ended up with truffle butter for our steaks. Yes, it was that extravagant.. . The meal ended with a delicious pecan cheesecake topped with caramel. Many steakhouses have the same menu with similar salads, sides, and seafood. But, Del Frisco's just does it a little bit better. It's easy to drop more than a bill here, but remember what to order: the filet, lobster mac 'n cheese, maybe the spinach supreme. You will be set.
Went last night for the first time as part of a group of 11 guys.  We were seated in a private dining room next to the wine cellar - very cool!. . We went all out by ordering crab cakes and king crab appetizers - delicious.  Then everybody ordered their entrees and we picked three sides: lobster mac n cheese, asparagus and creamed spinach to share.  I had the 8 oz filet.  All the sides arrived piping hot and were served to us on the sizzling dinner plate that the steak was served on.  Interesting that as your steak was served they asked that you cut into it right through the middle to ensure that the doneness was as you ordered -  I never experienced that at a steak house.  Of course mine was cooked to specification at medium rare, appeared to be simply seasoned with salt/pepper and the meat was a wet aged prime cut that was as tender as it was flavorful.  We enjoyed Prisoner wine that complimented our meal wonderfully and the wine service was expert with the wine properly decanted and served from carafe.  Anxious to return for another meal here with my wife......the vibe in the bar with a piano player vocalist was good energy.
Overrated and likely living on it's reputation.. . My wife and I were excited to dine at the "legendary" Double Eagle, we'd heard so much about the place. Sadly that didn't happen and likely will not. We arrived a little early for our reservation only to turn around within a few minutes of looking over the interior and left for a competing steakhouse in a nearby casino. We were so underwhelmed, the interior seemed dingy, somewhat noisy and not anywhere near as welcoming and comfortable as you'd expect a highly rated steakhouse to be. The worst part about this experience is that it began before we opened the door, the valet didn't say a word to us and as we approached the main door a strong sewage smell assaulted the senses. Not what one wants to smell when heading in for a bite to eat.. . Because we left, clearly we did not dine so I cannot say much about the food other than we've had the opportunity to dine a couple of times at a Del Frisco's near us in Southern California and food there has been consistently excellent and the service quite good. Hopefully the Double Eagle was just having a bad day but sadly it left a lasting poor impression with us and it's likely we won't return.
My friend and everyone else in the Yelp world talks about this place and they are right; it is pretty good.. . However, I have been ruined by Mastro's in the steakhouse segment. Anything and everything that isn't Mastro's is hard to impress me. . . Service: our server was great! Super nice and attentive. He did try to upsell us a lot of things but it's part of his job but it was a bit much. . . Bread: sesame bread loaf. Simple. Plain. Good thought. Hot. Fluffy... But plain for this type of place. . . Salad: Caesar Salad is amazing. The dressing is garlicky but super good. We also had their house special chopped salad with a basil dressing and avocado and shredded cheese. Amazing! . . Steak: Got the filet trip that came Bruno style with scallops, Oscar style with crab, and a filet with a slice of Brie. Scallop wasn't seared well. It was plain. Almost undercooked. The black truffle oil was super delicious! Crab was good. . . Sides: lobster Mac and cheese. AMAZING. SUPER GOOD. SUPER CREAMY! amazing! Sweet yams.... Are you serious?!?!? These are so GOOOOODDD!!! . . Overall, it was good. But like I said I'm ruined for life.
What canI say, this is the 3rd time we ate at Del Friscos and We've never been disappointed. In fact have to sday its the best steak and lobster tail I have ever had. Service is impeccable, fast, courteous and atmosphere is excellent at the one in Las Vegas. I have also been to Orlando's Del Friscos, which is also awesome, more of a mobster feel there... Its a but p[pricey but everything of this high quality in Vegas is and you cant go wrong. My Rib Eye was cooked to perfection and the sides are to die for! Keep in mind, sides are al-a-cart.  5 stars again!
This place is right there with Morton's,Smith & Wollensky, Ruth Chris,Mastro's and any other comparable great American steakhouse....... easily on a par with all of them . Great server Richie ( formerly worked at Gibson's in Chicago another excellent steakhouse )...... gave us excellent recommendations for appetizers,wine and sides...... everything here was GREAT ........ its one of those places that you will look forward to returning to ......
If you like mediocre food, slow service (like really, really slow), and indifferent food servers, then this is the place for you.  Oh, did I mention they are also way over-priced?
