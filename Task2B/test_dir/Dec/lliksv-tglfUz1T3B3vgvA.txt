The food at Lotus of Siam is so incredibly full of flavor and spice. You know that feeling when something's so spicy it's burning your mouth and you KNOW it's bad for you, but the food is too delicious to stop eating? My nose was in a constant state of runny but I ate so much I could barely make it to my show afterwards.. . p.s. - There was a second Lotus of Siam that opened in NYC years ago, but it fell sorely short of expectations after having tried the original.
Went back a second time the night before Thanksgiving.  Continues to provide a wonderful experience for your taste buds.  Order the northern cuisine people!  Every trip to Vegas will include a trip to LoS for us.
Great Thai in the desert
My visit to Lotus of Siam last night was great, so I'm upping my stars to 4. Other than the hefty price tag for tiny portions, this place ROCKS.  Last night we went with a group of 8 and the service was just as great as my first visit. My boyfriend and I shared the crispy duck with drunken noodles and also the beef larb. Both dishes were just amazing and cooked to perfection. However, last time I ordered spiciness with a 3 and it was a tad bit too spicy, so this time I ordered with a 2 and there was no spice at all, lol. I think it's just a Thai thing and it depends on who's cooking that day. Either way, the food was excellent!
BUZZ. - Garlic Prawns (4/10). - Drunken Noodles. . I ALSO TRIED. - Tom Kha Kai w Chicken (5/10). - Penang Curry w Beef (4/10). . First off, I haven't written a review in a really long time! I love the fact that I travel a decent amount for work, so I get to try a lot of new places and write reviews. Ironically, it's because of that travel that I haven't been able to write any reviews lately. I've had so many jam-packed 1-day travels that, I might check in to a hotel on Yelp, but I'll knock out about 20 seconds after, then wake up, shower, and leave - all while still kinda sleeping. Even meals have been rushed. The business dinners might be in nice restaurants, but we're having such fierce conversations about work, that the food might as well have just teleported into our stomachs without ever being tasted.. . OK, now that that's out of the way, a little history. Pad Thai used to be what I thought Thai food was. Yes, I know that it IS Thai food, but I mean I thought that was all Thai food was! In 2007, I had Lotus of Siam and we ordered all sort of things and it was amazing. Since then, I discovered more facets of Thai food, namely Tom Kha and Penang Curry. Ever since I tried those, I've been dying to try them at Lotus, because this is touted by some as the best Thai restaurant on the planet!. . TOM KHA KAI. Server asked how spicy I wanted it, and then said "on a scale of 1-10." I was taken aback, because that's a really wide range! Even though I normally order "Extra Spicy" at other Thai places, the numbers intimidated me a bit, so I just said 8.. . It tasted fine, but it didn't have anything in there that would make it taste great. No landmines, so that's good. The chicken was seasoned enough, but dry. The Tom Kha (and maybe this is just the style) was missing the tiny bit of sweetness that I've come to like and expect. As for spice, the first spoonful, I thought I got duped, but then after about 3 more spoons, the heat started to rise! Not enough for me to grab water, but enough where taking bites of the hot garlic prawns were painful on the tongue. It really seemed like that if you just had the soup, the 8 would actually be like a 6, but I think the higher the number, the more pepper bits are in the soup, so you just have a higher chance of picking one up, and those peppers themselves pack a punch!. . PENANG CURRY. Sigh. It's missing that almost nutty flavor that I've come to like, and it was a little too ginger-y/lemongrassy than I like. Consistency was about as much as condensed milk, and a spice level of 8, tasted more like a 4. The beef didn't really lend any helpful flavors, but hey, at least it was protein! Not the worst I've ever had, but I'm just really disappointed, considering how many people have this as their favorite Thai restaurant. Then again, it could just be different styles, which I admittedly don't know much about.. . GARLIC PRAWNS. I remember when I was little, a friend of mine used to eat the shrimp tail. I was mesmerized! I had never even tried it before. So, I fearlessly started trying to eat the tail, and I was almost to the point of gagging. Fast forward 25 years and here I am at Lotus of Siam. . . The shrimp comes out looking like the letter w. The left "u" is the shrimp, the right "u" is the shell of the shrimp, both still connected at the tail. The whole thing has been seasoned and deep fried. Now, I've had Japanese sweet shrimp before, where they fry the heads, and it was better than eating that shrimp tail many years ago, but I couldn't eat more than 1. These were definitely better, but it took a lot of mental psyching and determination to eat several. . . The shrimp is good. The shell is actually pretty tasty. Out of all the fried shrimp shell I've had, this was the best. It was more crunchy/crispy than any other one I've had by far. And it had a buttery flavor to it that helped take my mind off of the shell. For me, if I took a bite of shrimp and a bite of shell, that was a tumultuous bite, and I had to fight the urge to spit it out. The trick was to eat the shell by itself, like it was one big shrimp chip. The other thing was to keep my mouth dry. Once I took the bite, I had to keep saliva away (sorry to get so technical here) and definitely resist the urge to "wash it down." When the shell was dry and crispy, it shattered easier, which meant that it ground down finely so it was easy to swallow...like a chip. As soon as moisture was introduced, the shell no longer wanted to shatter, instead it would just flex, which meant that when you swallowed, it was that rough shell-like texture that made me want to gag. . . So all in all, happy I tried it, but perfectly fine with never trying it again.. . LOTUS OF DISAPPOINTMENT. I can't tell you how disappointed I was with the curry and soup. I've been waiting at least 4 years to have an opportunity to come to Vegas to try these dishes, and it didn't deliver. It's not to say this place isn't good. I have had great meals here, but they're not good at my fav.dishs
Softest pad see ew noodles I've ever had. That's weird but if you have theirs you'll understand... . You spend about $3 more on your fav Thai dishes but it really is all so delicious!
Lotus of Siam is really good Thai food.  It is clearly not in the world's best location, but you are going to Lotus for the food, not the massage parlor next door.  The menu is quite elaborate, and there are some unique items.  I typically ask the waiter for his recommendations and go with them. . . The recommendations were all good, but I think that they recommend the same stuff to everyone.  I told him that we were adventurous, but he basically recommended the same stuff.  Jumbo Prawns (so-so), Crispy Duck (good sauce), some coconut milk dish with noodles (bland), Drunken Noodles with Sea Bass (great noodles), and pork satay (yum).. . The main thing that I would have changed with my order was to make things more spicy. I'm a big spicy guy, but this was pretty mellow.  I am confused why he did not ask us the level of spiciness that we wanted.. . Overall, this is probably one of the better Thai restaurants in Vegas (and most likely Nevada).  If you are in town, its worth the journey to the north side of the strip to check it out.
Hard to catch a cab ride back but soooooooo worth it! Crispy Duke Panang a must and the Garlic Shrimp is crispy and sauteed perfectly with Thai chillies and minced garlic. Safe to say the best Thai food I've ever had. Sorry Mom!
Talk about a "don't judge a book by its cover" restaurant.  Had a party of 12 and lucky to have the reservation.  This Thai food is even better than some of the Thai I have had in Southeast Asia.  Must have!!!  Try a little of everything!
Wow, was Lotus of Siam excellent! Wonderful service, the most extensive list of German wines I've seen outside of Germany (and what could go better with Thai food than German wine?) and outstanding food, the best Thai I've ever had. The northern Thai sausage was my favorite item, followed closely by the eggplant and mushroom appetizer. Lots of complex flavors expertly developed. My thanks to Anthony Bourdain for the recommendation.
Vegas has been 2 for 2 for me as far as venturing away from Buffets!. . Lotus of Siam did not disappoint, the service was great and attentive.  We got our food FAST!! Seriously, probably within 10 minutes of ordering.. . Our list of plates included : prawns, duck w/ panang sauce, sausage, chicken wings and drunken noodles... everything was so amazing! The prawn was so finger licking good that I can probably just eat the shells all day long!  The sausage was flavorful and the wings were crisp!!!  What stood out the most however, was the duck with panang sauce, that was perfection a definitely must try!!! TENDER, FLAVORFUL and full of character. . I will definitely be back next time I'm here in Vegas!! :D
Everything we had here was perfect. We had the crispy spicy chicken wings, the best Tom Kha soup I   have ever had, drunken noodles that were perfect and the best pad Thai.
Unbelievably tasty Thai food. Enormous menu which makes choosing just a few dishes extremely difficult. Lots of seating, always busy, food absolutely flies out of the kitchen in no time. Service was very friendly and professional. I go to Vegas a lot and will reserve for dinner every time I'm in town going forward. It lives up to the hype.
I was so excited to finally go to the famous Lotus of Siam...... I had looked at the yelp reviews and planned my dinner ahead..... . First was the Dassai sake! The big bottle of course! . . The food: . Garlic Prawns...... The star of the show! This one is definitely all it is cracked up to be! If you go to Lotus of Siam, you MUST get the Garlic Prawns! I will come back for the prawns alone!. . Crispy Duck with Basil....... Delicious! Really good quality duck cooked perfectly, with a wonderful basil sauce that accented the dish without overwhelming the flavor of the duck!!!. . Crying Tiger.... I do have to say that though the flavors were good, the steak was over cooked! It was medium well almost well done.... we didn't finish the steak or take it home..... this one was disappointing!. . Drunken Noodles with chicken.... good... not great... flavors were good, but I ordered spicy 5 thinking this is my first time here and 5 would be spicy but safe.... no... not spicy at all... and for me, I need some spice with my thai noodles!. . All around though, it was very good! Service is great! I will def be back!
We got the jackfruit curry and the catfish curry. The jackfruit didn't have any flavor, but that may be due to the fruit being cooked with the curry too long. Br catfish curry was cooked well. We also got wontons and dumplings. Those were excellent.
This is such a phenomenal place! My cousin brought me and my boyfriend here when we were visiting Vegas from the east coast.  It's located in a quiet shopping center, I couldn't believe how busy the restaurant was until I stepped inside.   . So we got their famous garlic prawns - definitely remarkable, so flavorful and perfectly cooked, you can't get this anywhere else!   The crispy duck with penang curry was so good - the duck meat was tender with crispy skin in the flavorful penang sauce.   Pad thai was the best pad thai I've ever had.  . This place gets really busy even on week nights, make sure to call for reservation.. I wish I could have stayed in Vegas for longer and come back a few more times to try other dishes on their menu.  I'll definitely return when I come to Vegas next time!
This place is authentic and good. Price is similar to other Thai Restaurants. On a few items they are more expensive. Portions are small.
Simply put, they live up to the hype, and deserve the accolades.. . The famous garlic prawns definitely left a favorable, long standing impression on their food, so much so that even though we have to pay $15 for delivery, we order their food through the Postmates iPhone app.. . Combination fired rice, yum woon sen were also great. We want to explore other items in the future, but the garlic prawns will always be a roadblock for our small-ish appetite. But I can't complain when something is too good to skip.
We were somewhat disappointed as we had hoped for a better experience. In a nutshell, the food was good but the service lacking. I had the Tom Kah Kai soup which unfortunately arrived lukewarm. Then came my Penang Curry with Tofu which was very good. Unfortunately my wife had to wait for her Seared Scallops with cabbage for quite a while and consequently her rice was cold. She enjoyed the Scallops but........food good but not outstanding and the service was questionable.
It may not look like much from the outside, but the inside is nice. The food is great and the staff are friendly. Their pad thai is incredible (which is an understatement). The Khao Soi is also very good. To top it off, its hard to beat the price. My only hesitation is that I have not eaten at too many thai restaurants and so maybe there is something better out there.
I was in Vegas for a Fantasy Football tournament and I wanted to try a nationally renowned eatery known as Lotus of Siam. It had so many great reviews and accolades that I felt we couldn't lose. But similar to my Blackjack experiences, the house won. I frankly was underwhelmed. I am a Thai food aficionado and have experienced some amazing Thai cuisine in Atlanta and Houston. I was betting that Vegas would blow them all out of the water; er desert, but that didn't happen. The group I brought with me were somewhat new to Thai food so they were blown away with how good it was. . The service was 5 stars and the wine list lived up to their wall full of Wine Spectator awards. . The Tom Kha Kai soup was nothing special. The stuffed chicken wings left me yawning and the Pad Thai was decent but didn't move me to tears.. I have heard that it can be very difficult to get reservations here but we had no problem Sunday night.. I really don't feel this place is that special or worth the 15 minute cab ride from the strip.
I was very happy to have finally had the chance to try this place, especially with such raving reviews and scrumptious pictures. My husband and I came at a perfect timing, no lines. I could not wait to taste the popular ones: Nam prik ong (red chili dip), garlic prawns, crispy duck with panang and nua nom tok (beef dish). I feel bad to say this....everything was great except the food. They were okay....not as great as a lot of the reviews were saying. I expected food that would just blow my palate away and forever etched in my memory, but unfortunately that was not the case. This place is also overpriced for the food you are getting.
Stopped by for a dinner on a recent trip.  This place used to be a hidden gem off strip, but with all of the press and great reviews, you probably want to get a reservation for dinner even on what seems like a quiet, midweek night.. . I had the red curry for my entree, spice level 8 (out of 10).  This is the only Thai place I know not to order their spiciest in the country.  The curry is more of a sou type rather than a stew style of curry.  sampling the broth, I did't notice the spice, but when you get the veggies and the meat, THERE is the spice!. . Found the service to be very attentive, food to be top notch.  If you are used to the vegas buffets and monster plates of food you can find other places around (like Hash House A Go-Go), you might be disappointed in the serving size, this is more of a healthy for you meal
Don't believe the hype people. Los Angeles has way better Thai Food.  The food isn't bad just way over hyped.  Also the worse service ever.  Waited over 40 minutes on two separate occasions for our orders when they told us it'd be 20 minutes.
This a Vegas must go. Every time we come to Vegas, we come here. . . Make reservations! Or else you will be waiting forever. . . The location is sketchy but the food is good. . . Highlights: . -Thai Iced Tea. -Garlic Prawns. -Nua Katiem (Beef with garlic... Sounds so simple but so amazing) . -Raw Prawns (not for the faint hearted. This is raw shrimp but sauce) it's so good . -Crispy Catfish Salad. Sooooooo good!
Good food, not sure about the "best". We had the pad thai, the #55 with beef, and coconut egg noddle soup. Everything had good flavor and service was excellent. Would return here on next trip to Vegas.
One of the best Thai Places out there, there are only 3 steps you need to follow.. . Step 1. Order Garlic Prawns. Step 2. Order Roast Duck Curry. Step 3. Eat and Repeat.. . Everything else is also really incredible, but the Garlic Prawn and Roast Duck Curry are just so spectacular.
Good food but can be pricey with small portions. Busy so hard to get service and tends to be a wait. I would pass on the Tom yum soup, but everything else we had was good (garlic prawns, sea bass drunken noodles, pad Thai, boat noodle, nam kao tod, fried banana with coconut ice cream). Seafood options usually over $20 and everything else we had was around $10.
The crispy duck panang is just amazing. The reviews, just like the flavors of this restaurant's food, is right on point. A bit pricey imo but glad I tried it. Also ordered the pad see ew which was so flavorful. Service was great too.
This is my 3rd visit here, TBH...it went down hill. All the dishes are extremely spicy, I meant EXTREMELY, almost uneatable and portions are too small. Well, I guess ...this is how they want to make money. Tom yum gain is too sour and cold, papaya salad is barely any, Thai BBQ chicken charged for whole chicken but only tiny little pieces like quail size. Good bye Lotus of siam, you're out of my lead.
Tried out Lotus of Siam because it had good reviews on CH and Yelp plus it was on Anthony Bourdain's Parts Unknown Vegas show that we just watched before coming here.. . Maybe reservations by phone a few weeks before coming here.  That was easy to do.  Ask them for the cross street, because if you have a dinner reservation it's hard to find the place!. . Everyone says to get the Northern Thai dishes at LOS.  So we tried a few things:. . Khao Soi $10.95 - egg noodle curry soup.  We thought it was just ok, nothing special.. Some red onions, pickles, lime on the side.. . Kang Hung Lay $10.95 - red pork curry.  It was a small dish of just pork and curry sauce w/ some cilantro on top.  Tasted just ok, nothing special.. . Northern Tom Kah Soup $10.95 - a bit spicy and sour without coconut milk soup, chicken is dry, some grape tomatoes flavorless, some mushroom, meh.. . Sticky rice $2 - for 1 person, meh, dry.. . Thai ice tea $2.5 - very sweet!  Had to dilute it with lots of water & ice.. . Hot tea $2 - some container of hot tea w/ tea bag, nothing special.. . Glad I tried it, but probably won't go back.
Food wasgood . Less option on the vegetarian dishes (no meat). We had ordered fried tofu , vegetable spicy soup and vegetable fried rice. All the dishes were moderate.
Food was to die for. Great seevice. Definitely did not expect it to be so nice in such a run down pavillion and a not so great area of town.
Despite my attempts, I have not eaten here. I can, however, comment on the service I'm sure I would receive if I did. I called about four-five times to make a reservation or talk about the possibility of eating there over the next few days. First, I was deliberately hung up on twice--as in someone picked up the phone, I heard talking in the background, and then I heard them hang up for no reason. Then I finally spoke to a woman who apparently hates being customer-facing. She told me they're too busy for reservations over the next few days at any time (reasonable, I know they're very popular), but also that I "really shouldn't bother coming in because it'd be around two hours to wait" (at any given time within a 72-hour period, apparently). Shouldn't I make the decision on whether to wait? . . Suffice it to say I have no interest in ever eating at this establishment. It doesn't ever matter how good the food is when the service is this bad.
The more I come here the more I love this place!! I love the garlic spawns and the soft shell crab is delious! My must stop everytime I come to vegas!
This Thai restaurant is ranked among the highest in Las Vegas with so may awards hanging on the walls. I tried the food and it was good, but I have tasted better Thai food at few other smaller restaurants in Los Angeles. In my opinion, the reason that this restaurant has received so many awards is because this restaurant by far serves the most extensive menu. I don't rink there is any food left in Thailand that is not served at this restaurant. . Still, I expect this restaurant to serve a better Thai ice tea than serving a ready made one bought in the market. . I relatively eat spicy food in other restaurants, but I can't handle any Thai food with spice level rated more than 3, while they serve food up to spice level of 9. The spice numbering system is very tricky and the servers need to warn the novice customers when they order the spice level of the food higher than three.
Lotus is a breath of fresh air in a sea of over-hyped, over-priced pretentious restaurants here in Las Vegas.. . The ingredients are fresh and appropriate to the style.  Dishes are properly prepared and done quickly given the fact that the restaurant is always crowded.  They will adjust the level of "heat" to your liking to the best of their ability although some dishes have no choice but to be somewhat spicy due to the pre-prepared sauces used in their preparation. . . They also have a remarkable wine list for a restaurant of this genre.  There are several Grand Cru Bordeaux choices with a range of vintages as well as all the usual suspects.  But, it IS Las Vegas :D. . Yes, you have to plan ahead if you want to eat here.  People begin lining up out front more than half an hour befor opening time so don't be surprised if you're told an hour or longer for a walk-in.  Even though it is located in a decrepit strip mall you otherwise wouldn't give a second glance, everyone knows how good the food is and acts accordingly.
I don't think I have EVER been to a Thai restaurant as good as this one. It was TOTALLY worth the two hour wait to be seated and the two years it took me to get there. While waiting, many of the regulars (many who come in from out of town) advised us what to order and we looked at the extensive 15 page menu.. . Tom Kah Kai soup was exquisite. The first thing that hits you is the great aroma. It had layers of flavors-sweet, salty, with a taste of lime and coconut all with a bit of spice throughout. The white meat chicken was thinly sliced and tender and mushrooms that were firm but not overcooked.. . Woon Sen soup (Bankok style) was delicious. The first thing noticed was how it was seasoned with the right amount of salt. The Napa cabbage was cooked perfectly, crunchy but not raw as were the cellophane noodles. The black mushrooms and chicken only enhanced it.. . The garlic prawns is one of the most popular items on the menu. Now, I know why. The prawns are deep fried with the shell on and topped with black pepper, having a potato chip texture with a bite. Then, there's the garlic that tasted like it was infused throughout each prawn. This is something that I'd definitely order again.. . Crispy duck on drunken noodles was the favorite dish ordered. I was surprised at how crispy the duck actually was, being that it was covered by the sauce of the noodles. The meat itself was moist and flavorful and not greasy like most duck I've ordered from other restaurants in the past. It was placed on a bed of flat noodles that was swimming and over saturated in a sauce, hence the name drunken. The sauce was salty with a sweet and sour aspect in it and a mild spiciness.. . Lotus of Siam has won award after award every year since 2008 and it's an experience that shouldn't be missed if you are anywhere near Las Vegas.
My family and I was craving some thai food on our first night in Vegas and we stopped by here before checking into our hotel room. It's located in a strip mall on Sahara. The restaurant was surprisingly big and we got seated fairly quickly. The food was what really let me down. We ordered the shrimp tom yum soup (hot pot size), crab fried rice, thai papaya salad and beef pad se-ew. All dishes came out very petite and not meant for sharing. I would not recommend any of the dishes I ordered. The best dish was the crab fried rice. For the amount of food provided, the prices were high. I will not be coming back...not sure how this place got an average of 4 stars.
Who knew I would have a compelling reason to go to Vegas just to get Thai food, something that I could literally find every few blocks where I live.. . But before you get excited to visit this place, you'll have to find it. You really can't see the restaurant from the street, but once you turn into a plaza and notice a huge empty parking lot, you are definitely getting warmer. . . I went with a lot of choices as advised by yelpers- the prawns with drunken noodles, the crispy duck in panang curry (it's been weeks since I've been butthe name has stuck with me) and the last was a beef dish that I don't quite remember the name. The prawns were gigantic and cooked with such a nice crunch to them. The noodles that comes with it is a perfect accompaniment, even with your white rice! I also loved loved loved the duck. Great crunch on the skin and the curry had a reasonable kick to it- loaded with flavor. Both of these dishes I would no doubt get again. The beef dish- while the beef was cooked nicely was not a favorite of mine. It was doused in something that resembled BBQ sauce that I wasn't a huge fan of (and notice how I said doused, they probably put too much on the meat).. . All in all, it was a delicious meal. It is on the pricier side for lunch but, I personally think it is worth every penny. Don't be shy and ask for more rice if you need something to soak up all that curry. Truly a 5 star for me!
food tasty. inside decor outdated and feels dirty. garlic prawns was the best. duck curry was good
The hubs was right ~ the best Thai food ever.  . . The restaurant is unassuming from the outside, but once you step in the doors, a nice wine cellar is the backdrop for the hustle and bustle of a wonderful establishment.  . . Friendly service.  Super flavorful dishes and moist, tender meats.  . . We ordered: . - Crispy Rice appetizer - spicy and sour.  Puckering.  Party in my mouth.. - Beef Salad - tender beef slices on tasty greens. - Chicken Skewers - so dainty and tender.  Not your average chicken skewer.. - Duck Curry - tender and lightly crisp duck pieces over noodles with curry.  Star of the show.. . All delicious.  Very, very good.. . Thanks, Lotus of Siam ~ you guys rock!

Notable recommendations would be the soft shell crab pad kee mao (drunken noodles), the crispy garlic prawns appetizer (fried shrimp shells are edible and yummy), nam khao tod (a Lao dish with sour pork and crispy rice). There are curries, massaman, Lao dishes, Issan province dishes, and more. Wine selection focuses on Riesling, which range from $20-65 per bottle.
Was intrigued by the good reviews and that it has been featured on Anthony Bourdain's show! Let me state that this restaurant gets pack, so call in for reservation if possible, even on a weekday. We ordered four different dishes; chicken pad Thai, chicken dumplings, crispy fried garlic prawns and spicy chicken soup(M) all were small portions but tasted tremendous. The star of the show was the crispy fried garlic prawns. That dish alone is well worth the trip to this restaurant. Definitely a must for my next Vegas trip!!!!!!!!
everything was really good. the garlic prawns, . duck, . pad thai, . and wonton soup are things i would recommend.. . there was a long wait (about an hour), so i would suggest making a reservation.
The new slimmed down restaurant is fairly small but lovely. The Swedish Meatballs and gravlax are stellar. The service is tremendously improved since my last visit. Stellar service. Looking around the room, I felt I was in Scandinavia. It was a great trip.
This place use to be good.  I'm not sure what happened to their food and portions.   Somehow the food became bland and their portions are a lot smaller.   We had to order more than usual to accommodate the five of us and we still left hungry.   So disappointing.   I don't think we will be coming back here anymore.
