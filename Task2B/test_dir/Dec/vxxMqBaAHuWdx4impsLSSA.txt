2.5 stars. . The food always looks so good here, so they get an A for presentation. However, the food is never as good as it looks, which is really disappointing.. . I always seem to come back here, although my visits are never fully satisfying. I like the enormous variety of food that they offer and drinks. However, during my last visit on Christmas Eve, I was pretty disappointed.. . The cost was around $35-40 for both brunch and dinner due to the holiday. There was no line outside, so we got seated right away. I ordered a cranberry juice and got an orange juice. I would have complained if the orange juice didn't taste good, but it was really good, so I left it alone. . . Nothing really stood out to me aside from the orange juice. Everything was just ok or subpar. I don't know if I I'll come back during a holiday anymore. I didn't notice any special holiday offerings to justify the high price they charged.
Studio B earns a solid second place on my "Best Vegas Buffets" list. They earn some serious points for including alcohol and specialty coffee in the price of the buffet. . . We had to wait about 20 minutes on a Saturday at noon for a table for 2. Because of the included alcohol, I think people linger at tables a lot longer. . . You know, it's a buffet. There's not much unique and special. The prime rib I had from the carving area was some of the best I've had on a buffet. Nothing else was super outstanding but it was all very good. I thought the desserts were above par, but then so are most desserts at the other great buffets.. . I didn't like that you had to pick up your specialty drinks like buffet items. For example, beer and wine had to be picked up from a separate counter. Lattes, espressos, etc had to be picked up from the ice cream area. I was able to get a coffee with bailey's but again, had to go get it myself. I'm not opposed to this idea completely, but each of the folks serving drinks had a place to drop tips and all our actual server did was drop water and pick up our dirty plates.. . Speaking of dirty plates, ours lingered on our table a little longer than I liked. We also noticed a number of flies in the area which wasn't a pleasant feeling. . . To recap, this is an excellent buffet, with the following exceptions: potential long waits, getting your own drinks, mediocre service, and of course, the long drive from the strip.
This was my first time at a Vegas buffet.  It was delicious and had an amazing assortment of food.  For being on a buffet I was impressed with how delicious everything was -nothing overcooked or dry.  They don't let too many people in at a time so I never had to wait in a long line for anything.   . I had crab legs, oysters, some different meats and yummy vegetable and fruit salads.  They have an excellent cider on tap.  The desserts were really fun and I tried many different ones including Tiramisu and Creme Brulee.  The coffee bar at the dessert line is also included and I had a lovely Cappuccino with Amaretto.  . I can't speak to price because someone else paid for our party and I never knew how much it was. But really, yum!
Although Studio B is a little far from the strip, it is one most favorite Buffet in last Vegas for the price.  I have eaten here many times and I always to make it a point to eat here when I am in Las Vegas.  I was finally able to make it to Vegas on the weekend when they have the Seafood Buffet, which was nothing much more special than the normal buffet beside having Oysters and Crab.   The Buffet is huge and quality of the food is really good.  California residents also get a discount.
Great Service. Friendly Staff. Went with a big group (9) we were sat very quickly. Food was good for a buffet style. A lot of variety of food.
Great food here. They have everything from sushi to mashed potatoes to salads. Plus the free beer/wine bar isn't looking too bad. I recommend this place.
All you can drink beer and wine made this great buffet even greater. I love the salmon salad,  the Korean BBQ short ribs. They were so great.  I will be back!
I found out this place caters to our neighboring California state residents. No offense to them, but I don't understand why you would cater to out of state residents, rather than the locals...maybe you would get more local foot traffic if you catered to your own?
Fantastic buffet for $17 at lunch.  All you can eat plus unlimited beverages to include Shock Top Belgian White beer.  Good selection to include Japanese, Mexican, Cajun, Meat Carving station, soap and salad bar, fresh bread.  Make sure you save room for dessert.  Awesome gelato and dessert bar, not to mention coffee and expression!  Very good quality.
As buffets go, this one was a step above the average buffet. . . At $40 per person, it really is a bit more expensive than I'm used to paying for a buffet, but the food was good, and there was also unlimited beer and wine: always a win.. . We came out on Saturday afternoon around 3:30pm for a post-wedding dinner.  We had a party of 16, and were seated right away.. . The selection of food is super varied.  Pizza, dolmas (stuffed grape leaves), pastas, oysters, salads, snow crab legs, mussells, lamb, prime rib, chicken...It was really a good, diverse buffet!. . I had:. Cesar salad: very good. not overly dressed. Fresh lettuce.. Mushroom ravioli with alfredo sauce:  amazing.  I had seconds.. Lobster mac n cheese:  a little bland, but big hunks of lobster!  I added some salt and it was good.. Oysters:  meh.  I'm a little cautious of eating seafood like this at a buffet.  They were ok, but not the best oysters I've had.. Baked potato:  it needed salt, but the cheese and bacon was great.  . Corn salad: YUM.  really delicious.. Lobster bisque: delicious.  quite possibly the best lobster bisque I've ever had.. Pho broth: no thanks.  It smelled great, but was not good.. Domas:  actually pretty decent.  Not super fresh, but they were good.. . My fella had a TON of crab legs, and his only complaint was that they were pre split.  We have crab a lot, and he's much faster cracking and splitting his own, but he said they were cooked well.  . . Dessert:  Whatever the tiny little cup of hazelnut and chocolate was THAT was my favorite.  The tiramisu shooter was ok, and the fruit panna cotta was good too.. . Its a bit spendy for me, really, but if it was another special occasion, I would definitely go back.
The free flowing wine won me over for sure!, but definitely one of my first choice for best and cleanest buffet in Vegas! The seafood are fresh, king crab legs galore indeed. Other food choices are just as fresh and good, and there are a lot, Indian, sushi, prime rib...as well as desserts.. . The wait is long but service is great and friendly always. A friend told that you come in around end of lunch to pay the price and stay til beginning of dinner. What a deal!!. . You can't go wrong with this buffet when it comes to good food and service. It's the first stop when you get to Vegas before all. The chaos at the strip.
Went to the special Friday seafood buffet.  Not worth the price for what they give you!.  This Buffet used to be among the best in Las Vegas.  There is nothing special about some crab legs, a few crawfish, and lobster mac & cheese.  The rest of their buffet was their usual offerings which are pretty good. Stick to their daily buffets rather than any special offering.
This is my second favorite buffet near Las Vegas area.  The selection was impeccable.  The seafood was fresh.  And the taste was remarkable.  The price was comparable with the other high end casinos on the strip, but the food here was much more impressive.  I love the open atmosphere and inviting feel of this place.  The lines can get quite long so  make sure to get there early.  This place beats the price on my favorite buffet, the Bucannal at Cesears Palace.  The food comes a close second.  All in all, I will be back to this buffet.
It's fair to say that the hype for this restaurant has been mounting for years. I have been wanting to go but for convenience purposes, most of my trips in the past couple of years have involved me flying into Vegas so getting a cab out just to go to this buffet didn't seem quite worth it.. . The unlimited beer and wine is a nice touch but the food didn't hit out of the park like people have been telling me. As I recount my experience here, I can't even think of any specific item where I was convinced this is the best buffet you can find around Vegas. The price point seemed to have been raised over the years as well. I could have sworn the seafood was something that helped Studio B earn its reputation, but on that day, you could sense it lacked freshness.. . Definitely did not live up to my expectations but still fair if you're staying at this casino.
Total crap buffet says $15 we got here they tried charging us $86 for holiday weekend. Dude its on Monday Dec 29 not a holiday. Total scam !!!
