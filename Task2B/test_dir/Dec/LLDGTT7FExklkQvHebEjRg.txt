Yum!  Had a fantastic dinner here!  Impeccable service, generous bartender, fabulous food.. . Try The Whale appetizer!  So good!!!
We were looking for a place for an early dinner and came across Joe's on Yelp. We arrived around 3:00 and were offered the lunch menu.. . Water and a mixed bread basket were provided immediately. Hubby opted for a lunch 2 course of 6 oz filet, roasted tomato, Jennies potatoes and banana cream pie. I ordered fried chicken, a side of creamed spinach and key lime pie. Our total bill with tip was $86. The food was delicious andthe staff attentive. . . My only knock was against the maitre d staff. The first guy loved hanging out at a particular table out of sight of the host stand. This left people just standing and wondering what to do (us included). Shift change and Mr "Handsy" takes over. This guy could not keep his hands off a coworker - the massage and pressings against her gave me the willies. From our view sexual harassment was alive and well with this guy. No matter what, it was not appropriate behavior at a restaurant.
Very good food. The Ahi and filet was outstanding. Serve was good too.
I came here after hearing wonderful things from friends about their Miami location. While I am allergic to shellfish; inhibiting me from eating the famous stone cold crabs I found other delicious options on the menu. I ordered the Branzino which was some of the best I've had. For dessert I got the famous key lime pie which tasted like heaven. My fiance got the famous crabs and raved about how tender and sweet they were. The service was wonderful and the environment warm and friendly.
Been coming here for dinner every couple weeks during Stone Crab season~ Starting off with the shrimp cocktail, which is very good~ Decided to change it up a little last night, with a crab cake appetizer- It was sublime~ The flavor was incredible~ A little spray of Lemon, and some of their amazing mustard sauce... Nuances that were so compatible, subtle, but dynamic~ They don't pan sear them like most I think, Seems they put this scoop on a broiler plate under the salamander, and gave the out side little bits of caramelization~ And I couldn't discern any filler at all!  Just Jumbo lump crab, maybe some mayo to hold it together, and seasoned perfectly~You'll have to forgive me... It was an experience I definitely have to do again soon~ As for the Claws, I Usually get the "Select" size~ Just amazing~. (And they did a better job than usual cracking the shells~ Just Awesome!. And I don't think I have to add the service is always excellent when I go~ Even if something isn't perfect, they will take full responsibility and ownership, no matter what the problem was~ Just to pay them the compliments they deserve!
Bf and I went here for Thanksgiving and had a WONDERFUL night! We shared oysters, the crab bisque and both got surf and turf (filet and lobster tail), and then shared a dessert.. . The oysters are so fresh, delicate and tasty. There is NO question that they are extremely high-quality. I could've eaten a dozen more of these bad boys.  The chef split our soup up for us into two cups, which was very nice of him to do. It is silky, rich, and seasoned just right. I think a whole bowl would be too much for me though because it is very rich.. . Our steaks were a bit more on the rare side, rather than MR but we didn't mind because they tasted so damn good. The lobster tail is grilled and split for you, and the meat was so tender and had a delicious buttery flavor. We also ordered creamed spinach, which I didn't care for but I'm not a creamed spinach fan. We also got a side of mac n cheese, of course, and it too was delicious.. . Joe's promises to always be a great experience and this was no different. I was impressed by the food, service, and ambiance as I always am when I come here. It will always remain one of my all-time favorite steakhouses. Yum!
Their stone crabs are fabulous. We ordered large size for two people and inhaled them all. Friendly staffs and nice ambience.
came here for dinner last night and it was delicious! we were surprised to find how busy the restaurant was on a tuesday night but it was packed! we ordered the stone crabs of course (a must) and the prawn plus the crab bisque for appetizers. i am a huuuge fan of the stone crabs, they serve it with this delicious mustard sauce and it goes together heavenly. our server even came around the table showing us the proper way to open the stone crab, great service! crab bisque was delicious as well, we ordered the bowl and keep in mind it was definitely large enough to feed two. for our entrees we had the bone in steak that was 24oz cooked perfectly at medium rare...it was divine. for our sides we had mac and cheese and brussel sprouts which were both delicious as well. i would definitely come back again for the stone crabs, i am in love!
Taste: 3.5. Creativity/Authenticity: 3. Atmosphere: 3.5. Service: 5. Bang for your buck: 2.5. . Lets start with this place is so far back i mean way back of caesars palace no wonder i have never eaten here before!! Lets start with overall first impressions walking up; im in shorts and a t shirt going to a fancy restaurant? expectations peering eyes and quite talk about my looks... none of that; was sat down right away, water and bread and a waiter instantly so that made me ease up and feel like i belonged. . Started with. - oysters on the half shell (MUST HAVE) depending on the oyster selection . - stone crab ( MUST HAVE). . Entrees . - Pan Sauteed Branzino with lemon & capers . - Miso glazed Chilean sea bass with bok choi . - Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon with Crispy potato cake, spinach, mushroom, red wine bordelaise. . Everything we had was amazing, cooked perfectly just needed a little more salt but overall very good. The service here is spot on as good as it gets, very friendly and honest staff. I stay at caesars every time im in vegas and I will be back IM A FAN
Joe's is located inside of Caesars and oh man was it a find. The restaurant first originated in Florida where stone crab is abundant and eventually opened offshoots in DC, Chicago and Vegas. The prices are on the high side but the quality of the seafood more than makes up for the sticker shock. I went to this restaurant a few years back and I still remember how amazing it was.. . The food:. . Stone Crab Claws- this is the dish that put the restaurant on the map. The stone claws are amazing, the flavors of the crab are wonderful and the amount of meat you gets is adequate. The honey mustard dipping sauce is the perfect pairing to the crab. The sauce is not too aggressive nor too sweet. This is a must order.. . Bacon- Wrapped Sea Scallops- this is probably the best scallop dish I ever had. The scallops were huge and cooked to perfection. The scallops are clustered together then wrapped on the outside with bacon. There were two clusters givenand it was more than filling. This is a must order.. . Crab stuffed Sole with lobster sauce- I thought this was a good dish. The sole was cooked nicely, it was moist and tender. The lobster sauce, which resembled lobster bisque, was a nice accompaniment. The crab meat while present, wasn't a major factor.. . Key Lime pie- their key lime pie is wonderful. It has a nice tart flavor and a nice crunchy bottom.
I come here at least once a year just for the stone crabs. If you valet on the strip side, the restaurant is literally 20 ft away. I've had the rib eye and the sol and both were pretty amazing.
Excellent service, food, ambience!
The best steak I've had in a while. The place was packed! luckily we had reservations. Our server was knowledgeable with wines my friend was inquiring about a certain bottle and our waiter was very engaging. (tall Asian-I really need to pay attention to names) Anyway my friend had the Chilean Sea bass, could not believe that was fish! really fluffy and flavorful. My steak cooked and seasoned juuuust perfect. . . Will be back for sure need to get the full Chilean sea bass next time. :)
Hubby and I had dinner here before catching a show while in Vegas and it was great! The host who was greeting us had an infectious excited energy that really set the tone for the dinner. Crispy onion straws, juicy steak and a perfectly cooked fish made for a delicious meal. I also had the cucumber martini, it was strong but refreshing. Our server was very sweet and we let her know we were on our way to show and she had everything out promptly and efficiently.  I would definitely come back here.
Truly a gem.  It's a five out of five for what Joe's wants to be.  Great restaurant, with great food, great service, great selection and has never disappointed for me.  Have visited numerous times both for lunch and dinner.  Service has never failed.  Food has never failed.  They are awesome from the moment you are greeted to when you leave.  Typically I always ordered the Stone Crab claws for the main, but have decided in the last two visits to have the filet as the main and start with a lighter amount of Stone Crab to start.  Amazing beef, cooked to my asking, with a good seasoning.  Awesome!!!  Try to visit every time I'm in Las Vegas but is always busy so try to book a few days before.
The food is delicious. If you are worried about price then don't come, but I'm telling you the food is worth any price. We enjoyed ourselves very much partially because out waiter, Neil, was a true gem. We will come back.
Have to come here at least once during each of my Vegas trips. Filet mignon and lobster tail is amazing. Stone Crab legs are to die for! Great service to boot! Worth every penny! And it is very expensive.
Joe's is a strip gem which I always recommend to visitors.  Even though I don't get to the strip very often I try to hit it at least once a year for their lunch special. This year I did Christmas day and had the crab bisque, a serving of the "whale" appetizer, and half a piece of their seasonal pecan pumpkin pie.  Excellent as always.
Looking for eating options in Vegas and I can not tell you how STOKED I was to see this pop up on my yelp feed.  I tried Joe's Stone Crab in Miami, Florida and it was probably one of my most memorable restaurant experiences.  This is their sister restaurant.  AND NOW I HAVE ONE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE US! Ok, it's not quite in LA...but it's doable.  It's slightly hard to find if you're starting from the Caesar's casino, but it's worth the long walk.  Made a reservation for lunch with my family at 11:30am (their opening time) and was seated very promptly.  . . Service was amazing and the waiter was helpful and hilarious.  The staff really seemed like they were all very well trained and enjoyed working there and it created an awesome atmosphere for us to enjoy.  And the food came out QUICK! I love and appreciate fast service because ain't nobody got time to be hangry.. . Now on to the food:. BREAD: You get an assortment of bread.  Our basket included a variety of about five different types including a traditional dinner roll, onion roll, pretzel bread, and bacon & ciabatta.  Load up on the carbs (:. . HOT CHOCOLATE: It was so delicious.  None of that watered down hot chocolate nonsense found here.  Really satisfied my craving for hot chocolate and their whip cream is freshly home-whipped.  YUM!. . CRAB BISQUE: The size difference jumps a lot from cup to bowl.  I love their presentation.  You're first served with a bowl with crab bits and stuff in the middle and then the server pours the bisque all over it.  I don't know if they do that for the cups, but it is a nice touch. Flavor is nothing short of what I expected.. . MEDIUM STONE CRAB: Our waiter recommended us to get two orders of this (vs. a jumbo order with less claws) for our party of seven so we each could get two claws.  You still have to take off the shell of the crab, but they pre-crack it for you so it's almost like peeling a boiled egg shell.  A MUST ORDER while eating here.. . JUMBO ALASKAN KING CRAB LEGS: Ugh this was amazing! Another MUST ORDER!! The meat was easy to slide out and it had a sweet scrumptious taste to it. Dip that into the mustard or butter sauce and it's pretty mindblowing. Too good!!. . COLOSSAL LUMP CRAB CAKE:  This was the only dish that we ordered that I could have lived without.  It was good, but I just felt like it was a tad bit on the extra fried side to me.. . ALASKAN KING CRAB ROLL:  I will totally order this again.  It's a perfect order of seafood, if you don't want to over order or go over budget haha.  They stuff the roll with fresh crab meat and it comes with a side of their homemade chips (which are pretty much perfection).. . SEAFOOD CHOPPED SALAD:  This is also perfect if you're feeling full already.  This salad comes with the Alaskan Crab, Lobster, and Shrimp on top of salad with a vinaigrette.  It's so good. Like wow good. Wow.. . WILD MUSHROOM MAC & CHEESE:  It is most definitely on the cheesy side and it's freaking delicious.  One side order is worth sharing because it's a lot to finish, but it's worth a try to all the cheese lovers out there.. . KEY LIME PIE: THE ONLY key lime pie I've ever liked was at the Joe's in Miami. And they serve it just as good here. It's pretty freaking awesome and you're either an idiot for not ordering it (or you're too full haha). Just kidding that was mean...but it's really yummy!. . I can't rave about this place enough. One of my favorite restaurants ever and you have to come and splurge a little bit here. . . SIDENOTE: You can order from their dinner menu for lunch if you're interested! (:
Great upscale restaurant!! . . While planning a great trip to the lovely Las Vegas area, Joe's crossed my list as one of the top places to eat--thanks to my fellow yelpers! I wanted to impress the hubby with a romantic dinner and amazing steak. And after much debt-- I decided Joe's would be it!. . Let me say if you come in the main entrance of the Caesars Palace you are jacked and I hope you have on comfortable shoes! The restaurant is on the far end of the hotel and located in the shopping and eating plaza of the hotel. Make sure you ask somebody if you are not sure, or you will get an amazing amount of exercise before you eat. After our long hike from the beginning of the hotel to the restaurant, we finally made it to JOE'S (AHHHHH*** angel music in the background). There was a gentlemen hostess outside the restaurant behind a booth --who was taking seating request for people as they came up to the restaurant (there was a wait). Luckily for the hubby and I, I made reservations a few days in advance. The host escorted us into the restaurant and into a second check in area and a second dining room area for those who made reservations. This area was kind of sectioned off and I felt very exclusive! After the second host confirmed our name we were immediately seated. The set up and decorations of Joe's is so upscale, I felt like I traveled back in time to the early 1900s and dining at the classist establishment in Vegas. The lighting is dim and romantic and the waiters all wear full tuxedos. . . The hubby and I were seated in a cushiony booth and immediately given water and bread from the sub server. After a couple of minutes our waiter made his way to our table and went through the menu and what the day's specials were. I placed an order for a glass of wine and the hubby ordered water (not sure what wine I ordered--its Vegas and I had a few before I got there). The wine was very good-- I do know that much. Everything sounded so good on the menu, I couldn't decide what to order. I ended up ordering the King Crab Louis Salad and the Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs. The hubby ordered the filet mignon steak. The salad was so amazing and fresh! It was the best crab salad I have ever had! The Jumbo crab legs I could have gone without-- the market price was 20 or 30 bucks and I only received like a piece of 2 legs--it looked like an appetizer--but I guess that's what is served at upscale places. We also ordered a side of steamed asparagus and mac and cheese. Everything was just amazing and mouth watering and our server was on point from the time we came till the very end of our meal. My husband's water was never empty and we were completely tended to by the waiter and the servers. His steak was also made to perfection and very juicy. This was an excellent restaurant and I will def. go again when I visit the Vegas area. The waiter also informed us there is a location in the DC area, so I may not have to wait long before I try this great place again!
Yummy!! Super emotional eater here! Came here for a friends first anniversary celebration (just so happens to be NYE). GREAT service compliments of Steven P.  I had the seafood platter - SO GOOD! Sides who? Cauliflower Puree with scallops... OH BOY!  Eat here! Eat here!
