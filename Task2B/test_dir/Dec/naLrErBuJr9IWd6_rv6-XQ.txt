I am going to give 5 stars but with two disclaimers.. I called the morning of our reservation to ask themarket price of the lobster, and the hostess said the lobster wouldn't be on the menu.  . When we arrived, we were taken to a table by the service entrance which was very frenetic with constant traffic, despite multiple open tables that were still open when we left  If you make reservations, ask for a booth in the back area.. The bread was amazing, multiple choices, and fantastic flavor.  I did have the lobster which WAS on the menu, and it was fantastic.  The waiter removed the shell for me which was awesome.  My husband had the Nebraska Rib Eye and said it was the best steak he ever had.  We had the brussel sprout side dish which was fantastic.. The music was largely techno, and very loud and annoying. But for the great steak and lobster, have to give it a 5.
The steak was amazing!! I remember when I went with my friends, all girls were share the food but I ordered for myself as I love steak lol the cut is one of my favorite restaurant for steak house. The foods are delicious. The restaurant was pretty cozy and elegant. I definitely will come back soon :)
Ate here the other night and thought it was great!  . . What really made this place special was the impeccable service that we received.  Not once did we NEED anything.  Drop your napkin on the floor?  Fresh one is supplied before you even notice it was missing.  Make a mess on the table, someone comes and cleans it up.. . The food was delicious, but my eyes were bigger than my stomach.  My table got 2 appetizers, 2 steaks, and 2 sides, split one dessert.. Appetizers were just large enough -- but sort of filled us up.  The mac n cheese side was delicious, but huge.  I think that it could have comfortably served 4 (as a side).. . Next time I am in town, (and can afford the extravagant prices) I am definitely going back.  Yes it was expensive, but MORE than worth it.  There wasn't a single thing that we didn't like.
Just dined here this evening with a group of foodies. I was left without words. Best steak I've had in my life. Period. . . From entering this fine dining establishment to leaving after paying a generous tip, Cut Las Vegas delivered every aspect of a modern steakhouse to a 100% level. Fantastic service and impeccable food. A medium rare grass fed dry aged piece of meat has never tasted so good. I would post a photo but all you would see is an empty plate. Yelp pointer - try their sides. Add bone marrow to your steak. Enjoy a glass of red wine. Appreciate life's beauty with great company and amazing food.
The hubby and I are thoroughly enjoying CUT in the Venetian/Palazzo hotel. The service is excellent. The house apple salad was superb. I had the 3 beef sampler with the Japanese Wagyu, American Wagyu, and the regular aged beef. I enjoyed all three. The Japanese wagyu was like butter, but the American Wagyu was my fav. Full of flavor and tenderness. A very nice blend of American beef with Japanese Wagyu.  I highly recommend you try this place.  Also the Mac And cheese was great (I'm not a Mac and cheese kind of girl)!!!. . . . Very, very please. -Dr. A
Definitely the BEST steak I've ever had, ever.  The U.S. Wagyu Rib Eye that I had (done medium) was juicy and super flavorful. Ordered 2 sauces but didn't end up needing them as the steak was fantastic on its own. Took the additional caramelized onion topping and it went very well with the steak. Highly recommended - I am definitely returning.!!
Definitely worth a visit. And no, it's not one of those places that are overhyped. Had the Maryland blue crab and Carolina shrimp for starter- crab was fresh and sweet, texture of the firm shrimps combined with the soft avocado was well balanced and the horseradish added just the right amount of punch to the sea flavors. I like my meat with more flavor and some texture rather than totally melt-in-your-mouth , so I decided to go with the U.S (instead of Japanese) wagyu filet mignon. This was tender and flavorful for a filet mignon. I asked for medium and it was cooked to perfection - well seared on the outside and beautifully charred which gave it that smoky flavor and pink in the middle with the juice retained. Creamed spinach was slightly weak in flavor for my liking but Mac-n-cheese was great. We paired the meat with a Darioush signature range cab sav- good amount of depth but still easy to drink and fairly affordable.
Best steak I've ever had! Crab appetizer, Mac n cheese, and the bread were all great too. Service was also excellent.
I was underwhelmed by CUT and so were others in my party of 6.  Had better experiences in other steakhouses in Vegas.
If you are steak lover and visiting Las Vegas you must give this place a try. I had the honor of dining here with several friends. Wow! What more can you ask for as a steak lover. I have to say you are going to be paying a lot for your meat. It's worth it all the way. I used to be big fan of Mastor's until I came here. Hands down the best steak money can buy.. . If you are a person who loves great meat and outstanding dishes. What more can you ask for as a steak lover.  It's worth it all the way. I used to be big fan of Mastor's until I came here. If you are from NY and love Keens Steakhouse in Manhattan then you need to long no place else.. . I highly recommend the bone in filet to the 8 ounce Kobe steak. If you are looking for great starters I would get pink Fiji peach salad or the butter lettuce. For side dished I would highly creamed spinach and roasted Brussels sprouts. Leave room for desert. The banana cream pie or the baked Alaska pear.. . Service 10+. Quality 10+
CUT is a cut above the rest.  Definitely one of the best steakhouses on the strip.  Can be a bit pricey if you want to dabble into some of the higher end cuts of meats, like the Wagyu, but if you do you will not be disappointed.. . The decor and service is top of the line as are the steaks.  I have had better apps and sides at some restaurants in Vegas, but the American Wagyu I had was phenomenal. . . Also, if you are a chocolate fan... the souffle is the best I have ever had.  Absolutely amazing.  . . If you are in town and willing to spend a little bit, you need to come to CUT.
Was not the best steak I've ever had in my life but hey it's Vegas...everything is overpriced but this is one of the restaurants on my bucket list and I had to hit it up. My bill was under $200 for a couple steaks and a couple glasses of wine. I would probably be returning here again
From the focaccia and pretzel bread to the finely seasoned New York sirloin, Cut exceeded my expectations. Chip, along with several others provided attentive service.  Do not leave without tasting the Mac and cheese!  Cut is definitely a place to eat when you want fine dining in Vegas.
Amazing steak house. Had one of the best ribeye steaks (with an egg on it). The short rib (cooked with garam masala), wagyu sashimi are amazing.
Came here for the first time on Christmas evening. Erin was our server and did an amazing job. I normally stay away from overpriced pretentious steakhouses but I heard good things and they did not disappoint. Wagyu sashimi is a must! All of our steaks were American wagyu. We didn't spring for then Japanese Yaqui but were still very pleased with the filet and 34oz porterhouse for 2. Erin did a great job explaining the menu and guiding us in the right direction.
Read the reviews and ordered the porterhouse for two with a side of bone marrow...WOW..was the marrow rich..I think we drank an extra bottle of wine because of that.. . The porterhouse rare..was perfect..cold center and melt in your mouth tender.. . The wild mushrooms sides was delicious.
