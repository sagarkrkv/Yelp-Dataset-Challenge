Dinner and lunch is very different. We only went during brunch. I liked that they had a variety. No crab but they did have cooked mussels, shrimp pasta, and baked cod. There mid-eastern was good and the only buffet that had this. Love their chicken curry.
Was really good I did the 24 hour buffetat  this place it was real good I loved it no complaints other than the long line The desserts were kind of on the low side though
This buffet has gone down hill significantly over the years. Foods are average quality at best. Asian selections are down right nasty, simply inedible. It is on par with Panda Express. The other ethnic foods are just OK, not worth the full price of $30 for dinner.
Very decent buffet with wide range of variety. You can find everything from crab legs to prime rib, flan and crepes. I must highlight the server lady for her excellent service despite the demand from dinner crowd. All in all, we like it, worth your money.
Decent lunch buffet..They had a Mediterranean/Indian , chinese, mexican, seafood, american, salad section..
I went there twice during my stay at planet hollywood and I loved it so much!. There was a long line around 6:30pm but I am a platinum member of total rewards program so I was able to skip the line. No wait at all!. This place is busy but their servers are so quick and efficient! . One came to our table probably 4 times to make sure everything was ok. . I liked their seafood and asian section. Well their Italian and American food were also good so in other words everything was good!. Just a side note, the iced tea that I got was so tasty as well!. I would definitely go back.
I wish I can put this with no stars, most of the food was disgusting, not only this, the lady on the cashier was so rude, the only good thing was the server she was smiling all the time and came to our table several time to check if we need anything, I paid $82 for two persons but honestly, i shouldn't paid $5 for this
Came here for dinner and almost solely for the crab legs.  And roast beef and bbq ribs.  And desserts.  and fruits.. . It was pretty empty during a mid-December, mid-week exploration so wife and I practically had clear sights to the food and friendly and attentive wait staff.
I loved this place. We came across this place while walking the strip. A promoter gave us a wrist band to the club but we ended up going to the buffet instead. The food was amazing. The crab legs were to die for. Our servers were top notch & were constantly visiting our group making sure we had refills & more crab legs. The dessert was soooo good. They have everything you can imagine. I will be back!
I've been here many times before and it was good enough for us to come back. However, this time I couldn't find any single item that I liked. I tried many different things until I don't want to eat any more. Won't be coming back again for sure.
Rude people. Terrible food. We bought the buffet pass and had 24 hours to eat as much as we wanted! But since 2 of the buffets that counted towards our pass were closed and and the other was across town, that left Planet Hollywood. We ate there twice and couldn't go back.
Yikes! Where to start?! I'm pretty easy going, so buffets are generally always a good thing.  Unfortunately, Spice Market didn't deliver.  First, while eating the food, I watched the chefs use their bare hands to transfer food from dish to dish (yes, the food you eat!)  Generally, I'm not a big complainer, but when you go from ready to serve food, to your dish towel, and back to ready to serve food...I'm less than thrilled.  Next, I watched the same chef take food OFF of a customer's plate, and place it back into the serving line! Oh my! Glad I didn't eat the prime rib, because she served the SAME piece back to ANOTHER customer!. . As for the food? More than half of what I ate was cold, or lukewarm at best.  I actually had my waitress test the sliders, as it was still mostly frozen! Such a waste!. . Also, for a place with such good reviews on the desserts, I can't say that I was at all impressed.  With so many choices, and not a single label identifying what any of them are, how do you know what to try?  Those that I did try were totally bland and tasteless.  So disappointed in this Buffet!
Diverse, plentiful buffet. Great options ranging from seafood, Italian, Mexican, middle eastern, soup and salad stations. Went for lunch and everything was well prepared. The seafood was a little skimpy with just stuffed sole am mussels as the features. No lobster or crab. Most of the station had some breakfast items despite it being after 2 PM. Still the food was quality and plenty of variety. The pastries and desserts were exceptional, especially the cupcakes. The middle eastern chicken and lamb were also standouts.
