Meat lovers this is the place for you! I look forward to TDB every year for my birthday, even though they no longer give you a free meal on your birthday, because it's damn worth it! A lot of people complain about them not giving the free birthday meal anymore and I was pissed at first too but hey they still send email offers with discounts so it's all good. It's around $50 per person for dinner and a bit cheaper at lunch time. It's worth every penny! If I had my way I'd just start with the meat and skip the salad bar however my wife really looks forward to the salad bar here and I always end up finding some meats and cheeses to grub on. The salad bar has tons of things and everything is fresh. You can just pay around $20 for the salad bar if that's all you want but why the hell come to TDB for just the salad bar? MEAT! The meat is boss here. Service is excellent and the meat is never ending. This last visit I must have had 8 different types of meat! I'm not much of a chicken eater but the bacon wrapped chicken here is so flavorful. I can't get enough of the bacon wrapped filet either. One thing I could stand to not see while I'm enjoying a nice meal is some lady breastfeeding her kid. Let me say that I have no issue when it comes to a mother feeding her child but I'm not paying good money to see it, this kid looked 3 years old, and I saw this ladies bare tatas several times throughout my meal. I'm positive the bathroom would have been more appropriate! I'm also sure when the kid has teeth that can bite you back that you should give the kid a damn cup to drink from! Our server was great and checked on us often. They give you round cards that you flip to red if you don't want anymore meat and you flip to green when you do want more. They have men going around with several types of meats and are great about bringing you the types of meats you like and cooked the way you like. The bar has really good HH deals too. TDB is well worth the money and I'll definitely be back.
This place is always very busy so I would highly recommend tomake a reservation in advance or expect to wait 1-2 hours! They have different varieties of Brazilian meats like sirloin,  chicken, lamb chops, lamb shank, beef and pork ribs, sausages and my favorite top sirloin (Picanha) ! I'd be happy if they just served me Picanha all night! It has a little layer of fat over the sirloin and is excellent medium rare. All the meats are served on skewers which are brought and sliced for you tableside by the gauchos, always fresh and delicious. Don't forget the side of chimichurri for a dipping sauce for your meats. Besides the delicious marinated meats, they also have an excellent salad bar. Tons of different salads, veggies, deli meats & cheeses. There is also lobster bisque and feijoada (Brazilian black beans) which is delicious over white rice topped with Farofa. Brazilian cheese bread (very addicting), mashed potatoes and sweet bananas are also served  tableside. You have to save room for desert! I love the Brazilian cheesecake, which has a layer of chocolate in it and is drizzled with caramel. We always leave here full and satisfied so definitely come hungry.
After years of living in Las Vegas, I finally made time in in my work schedule to make here one night with my wife.  We walked right in and were seated within minutes (without reservations).  We had a nice two seat table and the waitress was very friendly and explained how everything worked since it was our first time dining there.  Her thick accent made it a little difficult to understand but we sort of figured out there fantastic salad bar...we returned to our seat where we were greeted with an amazing meat selection! They all tasted amazing (chicken,pork,beef). There was only one beef that came out a little too rare for us, but not necessarily bad...so we would deff. recommend this place forany anniversary, birthday, special occasion, or just a night out with friends or family
Absolutely excellent food. Very pricey, but for the amount of fine meats you get the price is justified. We went here for my fathers B-day, and were very impressed. The service was great and the men with the meat skewers were at our table constantly. Go here with an appetite because its AYCE. Overall the salad bar area was pretty good. I didn't like some of the things, but there were enough choices that you can find at least a couple things you like. The meat is the star here. Will definitely go back for a special occasion if we are in the area.
You will hate yourself the rest of the night but the food is pretty good.  Most of the meats are very nice and they give you the temperature you ask for.  Some are very very dry like pork and chicken but all the beef is great.  Salad bar is actually quite nice but that's not the main attraction.. . Service is good, food is good, you will overeat and feel like crap but it's worth it. Not sure if it's worth $50 a pop though.
Was okay. Extremely loud and seating arrangements aren't placed very well. Food is great. Servers are fast with the meat, but slow on beer orders. Salad buffet was nice and interesting.
First of all if you decide to eat here do yourself a favor and make a reservation. I didn't do so and had to wait 90 minutes. I will say it was worth the wait. This is an all you can eat restaurant so go hungry. Unlike the traditional Vegas buffets the main course is delivered to you by servers. You have a two sided plaque at your table one side is green and the servers will stop by with different cuts of various meats and poultry and they won't stop until you tap out and flip the plaque to the red side. I sampled every cut on the menus and each one was better than the previous one. They also had a full bar and large wine list. I can't comment on the alcohol no room for it.
Omg this place is so good. It's best to make reservations cause it was packed but I think they are always packed. I ordered a strawberry lemonade which was to die for. Most of the meats were good. The only one I didn't like was the Parmesan chicken but other than that I left the restaurant like everybody I saw walking out...stuffed!
Our waitress was horrible. By far the worst I have experienced. I made reservations for our party of 20. Everyone with exception of our waitress was amazing. She had a horrible attitude and hated the fact she had our table from the moment we were seated. Not one of us will ever go back because she made it that awful for us.
I came here tonight as part of the holiday festivities and gluttony. Take heed! Be prepared to wear your sexy fat clothes as your belly gets filled. For you may have a popped button or three during the duration of your meal. . . The ambiance is quite lovely and our server, Claudio, was attentive and very helpful. He is awesome! . . We ventured out to the salad bar to start. I would suggest something refreshing to balance out the meat and fat.  I recommend the asparagus, palm heart, and artichoke hearts. Very light, refreshing, and oh so yummy. . . Some Brazilian cheese bread for the table was addictive and delicious. I couldn't take my hands away from these small puffy balls of cheese filled bread. Oh my goodness. The side of fried banana with a hint of cinnamon was also delicious. I personally didn't like the mashed potatoes. It tasted artificially grainy to me. . . Now on to the goodies we are all here for: . . Remember, green means go and red means stop. A card placed at your side, flip it over to red when you have enough on your plate and green when you are ready for more. I recommend 2-3 pieces of meat at a time. . . I came for my beef and lamb fix as I usually have a more vegetarian based diet but absolutely love beef and lamb. . . I think the highlight of my meal would be filet mignon, leg of lamb, lamb chops, and Brazilian picanha. . . I would've given it a 5 star but noticed that the consistency of how meat is cooked and brought out can be vastly different. The first lamb chop I tasted was just perfect- tender, flavorful, and cooked just right. Second round of meats came and my lamb chop was slightly chewy, less flavorful, and slightly disappointing. Same for the leg of lamb. It was slightly overcooked the first time but was cooked beautifully the second time. Yes! I had a few rounds of lamb! No shame! Also, the meat is a bit on the salty side so be prepared to drink a lot.  . . Would I come here again? Yes I totally would.
This is THE place for all the meat lovers like me!!!. I went there more than 10 times and every time I feel like I'm in paradise :) . They have good quality meat and great wines selection. . If you're looking for good meat meal this is definitely the address.
When we walked into the restaurant, the dumb guy in the front said 1 hour wait, then we found out it was 10 minutes wait. That goes to show how lazy they were, they didn't want to assist us they thought by saying 1 hour it would make us go. How lazy of them! so less than 10 minutes later we got seated, the rude waitress was fake as heck. she did not look like she wanted to work. We kindly asked her for more plates of mash potatoes because we were a party of 10 and there was only 2 plates on the table and the second one nearly done. So once my sister asked her for more she said I will bring one once that full one is done you have a fresh one sitting there. That is the most rudest thing I've heard! what kind of customer service is that! I told my sister how i thought that was rude and i think the waitress heard me and felt stupid so she came back with a new platter of mashed potatoes and my cousin didnt see her bringing it so he asked can you please bring more mashed pototaoes for us , and she was like,  I did already, "wow you guys must really love mashed potatoes". what makes me mad is that she was making it such a HUGE deal like damn lady youre not effing paying for it so why do you keep on making little excuses not to bring more darn mashed potatoes how hard was that for her to understand. She had an extreme fake attitude. The staff here sucked they were fake and majority of them did not seem like they wanted to work! The pricing also is NOT worth it. Its a complete rip off, the food made my stomach hurt. Anyway, it was poor customer service here. I would never go back here again, I got a very bad impression of this place and overall did not enjoy it or feel satisfied!
This is my brother-in-laws favorite restaurant, so for his birthday we went to Texas de . Brazil......... I am so confused as to why people love this place?????????. It just isn't my kind of restaurant...... . The salad bar/buffet area is okay.... it has some nice selection and choices...... But I am not a huge fan of buffet....... 85 people all reaching into the same pan as you.... touching the same utensils..... coughing.... sneezing... picking through food that is just sitting there under lamps..... sitting... sitting... ugh. . The potatoes they bring to the table are good, creamy..... . The meat is mediocre at best..... There are soooooo many good steak houses in Vegas!!! You can get a much higher quality steak, pork, chicken, or lamb at any of them!. . Is it just the obsession with the AMOUNT of food you get, instead of the QUALITY of food you get?
I love this place! Ive been roughly 10 times, and each time service and food was outstanding. Their garlic  sirloin is my favorite. Try their chimichurra sauce. Salad bar and other filler items are good. Location is good. Go check this place out if your on the fence. Come hungry and pace yourself eating. Dont even waist your time eating the chicken
