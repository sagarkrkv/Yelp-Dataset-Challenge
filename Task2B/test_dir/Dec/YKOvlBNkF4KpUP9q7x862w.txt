I read the yelp reviews and had high expectations. Great social setting and really good ambiance. Nice selection of margaritas  which is a must for a good Mexican restaurant. The claimed house special is pork shoulder. Unfortunately, I came away disappointed. It was dry from the long smoke which means the meat was not wrapped or injected. Apps were good to very good and the guac was very good. Nice blend of jalapenos, Serrano and chipotle puree. Overpriced but at least every dish is made to order.
First time visit and I'm a fan! Tried a variety of margaritas--all were good--especially the avocado. Sample several dishes and there wasn't a bad one in the bunch.  The short rib tacos really stood out.  The only drawback were the desserts.  I wasn't overly impressed with any of them, and we tried them all.  All in all, the best meal in town!
Went here when some of my friends from NYC came to visit me on a recommendation. And we were all very pleased. The decor is beautiful. The food excellent. Try the corn it's delicious. I had the short ribs. They were perfect!  Dessert was great! A very good experience. A bit pricey but well worth it I promise.
During a recent trip to Scottsdale, a few friends and I tried to make last second reservations here. Of course they had nothing available since we tried to reserve it at the last minute.  So we rolled the dice and just headed over to see if could wait it out.  We ended up waiting about 45 minutes for a table.  Not bad overall.  . . We started with the chips, salsa, and guacamole.  Their guacamole is absolutely delicious.  Not cheap though.  And they prepare it right at your table so you can determine what goes in, and how spicy you want it.  One friend and I shared the pork shoulder with flour tortillas.  It was delicious.  I also ordered a mojito which was also very good.  We sat out on the patio and it was a beautiful night so it was perfect.  Service was also very good.  Food is a little pricey for what it is, but in the end you get what you pay for.  Overall a very good experience.
My wife and I went on a Friday night and made a reservation for 2 at 8:30 at about 4:00 that same day. I looked at the menu on line and it is pricy for small plates, but so the trend goes. We stayed in Phoenix for this trip and wanted to do some shopping and Old Town Scottsdale was recommended so the search for good food began. The Mission is pretty along with all the people that work here and many of its clients. Being from LA and in our 40's we didn't feel out of place;LOL.. The service was good although not outstanding, and the food was great but not a WOW experience. We had Squash tacos, Mahi tacos, Grilled Romaine Salad, Made at the Table Guacamole, and most notable the Poblano Grits. It is what it is; ENJOY.
Wanted to try something new. Site seems tucked away in the touristy old town, which made me happy we discovered it. Atmosphere was great, had dinner and sat on the patio with the open sky and gas fire going. Service was wonderful. The guacamole was delicious along with the pork appetizer. We also recommend the beef skewer appetizer. We added the foie gras but didn't see it added so the waitress brought out a whole new app with it at no charge. The house margarita is the best I have had in old town. Everything tastes savory, fresh and delicious.
Go. Hurry and go. Mexican food with such an amazing flavor balance and layers. Chef Matt carter is remarkable. Try the beef skewers and add foie gras!  Trust me. Coming from California where foie gras is outlawed we were smiling ear to ear.  Table side guacamole is scrum. Short rib tacos and the street corn off the Cobb. Finish with the pumpkin bread pudding with creme brulee baked inside and topped with pomegranates and pepitas. Perfection for a meal. White glove service too from Emilio!!
Just went to The Mission for the first time and the experience was fantastic.  I'll start with the best and most important part first...the food!  The food was incredible!!!  So flavorful.  I had the steak tacos which were very plain and  not much to them, but couldn't believe the flavor!  They were delicious!!  My fiance had the pork shoulder and it was amazing...again, SO flavorful!!  The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is so cool.  We sat on the back patio which was beautiful.  The staff is amazing, so very nice!  The hostess was very patient with us as we weren't sure if we were going to stay and wait for a table, the waitresses were very nice, the manager came over and talked with us, the bartender was energetic and kind, as well as all the other staff we encountered.  Great experience, amazing food, and wonderful staff!  The Mission is a must!!
Great food and service at the mission. Was happy with customer service and atmosphere of restaurant
Great find new The Saguaro, which was where I was staying. Tequila selection was good and the margaritas are very well made by the staff of friendly bartenders. This review is only for the bar and I did not have a full meal here. The guac was probably the best I've ever had - something like 12 ingredients are involved in making it. Ambiance was also fun and somewhat upscale trendy with the Southwest/Mexican touch.
Wow!  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  Impeccable service, nary an empty glass.  No plates hanging around after we finished with them, promptly cleared.  Manager was making the rounds making sure service was flawless.. . And the food.  OMG, the food!  Hands down the best homemade tortillas I've had the pleasure of experiencing!  The skirt steak tacos and flat iron steak were divine.  We both loved the Mission fries too.  Unfortunately we did not experience table side made guacamole, but judging by the 2 women moaning in ecstasy next to us, I'd say it's pretty fantastic!. . Margaritas were delicious, and be sure to try the crispy pork cola appetizer.  Such unique flavors, you must try it.. . Word to the wise, we're from Seattle and "casual" means t-shirts and jeans to us.  Needless to say, we were the only people in t-shirts and jeans on a Thursday evening.  I'd kick it up a notch if you can.
We  both liked this place, but I definitely like it more than my wife. Fun outdoor patio, really nice but we sat indoors. We split the grilled Romain salad which was delicious ...Yum...  especially the black beans. Whatever you do, try the Grilled Street Corn, it was the best corn we've ever eaten! The Roast Corn Gordita were delicious too and the Marinated Jidori Chicken good. My wife's Mahi mahi fish tacos were really the only thing that were just okay. But the presentation of everything was beautiful and the service was excellent even though the place was really really busy on a Sunday night. The seating is kind of crammed and jammed in... it was a little like we were sharing conversation with both of the couples on either side of us so that's the only not perfect part of the atmosphere. But it's a lively place an we think it's worth a try if you like latin flavors.
This place is great!  I enjoyed the flavor of every meal on the table. Probably the best guacamole I have ever had. The only thing I will complain about is the price for what you get. It's very high for the quantity of food.  If that does not phase you then by all means this is a great place. Try the ghost pepper sauce!
It was on Christmas evening and was my first experience I had to spit out the food, literally.  The scallops entree arrived more than half hour after the appetizers and were extremely salty and completely inedible.  I had to return it but decided to leave the restaurant as I had no patience to wait for another half hour for another dish.  The tacos appetizers however were very good, so was the service.
We came for Christmas Eve and had a spectacular meal. The service was attentive but relaxed. We were not rushed through our meal as the other reviews indicated.  We would highly recommend the guacamole by the table and the glazed pork belly appetizer.   Margaritas were delicious.   A wow experience. I wish we lived around here so we could experience it again.
Wow, we received a recommendation for this place from a local guide and he was right - this place was the best. Table side Guacamole was the best... But you MUST try the chicken torta - its definitely on my top ten things I've eaten around the world.
If you have any kind of food allergies I would not recommend this place. I told the waitress I am allergic to Gluten, dairy, soy, corn and potatoes. I ordered the Salmon and since everything that came with it I could not have I asked if I could get Steamed Vegetables..she asked the Chef and said they only had Cod & green beans. I specifically said NO Butter. When I got my food the beans were covered in butter..I even had 3 other people confirm there was butter. The Mgr tried to tell me that "The Cod has a buttery texture" ..non the less I left hungry
Here's a new one.  Where is the best place to eat in Old Town on Christmas Day?  The answer:  an old white church in the middle of town.. . On December 25, the doors to the Mission swung open at 2 pm, and not a moment earlier.  The crowd gathered outside this rustic old building immediately swung into action, darting inside to secure a table in the much sleeker and un-Church-like confines of a trendy Latin American restaurant, where the only thing that's holy is the tequila selection.  . . Indeed, the Mission boasts a most impressive interior, with beautiful furnishings that are aggressive but tasteful, contrasted nicely with antiquated style of the building itself.  Waiting for a table would hardly be a punishment on this festive day, but with a reservation, we were seated promptly.. . The Mission is and always will be a successful restaurant, I think, because it serves truly first-rate food and drink.  There is no debating this.  Each dish that was brought out, from the duck empanadas to the crispy pork belly, packed enormous flavor into perfectly-textured bites.  The portions were sizable for appetizers, too, ensuring that you could create a tapas experience for yourself without going home hungry.  The cocktails were also delicately prepared and delicious, and in many cases inventive.  . . Because this restaurant has the food and drink down to a tee, it has the potential to be a five-star powerhouse for years to come.  But I hesitate to anoint it as such due to some conspicuous flaws in service, which should be easy to fix.  On at least five different occasions through the meal someone on staff attempted to remove a plate before we were done eating.  The wait time for drinks was also too long, perhaps owing to the cocktails' complexity, but also perhaps to the need for another bartender to churn out drinks for a thriving and busy restaurant.  . . Above all else, though, the service was friendly and generous, complementing well the warm and inviting vibe this space gives off.  Next time I make a southwest sojourn, I will gladly return.
The Mission is located in an inviting building adjacent to what looks like a Spanish-style church. You walk in through the outdoor patio, which looks cozy with a roaring fireplace. It was a bit too cold for outside, so we opted for indoor seating. It was packed on a Monday night! We put our name down and was told it could be up to an hour wait. The high-top table in the bar looked so inviting that we decided to eat there instead. It gave us a nice view of the place, which had wonderful chandeliers set low over the dining tables. The overall feel was intimate and romantic, with a rockstar edge.. . The waitress was phenomenal. Extremely knowledgeable about the menu and passionate about the restaurant. I was thoroughly impressed. Service was excellent.. . We ordered their award-winning Blood Orange margarita and the guac to start with. A guy came to the table and made the guac right in front of us. It was a nice touch, but I wish the experience was more interactive. He didn't ask us anything beyond how spicy we wanted it. Other Yelpers rave about the guac. It's okay. :). . For our main dish, we shared the mahi mahi tacos and the pork shoulder. The mahi mahi was perfectly fried. I found myself wanting a sauce of some kind on the tacos. I ended up adding the sweet BBQ sauce from the pork dish. Not the ideal combo, but it worked! The pork dish looked amazing. My companions said the meat was very moist and the self-built tacos were delicious. . . We also ordered the Grilled Street Corn and Black Bean Puree. The street corn is a corn on the cob topped with a rich, spicy, creamy sauce. It was the favorite for all of us. Very, very good. The black bean puree also packed some heat and was tasty. . . We were too full for dessert, and so we waddled away, happy and content.
