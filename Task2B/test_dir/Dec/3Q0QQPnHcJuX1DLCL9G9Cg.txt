I like this airport. It's clean, filled with lots of different food and snack options, has a few shops to shop at, and even has a massage parlor in here to get pampered while you wait for your flight! WHAT. . . I also had a mishap at the security checkpoint and somehow temporarily lost my ID and boarding pass when I set it down to take off my jacket and shoes. I was freaking out because I thought I wouldn't be able to get in and it was just stressful. But one of the TSA workers tried to help me find my ID and boarding pass, and helped me look through my stuff. I was expecting a rude attitude since their job is just to get everyone in and out of the security checkpoints, so having one of them help me when I was so frantic was really nice. Eventually, after like 3 minutes of searching and no luck, one of the other TSA officers seemed a bit annoyed and just told me to go through and that I could print out another boarding pass. After I passed the security inspection, somehow miraculously, my ID and boarding pass was in one of the grey bins with my stuff. I'm not sure who found it and put it in there (because I def looked in my bins and through all my stuff), but I was very thankful for them and that TSA officer.

I'm shocked how well this airport ran.  No matter what the delays and problems the staff is extremely helpful.  Never have I ever had an INTERNATIONAL airport been so kind to help with every little thing.  I must say that they werethe best international airport I have ever been to.. It's designed in such a way where you don't feel like you're in an airport.  There's many coffee joints and restaurants all over.  Meaning you don't have to walk all the way back to find something to eat or snack on.  The way everything is place was smart.  Coffee on almost every corner.  Restaurants right next to the coffee places.  Carts every where to get miscellaneous things.  Bathrooms are clean and everywhere.  The floor is tiles and clean.  Everything here is clean and well rounded.
Disclaimer: I've only passed through this airport for connection flights and I've never had much of a lay over. . . It's not as big as many of the other hubs like Detroit, Atlanta and Minneapolis. But it's still big enough to need a tram of some sort. I've not spotted a tram if there is one here. The moving sidewalks just don't cut it when your connecting flight is already boarding. Many of the moving sidewalks (and there are a lot of them) weren't working, as in out of service. Even an escalator was out of service. If you've ever wondered what it's like to tote a carry on luggage up stairs, I'll inform you that it's not very fun. . . The bathroom had an attendant but the bathroom wasn't as clean as many of the other airport bathrooms that I've used. There weren't any toilet seat covers. Some airports even have the rotating plastic seat covers, so nothing at all is very "behind in the time". . . There was a food court and an area that had rocking chairs. That was a first time that I've noticed rocking chairs in an airport. I didn't use them, it was just another observation, plus I was trying to note something positive about this airport.
Nice airport that is well connected.  Not dirty and everyone was very helpful.  I feel we got through everything very quickly and did not struggle finding anything.  Has plenty of good places to eat or drink at which is a huge plus on the big layovers.
I was not real happy at this airport, there was no where to charge up my phone near my gate.  I hate to sit on the floor near the old phones on the wall and watch a bunch of people walk by.  I can't believe that an airport this busy hasn't upgraded their airport to help out those of us that are traveling and need to charge up phone and such.. . I have to stop here on my way back to Providence from ATL and really bummer by this.
Southern hospitality at its finest! I very much enjoy traveling through this airport. Security check in is usually a breeze and they have so many restaurants and shops in the gates. They are always so decked out too during the holiday season! It's a great airport to be at if you have a layover...shop, relax in a rocking chair and enjoy the amenities they have to offer.
food choices are wide in variety, airport is clean, bathrooms are nice, but it is WAY too cold in here. it's 35 degrees outside, and hardly 50 degrees indoors. it's early in the morning, people!!! either hand out some blankets or crank the heat. it's mid-december, not summer.
Charlotte Douglas Airport is one of my favorites for grabbing a connection. It is very easy to navigate, clean and well managed. I like that the terminals are fairly close together and they use a hub model for the terminal. There are many, many shopping and food options and some of them are quite good. An additional appeal is the rocking chairs that are placed throughout the walk throughs. They are a great and relaxing diversion to while away times for departure delays and cancellations.
This is by far the worst airport ever. We have went to 3 different food place to eat and have had a bad experience at all of them. The first one took over  an hour tonget our drink order then came back and said oh you have 5 minutes to order I said ok I'll take this sandwich "oh we don't have it or this or this " that was a larger portion of the menu so we said well I guess we are not eating here finished our drinks had to go ask for the check and meantime I saw our server dig in the trash for silverware and not wash his hands before grabbing food! The bk and taco place was also awful workers seemed extremely rude and bk took 15 min but the food was right there the whole time. Just don't eat here stay away avoid at all cost !
With the new American Airlines absorbing US air,all my regular flight routes have changed. Now, I find flights flying through CLT and I never had before. Had my first layover in CLT last week and wasn't impressed. I came in from an international flight which landed 10 minutes early. However, the shift for the immigration workers didn't start yet so the entire plane of passengers had to wait 10 minutes while employees showed up. Maybe this is normal in smaller international airports, but I thought it was really strange! It was really weird because no one explained  what was happening, we all just stood around and no one helped us for 10 minutes. On the positive, they do have the new immigration kiosks so things moved fast once we got started. . The airport was clean and seemed fine, so it's likely a better domestic airport. Free wifi so that's always a plus! We had a short layover and had to go straight to the gate. Not too many food options but there was an Einsteins bagels which was fast, good and relatively cheap.
I had to go from B to E, and it only took about 10 minutes. I thought that I'd have to change terminals but nope! Great shops and restaurants, very clean, easy to get around, beautiful gardens inside too
Flew two days after Christmas and there was basically one security line that took an eternity to get through. Technically there were multiple lines but we were told that one was first class & priority (Checkpoint C) and the other (Checkpoint D) we couldn't use for some other reason and we were told to go down to Checkpoint E. I had arrived at the airport with two hours to spare and ended up running for my plane. I've flown out of Charlotte dozens of times but have never seen the staff as unprepared for holiday travel as this. At least they finally have short term parking again.
For an airport, I'm impressed. It's a pretty small hub, but CLT is full of dining and shopping options. I really wanted to try the pit BBQ, but it was a little too close to my connecting flight for me to wander out to the food court. . The employees at CLT were some of the nicest airport workers I've ever encountered. Have you ever had a gate agent sincerely apologize for a delay and give real time updates on how long it would be before you boarded? I have! . On the other side of the spectrum, this airport was full of some of the most miserable travelers I've ever had the misfortune of peoplewatching. I was knocked into multiple times by people rushing to their gates, my family was given dirty looks for taking up 6 seats, even though there were 6 of us, and WOW... on our way to the gate we saw someone's dog squat right in the middle of the terminal and take a dump.. I can't comment on security since I was only here for a connecting flight.
