Stayed for a convention Nov. 10-12, 2014. . . Arrival: No one was there but us. Valet greeted us and firmly told us we could not unload there unless we used the valet parking service. He seemed stressed. I didn't want to park valet, so I confirmed we wouldn't.  I just wanted to check in, then park. . . Front desk: The woman here was NOT FRIENDLY. I tried to be light hearted and compliment the place and her. She seemed stressed and unhappy. Nothing budged her. We were the only ones at the desk. She was also VERY FIRM about the snacks being NOT free and that they were each on a weight sensitive pad which would discern if anything was taken from the tray and we would be charged. She informed us we had a room with a double and did NOT get the KING size bed we had reserved. They were "out."  Strange, because I did this a while back. We had to sleep in a double bed. Cramped. Husband and I are used to King.. . Valet: Upon returning to our car, the valet guy is gone. Still no one is here but us, so I, thinking that the issue is about crowding the drop off/registration area, suggest we just unload his suitcase and have him go up to the room while I park. Husband sees the bell trolley grabs one. Ok, so I guess we are unloading everything. And we do--fast! We load it while an apparent manager (?) stepped out of a side front door somewhere and watched with his arms crossed. But he said nothing. Just as I drove away, the valet returned. He seemed stressed, like he was under strict & direct orders to make sure there was only PAID service should suitcases be removed from the car in that area. I have never experienced those perameters before. Husband didn't want to take bell trolley back down to desk, but keep it for me to be able to leave easily with. Ok. If it had been a weekend, a busy time of month, or they didn't have enough other bell trolleys, I would have insisted otherwise. So it stayed with us.. . Room: Nice. Internet--have to pay. :(  . . Conference room:  Comfortable. Food was off the charts! The wait staff/servers/chefs were great!!  . . Other interactions with the staff:  limited, but EVERYONE seems UNHAPPY and like they are under a Nazi dictatorial regime.. . Husband had to leave separately in his car at 4 am, so I am now alone to check out.... . Checkout: After the experience at the valet area, i make SURE I am out the door at 11 am SHARP!!!!!!!!!!!  10:59, the door shuts behind me. Good!. Down the elevator with the loaded bell trolley I go. DING! At the level with parking, I get off the elevator to find a hotel staff man standing watch at a little station there in the middle of the 2 elevator banks. Never saw any before in my comings and goings the 3 days I was there. He immediately stops me and asks where did I get this bell trolley. Then RADIOS SECURITY to come check on this situation. I was so flabbergasted! He would not let me go anywhere with it. He said it was a 'SAFETY HAZARD!'  HUH? I asked "How?!" For a moment he was without words. Then said, "It might fall over on you." Really? I asked, "Because it must weight 100 lbs at the base!" So I said, "Never mind! I am not waiting for security (and to be treated like a flipping criminal!)" I grabbed my luggage and hanging clothes and left. As I lifted the last item of my things off the trolley, he radioed a new message, "Cancel security, call a bell hop to come get a trolley."  So now it's not a HAZARD or a SECURITY CALL.  All he wanted to do was INTIMIDATE ME.  (steam coming out my ears). . NOTE TO RED ROCK: YOU NEED TO GET NEW MANAGEMENT! YOUR PEOPLE HATE WORKING FOR YOU AND FEAR YOU AND YOUR NAZI REPERCUSSIONS!  Don't think for a second this is lost on your guests. WE NOTICE!!. . Next year, for the same event, I will NOT be staying at Red Rock Resort! I'd rather DRIVE 20 mins than deal with the ugly attitude there.. . *** Overlooked my special hair towel in the bath when I left. Called the next day to have it returned. Was told there was a special website for lost and found. Followed up on that, but got an email several days later saying they never found it. Really?  Bcz it looks NOTHING LIKE their towels, other than being white. Had to buy a new one.  It's ok. I got a HOT PINK one this time that will not be overlooked--even though I will NOT STAY HERE AGAIN!!!!!!
Checked it out for a day. As an architectural design and physical structure, the Red Rock is very pretty. I do like the stone and desert themes.. As a "resort" hotel however, when compared to my standard of comparison which is the fantastic Wynn Encore, the Red Rock doesn't even come CLOSE.
Whatever you do... Don't book through a 3rd party entity AND have a death in the family and have to cancel. The cancelation policy given to me at booking and the hotel cancellation policy don't seem to match up so I am being charged a $200+ cancelation fee and not being refunded. Cancelled 2 days prior to my reservation.  I would have assumed some kind of understanding might be extended. Guess not.
Great first impression, Red Rock is accessible, the cleanest and most modern of the Station Casinos in Vegas. They have just about everything you'd want in a casino.
BEST HOTEL RESORT IN NEVADA!. . The local liberal hoards (you know, the unions) can suck it with their lame protests of this spot. This is a "right to work state." Read about it. This is why we're not bankrupt like crazy union states (NY, NJ, Illinois, CA, etc....).  . . Stations has the right to be non-union. Those who disagree can patronize the union houses on The Strip and on Fremont where you get treated like a turd ready to be flushed by some 45 year liberal union wart who knows they can't be fired regardless of their attitude. Ahhh.... let me think.... no thanks. . . The Red Rock is a gorgeous place to eat, play and now shop! Big thumbs up to the Red Rock!
This is definitely the best locals hotel in Vegas by far.  They have everything one could want.  Amazing bars, eateries, concessions, gambling, and a kick ass pool.  The property is beautiful and there's ample parking.  If you're looking for a good time on date night or whatever then head on up to the Red Rock.
I used to despise this place. Partially, it was because I was a teen at the time they opened and they had a 9 PM curfew (which was sometimes enacted at 7 or even 6) which was a major no-no for a place with movies and an arcade (seeing that when I was a teen in Vegas you pretty much had no choice but to go to a casino for either of those things. The whippersnappers these days have it so much easier). But I also had legitimate grown-up reasoning for my disdain of the place too. It was a locals place masquerading as a strip joint. The service was rude and stuck up. The atmosphere was pretentious. It attracted way too many douchebags and "pretending to be rich" types. It was a giant testament to "trying too hard." . . Then the recession happened. And with the recession the "high-end locals place" thing backfired. Majorly. After this, the Red Rock hotel finally got off of it's high horse and back down to reality. The curfew relaxed. There were no more "bouncers" wandering around. Everything got less expensive. After being weary of the place for so long, it finally started to have appeal for me.. . The movie theater is one of the nicest in town and my personal go-to whenever I want to see a movie. The buffet is one of the best in town and the Grand Cafe is fantastic. Oh, and did I mention that the sports book bar has $1 margaritas year round? Because it does. . . I recently stayed in a room here, and I was impressed. The bathtub was deep and incredibly relaxing. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever laid down in. I had an amazing view of Red Rock Canyon and the pool area. It's a shamethat this hotel stay was in the winter, cuz the pool garden was to die for. Sadly, the in-room wi-fi was sluggish, which was a stark contrast from the lobby and casino wi-fi. . . Unfortunately, from a gambling perspective, this isn't a place where I have very much luck. Definitely some of the tightest slots in town (which is strange for a Station). However, in spite of the fact that I've been over-21 for a couple of years now, I really appreciate how the place isn't so antagonistic towards youth anymore. Even though it no longer applies to me either way, it shouldn't be a hassle for kids and teens to do the things that people in their age brackets typically do like see movies, play in arcades or go bowling. . . The Final Verdict. . Pros:. No longer the wannabe-Wynn monstrosity it once was.. Fantastic hotel rooms.. Beautiful pool garden.. Mid-Century, Palm Springs-ish feel in architecture and atmosphere.. One of the best movie theaters in town.. Great on-site dining.. At Downtown Summerlin's doorstep.. . Cons:. Tight slots. Can still be rather pretentious in some areas. . Crappy hotel room wi-fi.. . Return Factor: 10/10. I would love to stay in one of their rooms again. Preferably during the warmer months so I can hit that pool.
This is a really great local venue as well as a nice place for out-of-towners to come. It's a beautiful casino. Really nicely done nice things to see and has a theme feel to it.
We stayed at Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa because of the package deal from Travelocity B. found.  It's about 30 minutes from the strip, so if you have a car it's an ok place to stay.  Free parking.. . They charge a $27.99 Resort Fee.  Bogus, nobody swims in the Winter because it's outside and cold and all we got for it was a FREE newspaper every morning.  Stupid.. . They have a Bowling Alley - extra charge.  Spa - extra charge.  Regal movie theater- extra charge.. . There's 2 Starbucks, TBone a fancy looking meat place open for dinner, not sure about lunch.  Grand Cafe - meh food - we had breakfast there one time - Extra charge  $7.95 for a nasty bowl of oatmeal w/ sides like brown sugar, cherries, walnuts.  B. got a SW Special he couldn't finish.  Charged it to the Room.  They wouldn't give us a free dessert - said it was for Dinner only. Bogus.. Food court - we walked through, nothing good.. . B. did drink lots at the bar below the lobby.  He got 1 FREE drink, but he bought maybe 3-4 the whole time.. . Room: huge King size bed, TV, Tub w/ TV, and separate shower.  Separate door for toilet.  2 sinks.  Hair dryer.  Didn't have coffee pot which I really needed!  If something is missing at the snack bar let them know ASAP otherwise they will charge you for it!  Mini bar if something is missing after a few seconds - Charged.. . An ok place to stay.
I booked here based on it being a luxury hotel with seemingly good reviews.  Unfortunately this was the biggest waste of money I've ever spent.  This hotel includes nothing.  They basically charge you just to sleep there and then they charge you a resort fee of $28 per night for shit that is normally included in any other hotel.  The room was full of dust and hair from previous guests making it feel nasty as hell.  In winter, the pool was closed and there is no indoor pool.  The shuttle only takes you to the strip every 2 hours and you are not guaranteed a seat.  The shuttle to airport doesn't run early in themorning so I had to pay to get my ride back to airport on top of resort fee.  The key to the room door didn't work, pissing me off because I had to return it in person yo the front desk 3 times.  Internet in my room was slow and didn't work at least 2 days yet they charged for it.  This place is full of liars because it's website and printed materials says "complimentary" but then they charge you for it. We would have hada better time in a cheap motel that at least included a pool, gym, and free breakfast.  This place included Nothing.  They even charge you extra to use the gym.  I will never return to this hotel and I will never go to vegas again.  It was my first time visiting this place and this city..  I tried to be open minded, by not knocking it till I tried it but now that I tried it, I have no idea why anyone would ever go here.  I will never return.
First time being here. My husband and I decided to take in a movie. The hotel was nice nothing fancy. But they have a nice food court bowling alley and games for kids and a movie theater.
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #28:. Red Rock challenges the M Resort for the best & nicest off-Strip casino in Las Vegas; it's classy & glittery everywhere, and still feels like new; T-Bones may not sound like an upscale steakhouse, but it's as sleek & modern & sexy as any on the Strip; love the great mid-range restaurant choices here = Yard House, Mercadito, the cool new Hearthstone, and even Lucille's BBQ isn't bad; the central Lucky Bar looks great, as do the sexy servers in their famous plunging (both front & back) dresses; there is a best-in-Vegas 60-lane bowling alley; plus a 16-screen movie theater, huge bingo room, and large & regal conference room floor upstairs with super-high ceilings; the hotel check-in is totally separate on the lower floor, with a beautiful bar all its own; best craft beer bet = the Red Rock gets it!; not only is there the incomparable Yard House, but the restaurants (esp. Hearthstone) tend to have good craft brew selections as well
I stayed there a couple of times, rooms are nice. There's lots to do, even more now that Downtown Summerlin is within walking distance. Don't play the slots it's a loser's game. Blackjack and craps are good. They have a theater and bowling too. Plenty of ATMs just waiting for you.
way to spicy and expensive....
Red Rock is one of my favorite locals casinos. I have had he opportunity to dine, stay, play and attend parties in their ballrooms and I have never been disappointed.. . Now that I am located closer to this property I find myself visiting more often. They have kept up the property over the years and the typical aging isn't as visible here.  . . As a Stations casino they offer many local offers as well.
