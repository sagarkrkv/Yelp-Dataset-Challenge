Seriously the $60 burger is the WORST burger I've ever had. The foie was greasy and overly gamy and NOT SEASONED AT ALL! The rest of the burger was also not seasoned. I doubt that was wagyu beef - it was super dry and flavorless. Nothing about this burger warrants $60.. . The lamb burger was excellent. I ordered provolone (I think it was provolone) cheese for my lamb burger. Probably one of the BEST burgers I've ever had in my life!. . The zucchini fries tasted like nothing and I think are frozen / bulk but can't be sure. . . Service was not great. I will never go back.
I have been to Burger Bar on a number of occasions over the years and have never really been blown away by the burgers. . . On this particular occasion we were here for happy hour. Service was great from start to finish. Pleasant and extremely attentive by several different servers and bartenders. The drinks were good as well. Prices were right and I stuck with the strawberry mojito on special while my fella got a beer as well as a mai tai that he enjoyed for the most part. The happy hour food was les than stellar. The wings were probably the highlight, but they were a little dry and lacking in any real spice. The chicken tenders were sad and were similar to ones we could get at Denny's. The sliders were the least appetizing of everything we ordered. Lacking in flavor and after one bite I wasn't interested in eating any more.. . I have had some good burgers here in the past but nothing particularly noteworthy. I do remember enjoying their sides quite a bit and after a relatively lackluster happy hour we ended our meal with the cheesecake burger that ended up salvaging our whole dining experience. Not the best donut I've ever had but the combination of cheesecake and fruit nestled inside a glazed donut bun was the perfect ending to our meal.
A bit underwhelming. Everything was under seasoned, but was rich. So it was heavy on your palette but had  little flavor.. . I got the Hubert Keller burger, modified to kobe beef and smoked gouda. Couldn't taste the cheese, couldn't taste the meat, all i could taste was the steamed spinach, which was off setting.. . Quick guide:. Buffalo meat = more lean, robust meaty flavor -- recommended.. Kobe beef = Soft texture, under seasoned, very mild flavor.. . I'd try a different burger place in vegas before I return.
Great burgers , build your own has great options.  Service was great as well.The skinny fries were great and zucchini fries. Yummy.  They service is fast as well, great to eat before a show.
My first time here and I like the place. Great bar, not too crowded and  the servers are nice and friendly.  Make sure to order the Angus beef burger with baby spinach and cheddar cheese. Definitely will come back to this place.
As good as it gets when it comes to burgers. The ambiance sucks though.
Completely disappointed, under seasoned and overpriced...the Rossini did not even resemble the picture. The fries were stale and dry...all of the batter fried food were terrible...it has chunks of batter that is as hard as rocks.
This place has great atmosphere and the food is awesome.  I had the American Classic cooked to perfection.  My hubby has the Chefs Vegi Burger and said he gives it a 10.  Highly recommend this place to anyone.
Decent place, "New Vegas" pricing for food, you know, $17.95 for a Kobe burger - but it does come with fries! If I read the menu correctly, $3.95 for a soda so get the water or order a cocktail instead. Lots of beer choices and they also have a full bar. Busy place on the weekend (like almost every place on the Strip) but they do have a rather large bar (runs from the front of the bar almost all the way to the back) so if you have a smaller party, belly up to the bar for faster seating and service. . Probably worth going to at least once for the experience but a bit overpriced for me for what we received. Good service, good food, just priced higher than I expected for the food received. Hope you enjoy it if you give it a try.
I ordered the Hubert Keller burger... it was good but underwhelmed for the . $25 price.  The famous Office Burger at Father's Office in LA which is asimilarly styled burger is WAY better IMO while being $10 cheaper.
I come here quite often when I am visiting Mandalay Bay, MGM, Luxor or The Palazzo. it has a great bob and wonderful energy. Very attractive bar and wait staff. I did not try any of the adult libation as I'd already had quite a few myself..... but what I did see going past me and at the tables looked delicious...and very potent. . . A very large selection of hamburgers or at least four to five  hamburgers that can be fully customized with special breads, cheeses. bacons and a myriad of other choices. they truly wicked roster of side dishes as well....... with stand out such as spicy onion petals and everyone's favourite onion rings.. . the staff was very busy that night with an unexpected rush of people around 10 o'clock which included a table of 25 or 30. I wanted to sit at that table because there were some very handsome men!. . the interior was spotless without being antiseptic. and the Barkers must not be charged grilled because there was no smoke in the main dining area.. . if I had one suggestion it would be this.... lightly season the meat generously with both salt and coarse black pepper.. . I will so be back.
Amazing burger, one of the best I've had. Just got a cheeseburger, but the meat was thick, perfectly cooked and very high quality.  Good price for a burger on the strip ($12), amazing price for the quality.
Went there coz of all the good reviews, but I was very disappointed. Nothing special about the food here, my bf and I can barely finish it. We ordered Hubert Keller's burger, low carb burger and onion rings, all taste bleh and onion rings was way too crunchy in a hard-to-chew way. There are so much more better burger places in LA. We are spoiled. . . The only good thing in this place is service.
So glad to have gotten a chance to finally try this place. It's tempting to pass up since there are so many great restaurants in the hotel alone, but people in the group were up for burgers and it was a good option after several business meals.. . The drinks were good. I didn't go Kobe (someday, someday), but the burger and steak fries are more than enough for me. I went purist here. Even the vegetarian in the group seemed satisfied. Which says a lot for a burger bar.
My review is based on the bar and drinks only as well did not eat.  However, everything I saw looked amazing.  We sat at the bar and ordered a few beers.  Service was great the whole time.  They were very knowledgeable about the beer, which is harder to find then you would think.  They had a good selection and had several beers that are hard to find as well as some we had not tried before.  They were also willing to do some different half and half for my husband.  Also, during happy hour the prices are reasonable.. . I would definitely be back here to drink as well as hopefully eat next time.  Its also nice to be out of the casinos, so the location is good, but it is a relatively small restaurant for how many people they pack in.
It's been a while since I've been in but this was my go to place to meet a colleague of mine whenever we were both in town long enough to catch up with each other. Good menu.
An absolute must visit every time in town. Love to build my own burger and shake...it's the bombdigity!
