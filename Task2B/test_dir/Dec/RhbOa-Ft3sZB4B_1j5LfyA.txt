Expect a wait any day you go, but it's worth it! Food is very fresh and good! I had the chicken fried steak & eggs. Their sausage gravy is infused with maple syrup, the waitress mentioned beforehand that about 9 of 10 like it. I was one of the 9. The home fries were really flavorful! Highly recommend! Nice place to go & get out of the bustle of the strip!
Love this hidden little place! . The owner always greets uswith a smile and his staff are just as nice and attentive. . The breakfast is amazing (Cali omelette is my favorite, the man likes his breakfast burrito). . One of the few places that actually does the biscuits and gravy the right way-chunks of sausage in the gravy! YUM. . Word is he's changing venues to a bigger location, which is great-he needs it. Awesome seeing his family-owned business thrive!
Lots of good home cooking. I had the chicken fried steak and it was so big I couldn't finish it. It was darn tasty as well. Also had the hash browns and they were perfect.. Wife had the biscuits and gravy. It could use a little salt but the biscuits were very good. Prices are reasonable. The decor is a little "blue" but I'd go back. It was pretty busy Saturday morning.
Had a good regular breakfast. Definitely a diner, but everything tastes good and the service was good.
Food is nasty and owner/manager is nastier. He is very rude and his "minions" waitresses aren't any better. Went there last week and worst experience ever. Go to Eggs & I they have the best food!
Being a chef on the strip you get to know your food.  Thisplace is what it's all about good food, good service, super consistent
Based on yelp we headed on over as soon as my plane landed.  PEOPLE OF LAS VEGAS, THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL HERE.  The Chicken Fried steak is purchased frozen and they dunk in in the oil.  The pancakes, just plain pancakes.  The sausages not made here.  The egg, they are just eggs.  The OJ, not fresh squeezed, just purchase.. . If you can't figure out how to scramble some eggs and open an container of OJ then I guess you will love this bland, basic, store bought food.
Totally worth the wait on a Sunday morning.  . The Mama's french toast is outstanding.  The boyfriend had the California omelet, he said the home fries were the best he has ever eaten.
What's a girl to do when faced with the responsibility of choosing a breakfast joint the day after a long road trip? Yelp, and Yelp it good! I exhaustedly scrolled and read reviews. "Black Bear Diner," I thought, "Nah, it was just okay and the dishes weren't clean and lipstick stains were every where on our utensils and cups there... Oh, ooh, Mr. Mama's? What a paradox! Let's look at the photos...". . I was sold. By the ratings, reviews, and especially the photos. I texted everyone where we would meet in the morning, and on the drive there on a Sunday, the roads were clear and our GPS led us to a pretty industrialized part of Las Vegas that I've never seen before. My friend and I were earlier than three others, but we were instantly greeted at the door and our table was ready as soon as we were given menus to look at. . . The joint is bigger than you would think as they utilized their unit very well with their seating arrangements. But, wait! You don't want to hear about seating arrangements! Let's talk food.. . Our table ordered: the chicken fried steak - which had the perfect amount of gravy; greek omelet - it was very great, but I got tired of eating it after a while, but I also added bacon on the side; cali omelet - that thing is PACKED with things, I mean avocado... F'real; and french toast - which was not too soaked with butter or soggy at all.. . Overall, the experience was memorable and a pleasant way to finish a Vegas trip with my friends from all around the country. I truly recommend Mr. Mama's for their service and their fast-served, but amazing tasting food!
Not bad if you're looking for a hardy breakfast that won't break the wallet (that's already broken in Vegas!!).. . Good home cooked meals but the wait is about 30-45 minutes. That's expected when the Yelp reviews are plentiful and great! The staff was very welcoming and friendly (bumped them up to 4 stars for this).. . I ordered the gravy and biscuits which I'm not 100% sold on simply because of the biscuits themselves; they tasted kinda "broken" and not solid, almost like they were old. BUT the gravy was delicious! You can tell it was homemade and didn't make you gag after a few bites. Very light and just the right amount of flavor. My wife ordered an omelet which tasted "okaaay" however she ordered it w/o yoke and cheese; the very two ingredients I love so I cannot base it on that. . . We'll likely visit this place again one day soon and a more accurate review will be given then. But overall first impression is solid. I'm confident in recommending.
Taste: 3.5. Creativity/Authenticity: 3. Atmosphere: 2.5. Service: 3. Bang for your buck: 3. . When in Vegas Mr Mamas is the place to be; that or The egg and I depending on the line situation and how hungry you are and let me tell you both places are busy. Mr mamas feels to me more hyped with foodies and drunks coming to eat breakfast after not sleeping and partying all night. The break down. . Pros. - Food is good, the basics hash browns, egg, bacon, pancakes. - bang for you buck; this place is easy on the wallet. - Service here is for the most part good, depending on how busy it is can range per experience . . Cons. - Atmosphere, for the most part its small and loud. - parking sucks when its busy. . Overall I love this place and eat here every time i am in vegas and thats 3 times a month
Mr. Mama's was AMAZING!  Good ol breakfast,  fast, friendly service,  and the Owner is a stand up guy.  Try the French Toast!  They even have Turkey bacon which is why they get the 5 star.
As soon as you walk into this place you can already tell that this place will be delicious. I was greeted the moment I opened the door, and I knew that I would enjoy my experience here. I had the Cali Omelette and it was like the angels singing hallelujah as Isavor each bite. This place is definitely a must go to if you're in Vegas! Come early though its first come first serve for diners!
Excellent food. Nick the owner greets you at door. Even with line he gets you in quickly. Staff smiles & all work together and gets your food quickly. 4 egg Omlettes are yummy, crisp hash browns. Clean and pays attention to your needs. The place to go for breakfast & lunch. Moving to a new larger location shortly.
Great service. Mr. Mamas is very friendly. He talks to everyone. Food was a great. Need to go early as the place is packed.
Mmmm mmmm good!!! Try the Cali omelet with mushrooms instead of sausage and the cinnamon roll
We came to Vegas for our company Christmas party. We went to yelp for help looking for a place with good food and reasonable prices and came across this one. Food was good and prices are very reasonable. . . What we liked the best about this place was the friendliness and excellent service. The owner is so down to earth... Loved it! They make you feel right at home. We liked it so much we came here twice. We will be back when we come to Vegas!
Had the Cali omelet with English muffin and coffee. Great. Waitress was friendly. Would go back.
Food was great! Service was great (Denise)!!! The prices are a MUCH APPRECIATED VALUE!! Order a cinnamon roll...HEAVENLY! The owner does a FANTASTIC job facilitating the door! Very friendly place that I will definitely revisit!!
For locals, this may be a weird location to go for breakfast/lunch. On Decatur between Hacienda and Russell, it's a relatively industrial area. I went because I have been craving chicken fried steak, and this place popped up on yelp. I book marked it and visited when in the area.  . . Close to the strip, so compared to the hotels, the prices here are really favorable.. . I ordered the chicken fried steak ($10.50)-came with choice of 3 eggs (soft scrambled), potatoes (hash browns), and toast (biscuit). The gravy was creamy, thick and included not only ground sausage but bacon pieces (my waitress told me about the bacon-had she not, I'm not sure the taste was noticeable). The hash browns looked perfect (I was trying to assess whether fresh potatoes or from bag/processed-I couldn't figure it out for sure). The crust was perfectly fried and the flavor of the chicken fried steak was pretty good. The eggs did not have a lot of flavor and assumed it was carton/processed scrambled eggs. . . The Pros: . - value (good/large portions for the price). . - the owner and staff are very friendly and communicative.. - I ordered, literally, before I sat down in the chair at the table, food came out fresh and hot, 10 minutes later. . The Cons:. - the parking lot is busy/full on weekdays - little strip mall with at least 6 other businesses . - wait time can be unexpected. I went on a weekday at 11:45ish, and the wait was 15-20 minutes-the est. was right on. - the atmosphere is not great. I think overall, it felt a bit dirty.. - I sat by the kitchen door and later (after I ate half of my meal) noticed that the shelves had a lot of cans (tomatoes, beans?) and boxes (biscuit mix). I prefer when I go out to eat minimally processed/fresh/scratch made food. I can use pantry items and boxed bake mixes myself. I wondered more about how scratch made my meal was-this may seem kind of nit picky, but when you go to small mom/pop places, I think it is more likely/expected.. . Overall, my visit was OK. Would I return, maybe, but only if close by. I also would have to consider the time/day as I gather (based on other reviews), the wait time can be long.
Super fast service and excellent food. Pancakes were homemade and tasted great! Will definitely return.
My family and I are visiting from out of state and love to adventure off the strip. We came for breakfast but I still got a burger and all of the food was great and very reasonably priced. The Manhattan burger was delicious but a little on the greasy side; cooked exactly as ordered and with a good side of fries.
Just discovered this hidden gem a few months ago while at the hardware store next door.  . . Good food, good prices, friendly service - worth waiting in line for and worth just driving across town every couple of weeks.. . I love bacon and their's doesn't disappoint.  Plus, Mr Mama I assume working the door - you just don't see that anywhere.. . Good job,
I'm not sure why this place is so highly rated; the food is below average and I am convinced my mom, who doesn't cook--which the world should be thankful for--can cook better than the cooks here.  I ordered the egg sandwich with sausage and was extremely disappointed.  The sausage, which I think was supposed to be pork, tasted more like turkey sausage that was about to go bad and the sourdough bread I ordered turned out to be Texas toast instead.  I had the house potatoes on the side, which were more like fried potatoes than actual house potatoes. They were extremely salty and hardly palatable.  The only part of the meal I enjoyed was the poached eggs which was perfectly cooked and had a creamy center. . I'm giving this place a higher rating than I normally would because the staff is extremely welcoming and friendly and the food is cheap.
Nice little mom & pop / hole in the wall type place with very friendly staff, and the crunchy French toast was delicious!
Food is phenomenal, service is even better and the owner is one of the nicest dudes you'll ever meet. Always a must when coming to Vegas. It's only a few miles off the strip and its 100% worth it.
BEST BREAKFAST IN SIN CITY. . Chicken fried steak comes with 3 eggs, potatoes and toast... everything I had envisioned and more.. . French Toast made with egg bread and 2 eggs... thinking of my next visit on this side of town. . Make no mistake the greeter is the gregarious Greek owner. He's like the air traffic controller. Get that confident  feeling you're in good hands.. Best way to put it, it's the closet breakfast experiece to a must visit truck stop.
Very good!. Chicken fried steak was awesome! Not very greasy and the gravy was great!. Chili cheese omelette was not as great but still good
We were on our way home from Vegas and we wanted to get some breakfast.  We yelped some breakfast places and this one had lots of reviews so we went here.  Glad we did, because the food here was great and the service was fantastic!
I want to move to Vegas and work here. Even though they are crazy busy, everyone is calm, friendly, and extremely attentive!!! Country fried steak and gravy was out of this world. I got over easy eggs, hash browns, and sausage patties. So fresh, and I added a side of chili and smothered my breakfast. I usually feel sick after eating so much, but everything is so fresh that I felt full but great. Nick is the owner and he is the nicest man I have ever met. Jackie was our server and she was on it, but everyone works as a team. You can tell that Nick takes pride in who he hires. I cannot rave about this place enough. Go there, you will not regret it!!
Business owner was exceptionally pleasant and food quality was outstanding.The prices are great and country fried steak and veggie omelette was mouthwatering.definitely coming back to its new location that will be a bigger restaurant.
This cute breakfast spot is simple & close to the strip. Nothing fancy but the service and food was amazing. It was very crowded so to me that was a great sign that the food is probably good and indeed it was!! The owner greeted us, he is very personable and was really great with our kids. I was so impressed with the overall experience we will be back when in Vegas!! I recommend this spot to anyone looking for great service & amazing food for a great price!! Our family of 4 had the Cali omelette, pancakes, hash browns, home fries, French toast & bacon.... Every thing was delicious, no complaints!
Awesome breakfast. owner greeted us at the door and was very accommodating.  waited about 20 minutes on sunday morning at 9am. or server,  melissa, was very good,  anticipated or needs and very polite. food was awesome in all areas: price, presentation, and promptness. definitely come back here as part of our Vegas routine
Found this hidden gem here on Yelp. Food was awesome and the gentleman at the door named Nick was wonderful. All of the staff was very kind and helpful and the service was fast and good. I will definitely come back to this place next time I'm in Vegas!
We were heading home from a fun filled Vegas mini trip and was hungry for breakfast. We yelped and found Mr. Mama's breakfast joint.  It has a high rating and almost 1000 reviews so we decided to go.  I almost passed it as b/c the "Guns" signs grabbed my attention LOL.  I walked up and saw the wait.   The owner mentioned up front 45 min wait, we decided  to wait and boy was it worth it!   All I can say was   CHICKEN FRIED STEAK with that famous white gravy!  It was sooooooooooooooo freaking huge and delicious.   The huge portions and the great prices are definitely worth the wait. I like how the staff work together and share all duties. I overheard the owner stating they are moving to a larger location b/c this one only holds 54 people.   Congratulations on an awesome restaurant
The food tastes alright. The portion is rather large. The price is very reasonable.The line is long.
The owner is a total ass hole! He likes to pick fights with his customers. He personally acts as a greeter and hostess. This was my first time to this establishment and when I asked for a tble for two he put me off to ask other patrons who were not looking to be seated if he could help them. After they said no, he came to me and said "the wait is going to be 45 minutes do you want to wait?" I noticed only 2 large groups waiting to be seated so I politely asked how many other tables for 2 were before me. He rudely said "do you want to wait or not!" I said "that is why I am asking how many are before me because it may move faster than 45 min and I'll wait if there aren't several tables for two waiting." He then said "three, so are you going to wait or not!" I said yes and sat down to wait for my friend to join me. When my friend arrived and asked how I was doing I told him quietly that the host guy was unnecessarily rude to me. The owner/ host guy overheard this and approached us picking a fight with me and being extremely hostile and arguing with what I said privately to my friend. I said "you were rude to me for no reason and there is no reason for you to continue harassing me." He then said "I own this place and you need to get out!" I said "what? You are an ass hole." I was obviously confused and rebuffed by what had just occured and left. While discussing alternate breakfast plans he came outside to continue to harass me. I truly hope that any business owner who is abusive to patrons is put out of business.
Everybody and their mother must know about this place now because the place was VERY busy the day we went!!  It's a small, very casual burger joint.  Burger joint?  If you're ever in L.A., there are literally TONS of these little independent joints around.  And their specialty is good ol' homecooking.  Most of them are also Greek-owned and they have great burgers and stuff and just like this place, great breakfasts!  Although this place is more like a sit-down restaurant in that they have waitstaff that wait on you. . . The portions for most items are pretty big, but not everything.  The prices are about average.  Not really cheap, but not really expensive either.  I got the pancakes and bacon and eggs and they were great!  And of course, we got the chicken fried steak, which was big too, and also pretty good!  . . A GREAT change from the expensive stuff on the Strip.
We ate here twice while we were in LV Dec 18 to 23.  The food is good, good portions and they cook things the way you want it.  I asked for it to be "light" for my omelet with less oil and both times it came out like it.  The service was good, better the second time we visited.  Our waitress on the second visit was very helpful and told me where I could find some of the Cholula hot sauce.  There's a large menu and lunch items too if you don't want breakfast.  It was busy but things moved quickly with Mr. Mama greeting and signing people up on the wait list.
Amazing! Great food, big portions, good prices, great customer service... this place gets packed but we'll worth it
This place is amazing. You walk in and feel right at home. Decor is bright and cheerful, makes for a light and pleasant atmosphere. I was able to order one French toast and one egg. Yummy, hard to screw up though, right? Well my hubby had chicken fried steak and said it was to die for!
Written by a picky girl: this restaurant is heaven. My husband and I went every morning after we found it during our honeymoon in Vegas. Everything is delicious: pancakes, sausage, eggs, omlettes. . . Only down side: expect a 30-40 min wait regardless of what day or time you go. The resturant is supposed to move in January 2015, so hopefully they will have more room and not a long wait! It's so worth it tho! The owner Nick is so kind to everyone who comes in. We wish they would just move their resturant to California!
I LOVE THIS PLACE. I really, really, really love this place and so totally wish I couldve taken it home to S.Florida with me.. . The service was AMAZING. We walked in and were informed that the wait would be atleast 30 minutes. We considered leaving but decided to just waited out. So glad we did. Once we were seated, we understood why the wait was so long. We began withcoffee and a cinnamon bun. The bun was the size of my head... Literally. We devoured it within seconds because it was delicious and perfectly warm.. . We then ordered breakfast. I dont recall the exact name of my dish, but it was heaven on a plate. It had omelet, with pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado and cheddar cheese. All my favorite things! Probably one of the best breakfast Ive ever had.. . The food was amazing, but even more amazing was the staff. The place was packed to capacity, but the staff did not seem annoyed or hurried, but rather pleasant and charming.. . Definitely a great spot to start your day!
Busy place but, excellent service and delicious food!!! We had a party of 10. The owner was taking names for the waiting list, he was incredibly kind and courteous. Once we were seated, our waitress quickly came and took our drink orders. Shortly later, she came back to take our food order. The wait time for our food was minimal. The staff was truly courteous and attentive, without being annoying. The food was very good! Will definitely come back. Owner even remembered my name, as we were leaving!
The wait time was a little long (45 minutes) but the staff were fairly nice. I figured with the great reviews the food would be the same however unfortunately it was not. I ordered steak and eggs and should've sent the steak back as soon as I noticed it's discoloration upon delivery. Sad to say it was the worst steak I've ever had in my life. My first impulse was to get the country fried steak and by the statement of the gentleman sitting next to me, "This is thebest country fried steak I've ever tasted", I should've went with that notion.
This place is great! The wait can be a little long, but it's definitely worth it! The food is absolutely fantastic and prices are beyond reasonable. I love the California Omelet.
Months after my Las Vegas trip, I still have fond memories of this place and its charming staff. Excellent food at amazing affordable prices. Thank you for the great breakfast and we will return the next time we're in town!
We were in town for a week and we were determined to eat breakfast at a great little diner. This was probably the best place we ate at during our stay in a Vegas. . . There was 4 of us and as soon as we arrived there was a huge group of people waiting to get seated. The gentleman, whom we assume is the owner, greeted us and let us know it would be about a 30 minute wait and asked if we wanted to stay or go somewhere else. We decided to stay and the huge line in front of us dwindled down quickly and we were seated within 20 minutes tops. . . We got served coffee and it was delicious. The coffee was very smooth and it just tasted like good quality fresh coffee. Each couple ordered the cinnamon bun to share and it was huge. It wasn't the best I ever had but it was very good. . . I decided on the chicken fried steak with a side of pancakes and it was delicious. The chicken fried steak was nice and crispy and the meat was juicy. The gravy was delicious and had great flavor. The pancakes were amazing, not everyone can impress me with their pancakes but these were perfect. . . My partner and her friend both got something from the lunch menu while me and my friend got something from the breakfast menu. We all were in heaven and we all agreed that the place was great. The food is great, the service is great. If I ever make it back to Vegas this is where I want to eat at first.
Just visited for the first time while in town. Service was awesome. The owner, Nick greets you at the door and thanks you on the way out. All staff in between were friendly and efficient . The food was great!  We had pancakes, bacon, French toast, chicken fried steak and Philly cheesesteak. All were generous, fresh and very tasty!  The restaurant was very clean!  Worth the wait!
Amazing food! Owned by a Greek family so the hospitality was superb. Above and beyond. Every restaurant should take notes!  Highly recommend if your in Vegas and want to eat great food that's not pricey at all.
This is one of the best breakfast places I've been to. A great find just outside of the heart of Vegas. Low prices, wonderful service, and impeccable food. The owner is extremely friendly and sincerely wants his patrons to be happy. I highly recommend Mr. Mama's to anyone who appreciates amazing food and doesn't mind a slightly longer than average wait. Well worth it.
Busy but well worth every minute of the wait! Everyone was extremely attentive and friendly! The owner Nick takes a lot of pride in his establishment and ensuring every guest leaves happy. My Greek omelette was one of the best breakfasts I have had ever and my boyfriend loved his chicken fried steak.
On our quest for a delicious breakfast before heading home from Las Vegas, my husband and I discovered Mr. Mama's, and we're glad we did!. . I should start by saying the place is packed. We waited 30 minutes for a table, and word is that the wait is pretty standard...but it's worth it! During the wait, we had a great conversation with the owner, and we quickly saw why people were loyal to this place. He seemed like a really great guy running an honest establishment.. . When we finally got seated, we realized that the great service is universal at Mr. Mama's -- everyone was friendly, our coffee never ran out, and our food came out quickly. Not to mention, the food was just what we were looking for -- simple diner-style breakfast. It was a perfect end to our Vegas getaway, and we'll definitely be back next time we visit Sin City!
I hate walking into a place less than 30 minuets before they close. It feels so disrespectful to the staff. I found myself and a group of friends sheepishly walking into Mr. Mama's about 25 minuets before close. We proceeded to ask if it was okay. There was no one else around and presumably the staff was more than ready to go home. We were about to turn around but the owner was overjoyed and demanded that we stay because he is here to serve us. He made us feel very welcome, and genuinely happy to have us come in. . . We sat down at our table, the only one taken in the place, and got out orders taken. The breakfast menu is huge and made it quite a challenge to make a quick decision. We got some omelets, chicken fried steak, and cinnamon roles mostly because of the yelp recommendations. . . The cinnamon roles were godly. The frosting seemed to be home made and very thick. Omelets were delish, and all of the breakfast side fixings were perfectly prepared. My chicken fried steak wasn't all that extra special. I couldn't finish all of it because there was so much breading on it, that my mouth and stomach was a little overwhelmed. . . Regardless we were so happy to have eaten here for brunch. Made our bellies happy after a long Vegas night. Next time I stay on the strip I bet I come back here, just hopefully a little earlier in the day!
Great service they seemed to care for the hungry customer,  supper yummy breakfast my kids loved the french toast and i loved the clam chowder soup delicious i totally recommend this restaurant
We had basically everything on the breakfast menu and it was all delicious. The pancakes were so fluffy, the eggs were absolutely perfect, the cinnamon rollwas gone in seconds. We were seated fairly quickly for a group of 5. Our food came really quickly. We were in and out in about 45 minutes which was good. They do get busy though so be prepared. But the wait is well worth it.
Three things to say about this place. . AMAZING SERVICE . great food . And excellent price. I loved the service from the minute I walked in to the minute I walked out. Nick really knows how to take care of his customers and not to mention how friendly and nice his daughter was helping me with my order.  Being a first timer there looking for a quick and delish breakfast before heading back to Cali this was definitely a great choice. Will definitely be returning for more. . . . Oh and the breakfast burrito and pancakes are delicious ! Not to mention how great their Cinnamon roll is
Great food, great service! There's a bit of a wait, but that's probly because of the holiday season and the influx of tourists. We ordered the Mama's Burger, the spanish omelette, french toast, pancakes, and the cinnamon roll, all of which were served in large portions. The food was delicious and came with a loq price. Looking forward to coming again!
Very good breakfast.  Our whole family enjoyed it.  Owner was very friendly.  Excellent service.
We split the Western omelette. I really really wanted to like this place but sadly I just can't make it something that it wasn't. The omelette had about 5-6 small cubes of sausage and bits of mushrooms but mostly egg and green onion. The home fries were basically flat wafers of potatoes and were kind of rubbery. We ordered a side of home fries for 2.50 and honestly the side and what came with the food still didn't quite make up a great serving. People rave about the amount of food but I am but sure why. The omelette was supposed to be 4 eggs but there is NO WAY that was the case. . . So about that coffee. I could tell when I saw the waitress pour it and I could see through it like water that it was a problem. Very disappointing. Fortunately I was so cold that it just was nice to have a hot  beverage. Service was very accommodating and friendly.. . Sorry Mama but this time you struck out.
Great service and great food. Very busy and small restaurant but the service is top notch and they get you in quickly and food came out pretty fast.
