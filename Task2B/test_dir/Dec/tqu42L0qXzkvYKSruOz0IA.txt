Ellis Island has a small cafe that had great steak specials.   The only problems are that there usually is a wait and the service is slower than molasses but I still come here. . . Food: steak and eggs for 5.99? Sure!  This isn't any angus beef rated steak but for the amount of money, why not eat it?  If you like your steak a little rare inside or even medium rare, ask for rare.  Why?  They cook it two ways, well done or rare.  The rare is a little pink inside and the medium rare is where their well done starts.  Not because they don't know how to cook, just because the steak is so thin.   The Sides it comes with is usually pretty decent too.. . Service:  The service is SLOW.  I mean SUPER SLOW.  If you were waiting for your steak to cook on the sidewalk outside during the hottest day of summer in Vegas, you'd probably have a steak sooner than in this place.  They wait staff has a lot of tables to serve and they're also under staffed.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  This place is great to chill with friends while waiting for your cheap food.  It's just a thing to note if you're in a rush.. . Overall, great prices for decent food and slow service.  It's vegas and it's off the strip, what do you want?  . . I'd go back.
This is my second time at Ellis Island Brewery. The food is great. The beer is great. It's $10 cab ride from the strip. If you have more than 2 in your group, I recommend you take the cab and share the cost. If you want to burn some calories, it's a 20 min walk.  You can't find the same deal on the strip anywhere. Staff is friendly. EIB is my go to spot when i'm in Vegas.
Such big portions of food!! It was so good!! The beer batter chicken basket was bomb as hell!!! Took a little long but was worth the wait .
We found this place by accident and it was one of the places to be in Vegas the ppl there was drunk buzz and fun they had an karaoke thing going which was very fun, the bartender girl was really great she served us well and the drinks was awesome...Now the food was OK I had the steak and shrimp meal it was ok I had better...we actually went 2 nights...other than that this is mostly the place that will be on our comeback list when we visit Vegas again!!!
First of all, the prices are very nice. My brother got the prime rib and was $13.99 and came with a salad AND a beer. And of course they have the $8.99 10 oz. steak meal. Well I got the chicken fried chicken and it was the best I've ever had, and I'm from Texas, so that's surprising to me. We walked right in, service was great, 20 oz. beers were $2.00, they have unique takes on dishes (but nothing too crazy), and it's right by the casino, so you can gamble if you have to wait for a table. I wish I had this place at home, let's just say that.
I am SLIPPING!  Lived here 14 years and this is my favorite dive! I cannot believe I have yet to review it!  I bring all my out of town friends here, I refer it to all my guests' who ask where they should go.  Beer used to be $1.  I think it's like $1.50 now.  I always get wine.  It's like $3 per glass and they fill it to the top.  I believe karaoke is from 8pm to 3am.. or maybe it's 9pm.  Anyway, it's so fun!  The diner is awesome, the bbq always has a wait because it is so popular.  If you are visiting, and you love good food, karaoke, good people and dive bars, look no further!
Who doesn't love good cheap food? That's what this place is. The meals come with soup or salad I couldn't finish my chicken fried steak, I tried, cuz it was good. The half caraf of wine was 3 glasses big, the non micro brewed beer was 2.75 to me that's cheap. I would definitely come here again. It's located behind the strip off of flamingo easy to get to and there's a parking structure in the back if you cannot find parking in the front.
Beers are relatively inexpensive for proximity to the strip. Some shady characters chill here but it makes for great people watching.
Great prices on great food, but you'll have to be patient and wait for your food like everyone else. . . Staff is really kind and approachable. . . Make sure you search for coupons prior. . . Not a good place for kids because it's infested with smoke. . . Parking is okay.
Best prime rib I've had, delicious chorizo loaded quesadillas (Why is this NOT a thing in Texas?!), friendly and quick service, decent beer (only tried the amber, but liked it), and REALLY cheap, especially for Las Vegas. Heck, it was cheaper than most restaurants  anywhere for what you get. The prime rib was huge, came with a beer, baked potato, and grilled asparagus for $14! Steak and eggs on another night was $6, and the gravy with the chicken fried chicken/steak is infused with cheese, yum. The restaurant is unfortunately quite smoky (right next to the casino), but I didn't care with the food arriving quickly and being so well prepared. I'll be visiting this place the next time I'm in Vegas. Parking was easy in December, though I know that is a slow month for the area.
Las Vegas on a budget! This place is located behind the strip and is the place to go if you want food on a budget. The casino and hotel itself is not impressive... it's technically a Super 8 motel with a casino across the way. The hotel rooms are located across from the casino. The casino is small, but inside there is a BBQ place, cafe, and pizza place. . . I like coming here for the BBQ. It's super cheap... and good!! I have yet to try the cafe, but I've heard lots of good things about it also. For the BBQ, I always get a full rack of ribs and it's only $13! It comes with 2 pieces of corn, 2 pieces of garlic bread, slaw, and baked beans. The ribs are tender and tasty. They also have a half rack of ribs for $10, but a full rack is more worth the cost! They also have 1/2 ribs and 1/2 chicken or you could also get a whole chicken. I've never tried the chicken but I love ribs so much that I've only ordered the ribs! You must sign up for the players card for the lower price however because it's $3 more without a players card. Also, if you gamble $1, you will get that dollar back as a $1 coupon of any item for either the cafe or BBQ place. Who knows, that may be the lucky dollar that you win lots of money from! Trust me, because I've put in $1 before, played 75 cents and came out with $250 with a single spin!.  . The promotion for new players now is to play $10 and you will get free play in the amount of $10-$500. It's worth it because technically you aren't gambling any money but you could win money! . . There is a parking structure at this casino. It's a small structure, but I've never had trouble finding parking. I've also never had a long wait for the BBQ. Maybe I've always beat the rush! On Sundays the pizza place is 2 for 1. . . Come here for the food. It wound disappoint! I would also like to say that for such cheap food, I've never had bad service here! All the workers and servers have been friendly and the food comes out fast too!! Mmmm.... I'm getting hungry just thinking about the ribs again!! You can bet I'll be here again!
Awsome  place to catch a cheap steak and micro brew and some slotplay without going too far from the strip! Hidden gem!
This place is a cool dive bar restaurant with funky seating. On one side of the restaurant they don't serve food, only drinks.. But they didn't tell us that until we were already waiting forever to be served. Make sure you sit on the right side! . . Luckily food came out pretty quick and its delicious. They know how to fry food. Nice low key spot to fight the hangover.
This place is classic "old" Las Vegas, but where the Rat Pack would hide their distant second cousins, not "Golden Age" or old school glitzy.  It is where you'd find Clark Griswold's cousin Eddie arguing over the size of his $8.99 steak (which admittedly is smaller than you'd expect).  All in all it is not a bad off-the-strip place but the staff is crabby and the patrons are a little scary (as in staring at your own mortality scary) and the cigarette smoke is omnipotent and inescapable.  But it was my cheapest stop in Vegas and the Prime Rib wasn't bad (better than the steak looked, which my dining companion ordered).
This place is terrible. TVs everywhere but they have the same game on repeat sets. Cafe was almost empty and we still has a 15 min wait. Finally sat down and ordered out food, more that 60% of the cafe was empty, and it took us 40 minutes to get our food. Aaaand they got our order wrong.
I always go to Ellis Island once or twice when I'm visiting Vegas and make a point to stay in a hotel that is close to this wonderful establishment.  The bartender (named ROBO) that works in the bar, next to restaurant is the best and he always takes good care of us when we're there...
All you need to know is 5.99 steak and eggs special.  Yes, it is really cheap and I wasn't expecting much but it exceeded my expectations.  I thought the steak would be pretty dry, but to my surprise it was really juicy.  Your plate also comes with crispy potatoes and 2 slices of bread (I chose wheat).  If you want a delicious, but cheap meal this is the place to go.  Make sure to check out their beers also, its only 2.25 for 20oz!!!
$5.99 8oz steak breakfast special can't be beat. And the lady who served us is really nice. But the $3.89 orange juice a ripoff. C'mon, draft beer here is $2.25. Get yourself the beer, not the orange juice - I guess orange juice is just not for Vegas. :(
Good, Fresh Food.. Friendly Staff!!. Great Prices!. Near the strip too =). Cool brewery to look at =). Open 24/7
Go to the BBQ next door to the cafe serving steak. The whole rack of BACK RIB is just PERFECTION. Better than many much more expensive restaurants!!
First time here.  I tried the BBQ place, 1/2 rack of ribs and 1/2 a chicken, baked beans, coleslaw, corn on the cob and garlic bread,  all that plus their in house made root beer for $17.00.  So for the price you can't really complain. . Next time I'll try the other side of the restaurant and check out the Prime Rib.
A must on every Vegas trip.  Come here for the breakfast everything is delicious and you definitely get more than your money's worth.  . . Try to stay away at night if you want quick service.
It was the best dinner ive had there. The ambiance was great because it was quiet and late. Although you could hear the karaoke people. Lol the prime rib is delicious and juicy. The sirloin steak was phenomenal too. And nicely priced. I would definitely be returning.
5 stars this awesome 24/7 cafe in an old Vegas casino. My table was clean, they had hot tea and honey, and the waitress let me custom order my veggie breaky sandwich (which came out delicious and not at all greasy!). Also the breakfast potatoes were very tasty! Great service and good inexpensive food at 6am..I give this a major thumbs up!
We got the lunch special (a small steak with fries) and it was OK. . They cooked the steak perfectly (medium rare) but it was very hard to chew, flavorful but tough meat. The french fries came kindda cold and the service was not very helpful.. Seems to me she was very busy, because we had to ask for straws and water refills several times until we got the 1 refill.. The beer was fantastic, both the stout and the other one ;-)
What can I say? This is a true Vegas gem! . Never had a bad experience here. . $2 20oz beers, $1 during football games. . $10 minimum purchase with card. . Happy Hour menu is not shabby. . You'll meet lots of locals, and folks who are just passing by and overly excited for discovering Ellis. .  Karaoke after 9pm at the bar near the front entrance.  BBQ restaurant in the far back corner (not connected to the cafe) next to the Sport Bets. . Service is always fast and friendly! . . Douchy folks, STAY AWAY!
