I always enjoy exploring the entertainment venues of Las Vegas, from the major properties on the Strip to the historic older casinos, bars, and restaurants.. . This review is based on a family group going to see the resident Cirque de Soleil Beatles "LOVE" show at the Mirage the day after Thanksgiving.. . Street access to the complex from Las Vegas Boulevard is simple and straightforward.  I dropped my elderly passengers off at the front entrance of the hotel/casino among a throng of cabs, shuttles, and limousines.  Getting back out to the street and re-entering to go to self-parking went smoothly in spite of the exceptional level of both automotive and pedestrian traffic on Black Friday.  I found the self-parking facility convenient and easy to navigate.  The walk back to the main lobby from there is surprisingly short, including an elevator ride, an open-air bridge, and an escalator ride.  Self-parking is free of charge.. . The casino facility is typical, with everything from "penny" slots to dedicated high-stakes areas.  Beverages at the lobby bar are pricey but normal for any major venue on the Strip.. . The show is a huge engineering production incorporating multimedia, a highly dynamic stage, and of course Cirque de Soleil's incomparable displays of acrobatics, dance, and special effects.  There are no animals and no clowns, just some of the finest human talent you will see anywhere with fantastic costumes and innovative props.  The interpretive show provides a powerful review of the enduring influence the music and art of The Beatles has had on our music and our culture.  I found it very moving, and was surprised at the level of familiarity with the music shown by my mom and her siblings (I' m 56, she's 80.). . I walked out of the Mirage with a big grin on my face and some of my favorite songs playing in my head.  I would definitely like to see "LOVE" again - There is so much going on both on stage and all around that you can't take it all in during a single viewing.  And I would certainly consider staying at the Mirage's hotel should an opportunity arise.
"Please note that we will need to shut off both hot and cold water in our rooms between 11pm and 4am" what? I don't even understand what that means and if it's even possible to do that at a full service hotel- let alone one of the biggest hotels on the Vegas strip! I called and ask what will happen if I need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and the response was- sorry.. You won't be able to flush until the morning. I am speechless. First and last time staying here.
The Mirage is an older casino that is still nice but is a little bit dated.  The location is outstanding and the gaming good. The check in can be long and tedious and they add a "Resort Fee" to your bill.
Very disappointing stay.  First, we went to CPK & couldn't get drinks because the bar was broken. Then, the fan in our bathroom was incredibly noisy and the TV broke.  Then, they shut off the water from 11pm to 5am.  When it came on - there must have been something in those pipes because had bad allergies from it.  If it hadn't been for the engineer fixing the TV so fast & the great massage I got at the spa, this stay would have been a complete loss!  Enough places there that I will definitely be staying somewhere else in the future!
Overall nice hotel and casino. Staff is friendly and really going out of his way to take care of you. Poker room staff was nice as well.. Major con: Wifi!. Impossible to get a decent coverage nowhere in the hotel. Not in your room nor in the casino. If you have a limited data plan, you're screwed.
This place is the center of the Strip.  Plenty to do there and walking distance any where.
Stayed here twice so far. this past experience was not as good as the first. I had some difficulty getting some necessities  they were a bit busy and I get it. The place had some nice amenities and was very comfortable. Overall this is a great hotel in a very busy area of the strip. Check out the volcano. Truly breathtaking
Clean rooms and grounds. . . However doors are very thin, closet type doors. You hear everyone's conversation especially if you're next to rude oblivious people who think they're the only one in the hotel. Nice view of the strip but comes with a price of hearing the volcano erupt every 30 mins. House keeping did not service our room, very disappointed with that. We came back from a long walk, I was expecting a tidied room for the price I paid for. . . We will stay elsewhere next time.
I did not stay in a room at the Mirage... This review is about the casino in general during a concert. . . I went here for a free concert during NFR. There was little to no organization on the concert floor. They allowed too may people to cram into the tiny space where the concert was held. I watched someone almost get lit on fireby a cigarette because they allowed someone to smoke during the show. . . The security staff was not well prepared for any unruly people. To girls jumped up on a box to dance and while one security uard grabbed her foot to get her down, the other one pushed her other foot causing her to go down, just not the way they were hoping. She hit the floor face first. Granted... she was kicking them and ignoring their warnings. . . The sound for the concert was good.
Had a lovely stay at the Mirage. Decent rooms, good food and restaurants, relaxing spa with an Amazing massage, Fun Times!
We stayed 4 nights at the mirage and had a terrible experience beginning to end. We arrived on Sunday 12/14 only to find their parking lot full to the top due to two big events at the hotel, a cheerleading championship and a rodeo event. It took us 45 minutes to find a spot and it was on the roof ( 8th floor ). At the front desk, we were warned about the mini snack bar in the room, They told us that it had sensors and that any thing we remove will be charged to the room even if not consumed. We had kids with us and were constantly making sure they did not remove any candy bars or other items from the snack bar so we wouldn't be charged the outrageous prices for the items inside ( $3.50 for M&M, $5 for five hour energy etc.,,). Our room had no fridge but we were told that they could arrange for a mini fridge for $25/day. Really? we stayed in December but what would anyone do in Vegas in August without a mini fridge inside the room? The lady at the check-in desk also failed to mention anything about our $50 food and beverage credit which was supposed to be part of the booking package from the Mirage website itself. We had to remind her and she seemed rather disappointed that we mentioned the credit. . We called housekeeping and requested extra bath towels for the kids but our request was ignored and we had to call again the next day to get the towels.. The bath tub was slow draining and needed about 5 minutes after the shower is done to drain all the water..!!!. The cocktail servers at the casino were extremely slow and generally a no show on the casino floor.. Here is the worst part: The hotel emailed us a bill on check out day with a full charge from the buffet not factoring the $50 food and beverage credit. We had to call the front desk and remind them with the credit and that's when they re-sent an email with the correct bill.. Finally, WI-FI was terrible. Comes and goes momentarily. We called the front desk and were transferred to the tech person who insisted their WI-FI was not at fault.. So here we go: A hotel that will nickel and dime you by having a snack bar to sell you overpriced crap, instead of a mini fridge to make your stay more pleasant. Oh wait, you can get mini fridge for extra on top of the resort fee that you pay for the crappy internet and the crappier housekeeping.... On top of it, bad billing and accounting practices and thin room doors and walls.... No thanks. Mirage. This was our first stay and would be the last, We will take our business elsewhere....!!!!
The hotel is really good, the rooms are clean and there is this feeling of freshness... It's in the center of the Streep and the Beatles show is in Mirage; friendly staff, huge casino area and lot's of places to eat :) The only thing I do not like is the noise I was hearing during night time when people were coming back to their rooms. I would come back to Mirage though...
I stayed here a couple of times and visited the hotel a number of times. The rooms are decent but no frills. Soon I am sure they are due for another renovation as you can tell the rooms have wear and tear. They seem to have a lot of restaruants on premise but none of them are especially exciting.  I do like the center atrium when you walk in.  All and all not the most fabulous hotel in vegas but definitely decent. Room prices are very reasonable.  Good central location on the strip. Easy access to just about anything.
Again, love love love M Life resorts.  Went to see CIrque de Soleil Beatles LOVE show. Got tickets for $125, second row and a concert, play, and circus in one definitely get your money's worth!. . The lobby area for the show is very nice and colorful.  Mirage hotel is beautiful a bit big and you will get a little lost but every hotel on the strip is massive!
The check in process and everything went smoothly. As soon as I opened the hotel door, I was impressed because it was nicer than I had expected until I stepped into the bathroom to wash up before going out and spotted hair in the bathtub. SO GROSS! I know for certain it was not mine or my friend's because we both have longer hair than the hair found in the bathtub. I immediately called housekeeping and they said that they would send someone up immediately to clean the bathtub. One hour and 5 more phone calls later, I was fed up. Every time I called, they replied back with "Someone will there in ten minutes". Are they playing games with me??! . I called the front desk and requested to speak with the manager. She empathized with me and told me that she will get back to me soon. Turns out that housekeeping also said ten more minutes and she told me to wait until 11:17pm and the minute housekeeping was late, to contact her back. I gave one star for the manager, . They literally came the second it turned 11:17. A lady came in smiling and it seemed like she cleaned the bathtub as the hairs were gone, but the second the shower turned on, the hairs appeared. It seems like the housekeeping lady just moved the hairs into the cracks and made it just look like it was gone? -_- Are you kidding me? At this point, I just cleaned the hairs myself because I was running so late. I never want to stay here again. If their housekeeping works like this, I cant imagine how dirty the entire room would be. Maybe they just sweep everything into the cracks and hide all the trash and dirt. GROSS!!!!!!
Great place to party & vacation w family. Food is great. Service is amazing. The pool is open & heated 80 degrees. Wow . Awesome . We love Vegas , mirage service & staff...try it
Not a secure place....used ATM there and got identity stolen.  This was the only place we used our card.  After contacting the Mirage....they said "what do u expect us to do about it"?  Really...that's how much ucare about ur patrons.  Won't be back after that!  They wouldn't even help with a police report.. . Terrible consideration!
coffee maker, ,5,no coffee maker and room service won't give you one, so you have to pay for hot water, $5 a thermal bottle. I guess that is how they make money considering that the hotel fee is low. No kids menu in any restaurant.
My experience at the Mirage was not that great.  The room was not that big and the view they gave me stunk for being a player cards, well I guess M-life member now.  Not trying to say that I am a high roller, but I spend a good amount of money at the casino.
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #27:. happy 25th anniversary to The Mirage!; you gotta love the foliage, waterfalls, & lagoons - both outside and near the lobby; the giant aquarium behind the hotel check-in counter is also a nice touch; there are some seriously cool dining spots here - I especially like the sexy modern look of Japonais and Stack, located next to each other; there is a sprawling and classy conference room & event center area; I'm not even going to mention the outdoor volcano, since that is more for the tourists walking on The Strip; this is a classic 3.5 stars place, but I'll round up since The Mirage started all of the development of upscale Strip casinos, back in the day (1989); best craft beer bet = nothing outstanding, but BLT Burger has the best overall selection; the sports bar and Tom Colicchio's aren't bad either, but the best tip might be to buy a 22 oz. Samuel Adams bottle in the sundries store for less than $7.
Love staying here with all the amenities and cool places they have to eat and hang out. This is the perfect spot on the strip as it's centrally located but easy to stay in all day if you want.. The tables are fun and entertaining and the nightlife goes on all night (unlike some other strip hotels that seem to close up around midnight or so).. The crowd here seems to be mostly young and hip and that also makes it more fun than hanging out where most of the players are old or drunks (lol - it's vegas - it does happen).. When we stay here we always eat breakfast at Carnegie's and usually eat at least once at CPK just since we want to eat at the raised up platform - hahahhaa.. Rooms are nice and big and are always clean.. Get into a suite if you can - they sleep about ten people and are bigger than my house!!! sheesh! Talk about living it up! You can do it HERE!. :)
Wifi sucks. Don't go here cuz wifi really sucks. Beatles is good. Food sucks. Casino sucks. Everything smells like cigarettes. It's hella dark. It's basically a rat hole with poo everywhere. Go to Lake Tahoe. Go to San Francisco. But the mirage is for old people struggling to have a meaningful life. Like my dad. There are young people cuz it's like pretty cheap. Idk. Dude it sucks. Hate the whole "I gotta pay $200/night to secondhand smoke the cancer sticks all day". Got a bunch of hobos down the street. Why do people go to Vegas? To find a perfectly good reason to flush your life down the toilet? I'd think so. In my humble opinion, my tendency to come up with suicidal thoughts rose over 9999% while staying in the Mirage. Please don't waste not even one moment staying at an expensive garbage room with wifi that sucks. Basically wifi really sucks.
Very helpful, great service.  Helped me with the ATM as I am disabled and in a wheelchair.  All staff and rooms were very handicap friendly.  Beatles "LOVE" show is a delight, feel good show.  Enjoy the new "Pantry" restaurant, homemade jam decent prices for the taste and large portions.  "The Secret Garden"  offers guest an amazing green retreat, that is wonderful for children.  Knowing the animals and Dolphins have large enrichment centers behind the public viewing areas should put all animal activists complaints to rest.  The felines were featured in shows and enjoyed acting so they still do their acting behind the public areas in the enrichment centers.  What the public sees is only a small part of the animals have been provided as a home.Between the Beatles "Love", the "Secret Garden" and the beautiful pool, with waterfall, not to mention the dramatic volcano, children and adults will have a wonderful time!
I had a terrible experience there and I WILL NOT EVER go back to this hotel. This hotel DOES NOT deserve  4 stars! . This is my fault! I had heard from several friends that this is not a clean hotel and the  management is not good, but I didn't listen!.  . The rooms are not cleaned properly! Here is my experience. We had two rooms and each room had its own problem. One bathroom was full of hair around the bathtub and on the wall and stain on the counter while my room had an issue with dirty sheets. Upon arrival I found out that there were a whole bunch of black spots on the sheet so I called and asked the sheets to be changed and they came and changed the sheets. So I went out at night and came back late exhausted to find out that right bellow my pillow there were nasty looking redish spots! and torn sheets.... I was so mad and I called and since it would take a long time to change the sheets by a maid, I just got a sheet and covered the stain. The next day, I went down and talked to the manager and they promised to have an inspector checking the room and take care of the matter. Well, the sent an inspector..... So, the next night, I went out with my friends and came back to find out the sheet was NOT changed! Are you serious???????!!!!! The inspector checked the room! How is that possible???? I had to do the same thing again and called for clean sheets.... . I was furious! Thank God we were checking out from that hotel the next day! They tried to compensate by giving free lunch at the their buffet, but no way I will come back to this hotel....
After an impromptu decision to flee with the kids to Vegas, we ended up choosing the Mirage. The price was quite reasonable and it's location ideal for walking the strip. Once we checked in we went up to our room. The rooms are immaculate and the hotel supplied toiletries, towels and bedding to accommodate the 4 of us. We've stayed at hotels before where we've had to make several requests for such items. . ~Our kids loved the volcano show. . ~The restaurants at the hotel were decent. We ate at Carnegie's deli and BLT burger in lieu of the buffet for dinner. . ~The buffet at the mirage is AMAZING for the price. They even give you a AAA discount at the buffet, which is 20% off. . Overall, a stellar experience for the price and class of hotel. We would most definitely stay again!
