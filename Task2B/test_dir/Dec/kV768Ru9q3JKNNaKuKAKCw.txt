This is the best of the cirque du soleil shows. I've seen all of them and I have to put this on top. Most of the is  on water. And the stage is incredible. That's what I like about Vegas hotels,  they never go cheap and spend maximum dollar to make everything perfect to satisfy the consumer. Must see
As a working actor and member of Cirque du Soleil - O since 1994, I have seen and participated in numerous classes, workshops and acting schools. I can honestly say that if you are looking for a place to focus your comedy chops, this is the place to do it. After taking a few years away to be a parent and raise my 3 kids, I was looking for somewhere to shake off the rust. What I found was a place to not only shake off that rust, but a place to put a fine polish on my comedic skills. Todd Rohrbacher has a gift of pinpointing the heart of what is funny in scripted material and shows you how to do the same consistently.
Birthday week in Vegas for my wife. This was the top rated show on yelp in Vegas. It didn't disappoint. . . It cannot be expressed in words the experience you have watching this show, but I'll try. . . The sights, lights, music and synchronization was unbelievable. Everything from the dancers to the seats were perfect. . . All I can really say, is no one who goes to this show can be disappointed, unless you have no soul. . . If you are in Vegas, you HAVE to see this show. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Do yourself and your loved ones a huge favor. If you don't care about your loved ones take them to see Chris Angel.
6 years ago I saw this production on a family vacation to Vegas (yes there are some family things that can be done). We didn't have the best seats, however, what we did have allowed us to share in the experience of the show. This has no real story line which makes it accessible for everyone to just enjoy the art without having to think about the plot too much. After all it is Vegas where no one really thinks about the plot to things. I loved the lady dressed in black and white that looked like a clock.
Beautiful cirque show. I was fortunate enough that this was my first cirque show and it was absolutely impressive. The vocals, the music, the acrobats, the visual effects, everything was phenomenal.  If you are going to see one cirque show, this is the one to see. The choreography is just amazing considering how much of it was in the water. Grab a cocktail and enjoy the magnificence.
Amazing, fantastic,  extraordinary, very engaging, greatest Cirque du Soleil in vegas is the "O" show. From the first minute till the last second just perfect.
I watched a few Cirque du Soleil shows but "O" takes it to a whole new level. It just left me speechless! I highly recommend going while in Vegas!
Im going to be honest, i had NO FLIPPING idea what was going on!. . but it looked cool as hell, i say its an assault on your senses. prob wouldn't pay to watch it again though.
We really enjoyed this show but I made the mistake of cheaping out on the seats.  I went by the rule that most seats are great at Cirque shows.  It didn't apply for this show, the balcony left or right doesn't allow for full enjoyment of the show.  The divers/gymnasts and costumes were fantastic as usual although I recommend La Reve over "O".
My daughter is a diver and this has water and diving...I thought this was a perfect fit.  We were not disappointed.  I think they could do a much better job explaining what the story was...we all walked out of there asking.."what the hell did we just watch"?  The stunts are spectacular and funny parts were cute.  There was so much going on it was impossible to catch everything.  The gymnastics and acrobats were amazing.  Definitely a great show for the whole family.
