What an experience this evening was for me and my colleagues! I wanted to go to this restaurant because quite honestly it is always in the gossip magazines as the celebrity hangout. I had stopped by last year for a glass of wine but had never gone for dinner until last week.. The entrance is absolutely gorgeous with two rows of what looks like baths filled with roses. It has a low light vibe to it and a gigantic Buddha that stands from ceiling to floor in the center of the restaurant. Ambiance is fabulous.Bring a light so that you can read the menu though! . Our server was Lawrence who was an absolute delight from beginning to end. Great humor and a lot of fun. I recognized him from an unfortunate episode on the Kardashian's reality show. Lovely lovely guy. . We started our meals with an array of delicious appetizers. The standout was the Lobster wontons with shitake ginger broth. My friend and I practically licked the bottom of the bowl. Unbelievable. . Two of my friends ordered the steak which they both LOVED. The steaks came with three huge and gorgeous onion rings. Great presentation. My other friend ordered the sushi which was a hit as well. The entrees didn't hold as much interest to me as the appetizers so I "settled" on the coconut fried shrimp with spicy Thai peanut sauce. I asked if I could get it not fried but told I couldn't. I think it is because of the volume of guests they have each night. Disappointing as I would have been perfect if not fried. I was only able to eat two of them before it was just too much. I felt such a waste to leave all that food. The portions are very generous. . We finished the evening by sharing an order of the sugar coated doughnuts that came with vanilla and dark chocolate sauces and a caramel one as well. My one friend would not stop talking about them so even though we were full we had to at least try them. Again we licked the bottom of the plate!! What a fabulous way to end the meal.. The food and the ambiance were both outstanding. To top it off though was the service. Everyone we interacted with was just so friendly and professional. Special shout out again to Lawrence our server. I did stop Dave (another server) at one point and he graciously took care of getting some sauces for me for the shrimp - at no charge and with a smile. I found the fact that the service to be so good of somewhat of a surprise. This is basically a tourist place and so I wouldn't have great expectations for the service and the fact it was exceptional makes this place even more special.
Easily one of the coolest restaurants I have ever been to!  The atmosphere is incredible!  The food is outstanding and the drinks are phenomenal.  We went for my 30th birthday and were able to share the majority of the food items. This place is a fusion of everything that is great about Asian food!  We got outstanding sushi, incredible eggrolls, delicious duck fried rice, fabulous duck lo mein, fabulous crusted filet, mouth watering seabass, and the giant fortune cookie for dessert which was one of the most unique and creative and delicious desserts I have ever had.
Meh, there are 21 better sushi/Asian bistro style places in Vegas. Half of them are cheaper. Go there instead. Tao is ok, but their prices suggest they're better than that. Idk, maybe I'll go back and try again. Maybe I'm getting old...maybe I don't "get it"....3 stars.. . Oh and after reading other reviews, I'm reminded that yeah their drinks are expensive. Ready? I ordered a ciroc and soda x2 , and 2 ciroc martinis (Cuz I love p Diddy) and then closed that tab, total cost $74 , I was kind of surprised. Water next time.
I love this place. . Best sushi in town. I would recommend Omakase dinner.
Fantastic ambiance! Staff was incredible. We got a must have appetizer which was the lobster wontons. Pure genius! We then shared the lobster pad Thai. Plenty to share. Lots of lobster.
I've been to Tao on three different occasions and it's hands downt he best meal I've ever eaten. I get the soy ginger glazed salmon that's on a bed of udon noodles with satueed spinach. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The flavors are bold and all go well together. The salmon is perfectly flaky. The miso glazed chilean sea bass is runner up. I've also tried their sushi and it was good, but nothing beats the soy ginger salmon. This place is very classy and has friendly, attentive service. The art work is very interesting and there is a large buddha upon one of the walls. I would recommend this place to anyone that goes to Vegas.
Nice restaurant! Cool asian fusion a-like. . . The ambient is fantastic, very nice, with a club upstairs. . . Good food and nice service!. . The 'hot edamame' is ok, but the shrimp is superb!
Food poisoning. When you spend 250 bucks on a meal you'd expect a certain level of sanitary conditions. I feel more confident about the hole in the wall cat hunters. Gf was throwing up all day.
