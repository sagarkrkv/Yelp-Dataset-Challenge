Four Peaks is the ultimate dining location.  With the combination of amazing beers and well crafted cuisine it is impossible to leave without thinking of when you will be back.  On top of that it has an atmosphere second to none.  The staff is very friendly and the actual building is an awesome old farm house.  One of the coolest features is the dining and bar areas are right next to the brewing vats.  You really cant go wrong.
This is a really great place to sample some beers! I did get the sampler and managed to try eight different beers which was great as this is a brewery. While I'm not much of a beer drinker myself I can definitely appreciate the time and effort it takes to make great local brews. I also ordered the fish & chips which were quite good. Not the best that I had but it's up there. The bartender asked if I wanted to try some seasonal brews which I was surprised about but was glad to try them.. . The atmosphere is pretty cool but I'm not sure how I like that industrial feel to this place, then again it's a breweryafter all. Service was decent even though there are a lot of younger bar and wait staff here, not that it matters because it seemed like they were doing a pretty good job.. . Parking situation here is a bit tough but luckily I came at a slow time so it was easy to find parking and be served fairly quickly.
A number of people told me this was one of the better breweries in Phoenix area and was one of the first. I also kept seeing their beers other places while in town so I made sure to get by and check it out. I was not disappointed, cool bar environment and great selection of food and in house beers. I did a sampler and had a Pumpkin Porter. The porter was probably my favorite beer out of all of them. But they had a number of good beers. Definitely check this place out if you like craft beer.
I love this place. Best place in Tempe! Apart from drinks chicken wings are the best here :) Ofcourse the beer-battered fries as well.
First time here and found it on YELP and it paid off.  From service, attitude, environment, food and beverage everything was excellent. Awesome experience all the way!!
This place has my favorite Hefeweizen... Period. Also the Salmon BLT is unique and delicious. Great find!
Love the food, service and atmosphere!! Even the wait isn't bad because you can grab a beer and hang around. Always go for their specials, the kitchen always puts in extra effort for these dishes!
One of the best local brews I have been to.  Love the food (surprisingly good for a "mirco brew").  Only one better is Stone brewery in Cali.  The food and service are all top notch.  Its cool they have the bar mixed in with the vats they make beer in, to remind you where it comes from.  Right next to college area so its always packed and parking is a pain.. . O ya, the beer is amazing as well :)
Food here is very good.  Atmosphere busy and fun .. Dining among brewery tanks is always cool.  I know I'm in the minority .. But I think the beer Is just ok.. I had the Raj IPA and it was .... fine.  I have had many Sunbrus, 8th Streets .. The Pilsner when they have it .. And they are all ......... Just ok.  Sorry.. There are breweries in the Valley (Litchfield Park Tap Room, Arizona Wilderness) making beer much better than this.  Granted they are smaller batches ... I guess that's the difference.. Four stars for Four Peaks ... It's a lot of fun with good food and okay beer.
With 1200+ reviews and 4+ stars how can you go wrong?. Excellent and attentive service who's have great communication. Their beers are decent to great and you can sample to find the right one you want. . Great vibe, fun decor with flags and Christmas lights but not so loud you can't make friends and have great conversation. . Excellent nachos and the Carne Adovada is not to be missed if you can only visit once.. They also have great daily specials including the Elk Oso Buco which is delicious.
I love the location, and atmosphere of this place.  I've been dining and drinking here for fifteen years.  Recently the service hasn't been amazing.  However, the food is still decent, and the beer is still satisfactory.
This is a "you just can't go wrong" type of place. A local favorite, for sure. Great beer and awesome food in a very cool place. Sure, the parking can be a bit of a pain but, who cares.. . Lunch, dinner, happy hour, it's all good.. Some of my favorite menu items are the Green Chile Mac & Cheese, any of their burgers, the grilled chicken beer bread and the Salmon BLT is *really!* good.. Seasonal beers like the Pumpkin Porter and the Odelay Mexican Chocolate Ale are some of the things legends are made of. If those aren't in season, my favorites are the Oatmeal Stout, Raj IPA and the good ol' Kilt Lifter.. . As a bonus, the guys from Four Peaks do a lot of cool things in and for the community.. Everyone loves Four Peaks...
This is probably as good as it gets for a beer lover.. . Four Peaks has an excellent patio so you can relax and unwind with a drink after a long day.  The place is gigantic, so there's rarely a wait.. . The beers are delicious.  I had the Peach Ale and the Hef, and both were awesome.. . Their servers are very friendly.  Ours brought by a couple of free samples to see what we'd like best.. . ENJOY!
Love this place. I don't even drink and I definitely will go here if anyone suggests it. All of their beer is brewed in house and their water is even filtered so it doesn't taste gross. My favorite there is the margarita pizza. It's the only place I will order this.
I'm a fan of their beer and it's even better on draft! We ordered their fish and chips and grilled chicken beer bread. Both were very filling but delicious! The food came out pretty quickly and our bartender was always there when we wanted another round.
Great beer. Great food. Great service. I ordered a delicious lamb burger which included  spinach, tomato, red onion, crumbled feta, and tzaziki sauce in between parmesan crusted toasted foccacia bread. This place can be family friend or a great place to unwind after work. I highly recommend happy hour! $3.75 pints and  $13 pitchers.
It is true what they say about the nachos. They are quite delicious.  This is probably this best bar restaurant in Arizona. They have a lot of food options and they are all good I hear. They are a Vikings restaurant too so bonus points for that. Go Vikings! Everyone is very friendly. Parking is kind of a bitch, but whatever it is worth it. TVs everywhere is nice too.
This place is conveniently located inside the airport. It is an excellent stop if you are looking to grab some breakfast or even a beer early in the morning. . . The service is excellent and they also try their best to feed you so you can make your flight. I definitely recommend their beer soup. It is delicious!
This place was awesome!!  Went there with my wife and 3 kids and NO ONE had anything negative to say.  The manager stopped by to introduce himself and then again to check on us.  Server was very friendly.  Beers were delicious, my wife even enjoyed one after our server brought her a free taste of a couple to choose from.  We ordered a variety of things from a sandwich to pizza to pretzels and all shared.  As I said, no one had a complaint about anything.  Everyone was happy!  I was a little worried about a brewery with kids but it was fine.  We will definitely be back.
