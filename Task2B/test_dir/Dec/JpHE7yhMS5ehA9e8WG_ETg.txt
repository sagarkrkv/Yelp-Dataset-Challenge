I have to say after staying here a few more times I've grown to like this place. It sure beats Vdara, MGM, and all of the other mlife hotels on the strip. . . I really like how the Valet is close to the guest elevators. I hate walking a mile like most other hotels to get to the room. . . I like the controls next to the bed. I really hate getting up to the wall to close the curtains and blinds. I can also set an alarm to open curtains automatically at a certain time. . . Started gambling here more often and got the winter rates for $79 a night. I think for that price it really is a good value. . . Will be staying here again in January '14 so looking forward to this. Hopefully next time I can move up in Mlife tier.. . Food here is pretty good too and the smell of smoke isn't too bad.
First time staying at a hotel where nobody came to clean the room, and I even told staff today that I was leaving the room, so it was available.  Very poor service, because someone had to know the room wasn't cleaned.  . Nicely appointed room otherwise.  Tomorrow I see if they go two days in a row without room cleaning.
$25+tax RESORT FEES per day.. . Even a motel offer FREE wireless Internet, gym, pool, newspaper, boarding pass printing!  . . The low advertised rates are misleading because of the hidden resort fee + 12% Tax on room rates (standard?). . Self parking folks have to walk across the casino to the guest elevator.  I believe every Vegas hotel is designed that way to entice you to gamble.... . Regarding the room, overall the room looks very nice and modern. I love the goodnight button and electric curtains. Bathroom is spacious, big tub with shower on the side was a plus.  However, the mattress was way to soft, didnt get much good rest because of it.
My favorite part about this hotel was their pool. But I love pools in general... Their pool side service is great. I would definitely order their pina coladas. They give you a massive amount and therefore it takes longer to melt in the hot summer sun.
Room is nice, great view if you're high enough. The buffet is pretty good. But there's something inherently greedy (and tacky) about a place that charges you $25 to rent a fridge for your room because you're not allowed to store your own stuff in the minibar fridge. Not to mention the 60-second rule that has you getting charged for items if you don't put them back in the right place in time.. . Get a room outside the strip, drive to the hotel of choice and let them valet your car for the price of a small tip. Put that extra money into your entertainment.
Have stayed here a few times over the years and its always a first class operation.  The check in is smooth and generally faster than other resorts.  The rooms are large and have a full wall window that brightens up the room if you like or you can push a button and close the motorized drapes. For my first stay, I was somewhat amazed when the curtains opened automatically and soft music began to play as I entered the room, triggered by my room key.  The bathrooms are nice and large and the bed is very comfortable.. The casino has the usual variety of gaming with high minimums on the tables.  The air filtration system is excellent in the casino and isn't smoky at all.  The Aria is a nice place to stay if you're looking for a premium hotel in Vegas.
Stayed here several times. It's clean it's new and always smells good. Rooms are nice and modern. Inside the casino lobby very modern with great restaurants and bars. I recommend it highly.
My boyfriend and I recently stayed here for my birthday weekend (11/29). I had an amazing time. The hotel is magnificent, the staff is friendly, the food is fantastic, the drinks in the lounge are strong, the rooms are clean. A few things, 1, we stayed here Wednesday-Monday and 1 day it took ALL DAY for our room to get cleaned, we had the service light on, we left, we came back, we called and asked for a complete room clean (making of the bed, trash emptied, new towels, the whole works) NOTHING, we called again FINALLY housekeeping arrived and we just asked for fresh towels and the trash to be emptied. 2, the pool hours, why is the pool ONLY open from 9am-5pm, I only got to use the beautiful hot tub one time, I was too busy running around enjoying the Vegas life. I feel the hotel should extend the hours during the week or at least the weekends, maybe 5am-9pm, just something to think about. GREAT GREAT GREAT hotel, minor issues. I would stay here again.
We thought the Aria was beautiful on the outside. When we arrived before check in, our room was available so we were able to check in early which was very convenient. The room was nicely decorated and bed was very comfy...but that may have just been because once we finally laid down we were exhausted from the Vegas fun! However, we were greatly disappointed with the paper thin walls. We could hear everything our neighbors talked about, when they left and when they returned to their room. A hotel that cost this much could have more sound proof walls. Upon check in they ask you the names of people staying in your room, nice job trying to call customers by their name. HOWEVER, next time might be advisable for all that people that work there to double check on the names...my fiancee did not like being called Mr. Smith (that would be my ex-husband)! They advertise on the big screen outside the hotel that your room gets serviced twice a day...didn't occur in our room. Not sure if the hotel is worth the price...
Nice hotel. However they nickel and dime you for everything. Room rate does not include resort and WiFi fee of $35 per night. If you try to use WiFi  is the most poor connection. You would ever have. They actually up sell you to a faster speed costing another $25 per night. Don't even try to remove any of the items in the mini fridge as you will be charge after 60 seconds. If you add stuff to the mini fridge it would cost you $25 additional bucks per night.. . Other than that, I think is a nice hotel. Be ready to wait 45 minutes to get a taxi.
I would NOT GO BACK TO ARIA AGAIN. . If you look at my previous review, I had a 5 star for Aria. This change is because of the service they provided during my stay this time around. . There were 3 major incidents that made me HATE ARIA. . . I had PRIVATE sign on in my room because I wanted to sleep in. Around 12PM, someone knocks on my door and asks me if I need towels which is bizarre. Why would you ever knock on a room that has a private sign on it in first place and I didn't even ask for towels. Now, if the incident stopped here, I wouldn't mind too much, but this person opens the door using his key which shocked me so much. I was just resting in my bed, but what if I was taking a shower, or doing something else in the room that required privacy? Or perhaps even just changing my clothes? As soon as I heard the door open I quickly told the person that I do not need towels and told him to leave. . . I left the room the second day with a housekeeping sign on, since I didn't receive housekeeping in the morning. I came back to the room after lunch and looking around some places, but there was no housekeeping done. I was fine with this, because we were outside only for about 2-3 hours. So I simply gave housekeeping a call, and let them know that we will be leaving the room again in about 5 minutes. I told the person that I would be coming back pretty soon and asked for the room to be cleaned meantime. I actually went out that time so that the room could be cleaned, I didn't really want to go out. Anyhow, I came back 2 hours later to find my room in the exact same condition as how it was before I left. I called housekeeping again and told them what happened and they said they will send someone immediately. It was such an inconvenience because I had to leave the room at 2AM so that they can clean it. I was hovering on Aria lobby for over an hour waiting for the room to be cleaned. Terrible experience. . . After this, I was pretty frustrated and I called the front desk about what happened, especially regarding the person coming into my room. The front desk apologized and told me that they will make sure this never happens again. . . Lastly, on the third night, again I had the private sign on. Someone again knocks on my door. I was thinking, well this time they won't come in since I called the front desk yesterday. NO. THIS PERSON OPENS MY DOOR AND COMES IN AGAIN. I TOLD HIM TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. I called the front desk pretty furious this time. They apologized of course and took the resort fee off and everything. . . STILL I think this is pretty unacceptable. HONESTLY THIS WAS THE WORST AND MOST SHOCKING HOTEL EXPERIENCE I HAD.
What is there not to love about Aria.... It's a Vegas get away must stay!!! We stay in Aria 3 to 4 times a year! Everything you want is in this casino or close by.... They accommodate our every request and have excellent service. Special shot out to Viviane at the players desk... She went out of her way to get all our reservations to a show and dinner!
Picture this: you open the door and the lights magically go on, the curtains open, and the tv turns on to welcome you. This is one of the amazing things we experienced staying at the ARIA. They even have a button you can press to turn EVERYTHING off, great for those nights you stumble "home". They have quite the extensive spa that you can purchase a day pass for which comes with a salt room, stone beds, therapuetic outside pool and in the locker rooms saunas and hot tubs. So relaxing! The casino offers many opportunities to gamble and win... and subsequently lose. The restaurants do not disappoint. The location is in the middle of everything and has easy access to the tram and monorail. We love the ARIA!
Stayed here one weekend with my girlfriends and loved this hotel! Rooms are very spacious and clean. We had a great view of the city even though it was not facing the strip. Only downside to the room is there wasn't an outlet near the big mirror so some of us girls couldn't use our straightener/curling iron. Also, didn't really like the idea how the bathtub is not separate from the shower. It was a weird layout where you had to step through the shower to get into the tub. But I guess it didn't really matter since we used the tub to fill up our drinks only! . . Location of the hotel on the strip was perfect. Towards the middle so it was close to the nearby clubs we went to. It is also surrounded by a shopping center with a few high end stores so that was a plus. . . Would recommend anyone whose visiting Vegas to stay here since both location and price is great!
Bummer! We had expected four stars or higher, based on other review systems we had read. The rooms, service, and all things considered do not compare to other "upscale" hotels on the strip. We had a nice room on the 22nd floor with great city view. Yes it is expensive ... but others are as expensive or more so, and worth it. This hotel is NOT worth it, to be frank.. . Pros:  1) good location/convenient mid-strip; 2) relatively new and not quite as smokey/stinky as some of the older hotels/casinos; 3) gorgeous facade with a water-fall wall, absolutely stunning and unique.. . Cons: 1) poor lighting in the room; had only a few small lights and lamps; was darkish even during the day with all lamps on; 2) our shower had not been cleaned when we checked in (gross hair-balls stuck along the shower wall); 3) bathroom lighting is also poor; make-up/magnification mirror is useless for additional light; 4) I agree with reviewers below about nickel-and-diming for wi-fi, etc; 5) neither bathroom sink drained, which was gross - both needed serious maintenance; 6) one main light "strobed" all 4 days of our stay blinking furiously, and no one bothered to change it (how could the cleaning staff even stand it?!). . We won't return there, unfortunately. Of the 4 hotels we have stayed in at Las Vegas, this one was our least favorite. Go with Wynn or Bellagio for better everything ... and similar price.
No problems at check-in.  The suite was nice on the 31st floor.  The bedroom  was well equipped with 3 sinks in the bathroom  hot tub, a shower for 2 or 4. The bathroom was sealed off wirh a glass door. It had a living room.with a bathroom by the entrance of the door. . .  The only complaint was the sinks drained to slow which turned out to overflow.  We had to call housekeeping to straighten out.  The plummet stated they made these sinks more for beauty than use. . . They transferred us to another room which wasn't as nice but they accommodated us in other ways.
Just a beautiful hotel and not a bad location. The rooms and bars and gambling area are all so beautifully done. There honestly isn't a bad area in the place including the mall and condos connected too it. . . They lose a star because their drinks are way overpriced compared to other locations. About $10-$11 for a cocktail, $7.50 for a draft beer. . . Other than that, service is pretty good.
I like the room in general. The king bed was big and soft. Really comfortable.. . We happened to get a city view, so it was great. Really busy street at night, beautiful to look at the strip.. . The room incorporated with a lot of new technology like the switch button for the curtain, and some sensor for your food bar and fridge. It says it the stuff is removed for more than 60 seconds or is replaced, you will be charged! . . Vegas, the hotel is just for sleeping.. . There was only the lounge open for entertaining at night, the club was under renovation. So I felt not a lot of fun in the night if you don't gamble. The lounge was $30 for gentlemen and $20 for ladies once it passes midnight. But ladies have unlimited drink all night. Not a whole lot of people in the lounge, but you still have no where to seat unless you have bottle service. Dance floor didn't get crowded, I guess just not a lot of people know it. . . Though the entertaining part seems a little limited, overall the hotel is nice and very convenient.
My husband and I love staying here for our mini vacation that we take every month ever since we've been together.  We've been staying here since they opened in 2009. I love the convenient of walking distance to most places on the strip. This hotel is smoking free and there's no Casino inside of the hotel and that's a plus for us. We come here for the entertainment, food and of course...shopping! Love this hotel.
Man, some people are just hating on Aria in these reviews. I actually enjoyed my stay here. It is a little expensive, but the rooms are nice and clean (which they all should be). I liked the feel of the casino. Very open and spacious.. . I like to play poker sometimes, so Aria having a poker room is nice. (Cosmo doesn't have one). Another huge plus is Aria is a part of M Life, so you get to rack up those player's card points!. . Even though this may not be my first choice, I'd definitely still stay here again. $100 on black!
Guest at Aria for 3 days with 6 couple and had breakfast at Aria cafe twice.. First time we got served by Regina, and she is amazing, very talented, detailed to direction and exceptional customer service.. And today, we had Noe, a total disaster, no clue, zero customer service, don't want to listen and speaking over you while you are trying to explain. . Noe less than 1star employee and Regina 5 + star.
We stayed at Aria for two nights this past weekend. The building is very very big and difficult to get around. It felt a little too secluded from the rest of the strip, even though in theory it's right next to many other places, it takes forever to walk out of the resort to the actual strip. . . I also felt very nickel and dimed during our stay, but maybe this is just Vegas. You cannot use the fridge in your room. If you do put anything inside of it you will be charged $25/day. There are sensors inside the fridge so if you touch anything inside of it, you will be charged. You also cannot touch any of the snacks on the table because they too have sensors and are insanely overpriced ($30 for chocolate). They do have a note next to the fridge and snacks that indicate this, so thankfully we didn't get swindled. . . There was no coffee pot in the room, so you had to buy extremely overpriced coffee from their restaurants. Honestly, when you pay this much for a room you expect to at least have coffee available in the room and access to the fridge. . . We ordered room service one night and the food was not the best and really over priced. . . The mattress in our room was very soft, so we didn't sleep very well. But if you enjoy softer mattresses you'll be fine. . . The staff, however, are incredibly nice and helpful! The theatre is also great, we saw Zarkana and it was spectacular.
Its a happening place with a great scene. No deals on the rooms as city center is where its at. Watch out for stores with French names as wife may desire said items. Very pretty hotel inside and cool restaurants. All is over priced
Returned to ARIA in November 2014!  Still luv it and won't stay anywhere else.  Started calling it my "Vegas Home!"  Happy they had the pool open (it's heated) and 3 hot tub options.  Do think they should try some type of flag system to alert servers at poolside.
Fell short of my expectations.  I was choosing between several of the newer hotels on the strip and chose Aria based on its reviews.  I liked some aspects, but just expected more and for the service to be more seamless.. . When my boyfriend and I checked in, we were given a low level floor that looked directly into other rooms.  We asked if they had anything else and they said they could move us to another floor with two queens instead of a king.  We went for it and as soon as we stepped into the new room I had to hold my breath because it reeked so badly of smoke.  I should have never made the first simple request.  The front desk rep on the phone told me to call back later and also that there were no smoking rooms in the hotel, yet they had just switched to non-smoking the day before (and we were asking if we wanted a smoking room when we checked in).  A few hours later we called back and after being on hold for 45 min and eventually going back and forth between the front desk and calling from our our room we finally got our room changed.  Management did give us a food/drink credit, but I would much rather have not had two hours of hassle when I was looking forward to relaxing.. . Then the TV in the room was broken and we had to call service again and needed a new cable box.. . Housekeeping did not come by to clean the room the first day.  The second day I had the service sign illuminated for over 4 hours in the afternoon while we were out and it still wasn't made up by 4 pm.  I had to eventually call to schedule housekeeping.  Once they came they did do a good job.. . I've stayed at Encore by Wynn and the rooms and technology are nicer.  I will say the beds at Aria are comfortable and the dinner reservation help was good.  I will probably go back to the Wynn or got to the Cosmopolitan next time.
Stayed here during the Rock N Roll Marathon weekend. . . My wife and I showed up around 9am, due to an extra early morning flight. We went to the front desk expecting to have to check our bags with the bell hops but to our surprise we were checked in and got our room keys right away.. . One of my favorite things about the hotel is the way the elevators are set up. I believe we were on the 26th floor and we had 4 elevators that only served 5 or 6 floors total so we never had to wait for an elevator and we did have to stop at five floors before we got to our floor.. . The hotel tower is well designed and seemed surprisingly small. We were all the way at the end of the hallway but it was not a far walk to the elevator.. . We had a king room which was pretty spacious. There was a sitting area and work desk and a huge entry. The bathroom was also spacious with an enclosed toilet and an oversized shower and tub. The bed was a little too soft for my liking but was comfortable. . . I loved the automatic shades and how everything could be controlled bedside. The blackout feature is pretty amazing and it does just that, blacks out the whole room. Perfect for sleeping in to recover from the night before.
Stayed at Aria one night during for my birthday weekend. Claimed comp room with myvegas pts. winning!. . +I was in Vegas during memorial day weekend. On Monday, I claimed myvegas pts and got a comp room at Aria. :) Unfortunately I couldn't bribe the front desk girl (Jolene) to upgrade my room by slipping money along with my credit card (The room is free but I have to pay for the resort fee). However, she noticed that it was my birthday weekend so she sent me a birthday freebie to my room and I received Aria's rice krispie dessert gift box set. Yay thanks Jolene!. +Jolene was also nice enough to offer late 1PM check out for free of charge. I can't thank her enough for her kindness, thanks Jolene if you ever read this post!. +Aria itself is such a nice, pretty hotel. I loved that my room was so high tech and beautifully. The remote control is available to use for the TV, lights, and blinds. The TV has an AUX connector to play your music, which is perfect if you're pre-gaming in your room before a night out.. +I usually don't care for hotel amenities but I really liked the ones at Aria! The amenities included one-time use make-up remover that was made with citrus & green tea, which smelled good! . +Aria also has deep, spacious bath tub. Perfect opportunity to use lush bath bomb and have a nice bath to pamper yourself. :). +Aria also shows Zarkana, which is one of cirque du soleil acts. If you're tired of the clubbing scene, I suggest going to Zarkana for change of scenery and a date night with your significant other.. . -The only down side about Aria during my stay was that the sink and the toilet was pretty dirty. I'm assuming the house keeping forgot to clean the bathroom, which is pretty gross. The toilet bowl had stains and the sink had cigarette ash or some sort of dirt on it. Eep.. -Aria's casino didn't offer low minimum for black jack so I was sad I couldn't gamble here too much. My friends and I gambled elsewhere.. . I would most definitely stay at Aria again but I hope they keep the room tidy and clean before checking people in. :/
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #25:. theentrance/exterior is space age and sleek; fountains, walls of waterfalls, interesting angles, and lots of lights; new and modern inside - just  like you would want the main hotel/casino of City Center; there's even a legit relaxing lobby bar; the restaurants all look fab - Sage, Javier's, Julian Serrano Tapas - all make you want to come in & eat there; even the coffee/dessert spot Jean Phillipe patisserie is cool & interesting; adjacent to the fabulous high-end shopping at Crystals mall; the sports book is really nice & tucked away, conveniently next to the Five50 Pizza Bar; there's a 2nd floor with a few more shops & restaurants, plus the Zarkana theater; best craft beer bet = clearly, it's at Five50 Pizza, but even slightly better is Todd English Pub just next door in Crystals (though the prices are high!)
My wife and I stayed at the Aria - 2 nights for a friends birthday party weekend.  This was our first time staying at this hotel.  Needless to say we had a blast and our customer experience was met and exceeded.. . Pros - Access to the hotel from the self parking lot was easy breezy.  I have always felt that in other hotels that the walk from hotel to the self parking lots is so far and too long.  The hotel - casino floor is very clean the air was fresh, I barely smelled any cigarette smoke.  The room was super awesome, we were on the 28th floor facing the pool and I can clearly see the Rio.  The best part of our customer experience is the beds felt like they hugged me when lying down.. . Cons - 2 Cons - 1.) Once we reached our floor the walk from the elevator to our room seemed very long.  Good luck if you got a room further down the hall.  2.) Initially the bathroom specifically the location of the toilet smelled like smoke.  Im sensitive to smoke smell but in this instance the smell did not bother me.  . . Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Aria and we will for sure book again.  I would have provided 5 stars but had to take 1 star away for the long walk to our room and smoke smell in the bathroom.
5 star hotel???  Really???..Sat at the poker machine at the bar and ordered a drink.  The bartender says said you have to pay for your drink $30 unless you play 5-$5 hands continuously and a minimum of $20.  Policy!  I receive free drinks in the casino but not at bar unless you follow their rules?  Nonsense!
Aria is definitely a class act and a nice break from the typical Vegas hotel scene.. . The hotel is new, super modern, with great ambience.  The rooms are not huge, but have great amenities including full A/V system and automatic curtains!  My only complaint with the rooms is the lack of counter space in the bathroom. . . Aria's location is excellent, next to Crystal shopping and the Cosmopolitan restaurant scene.  It also has several top-knotch restaurants of its own such as Masa and Julian Serrano.  The casino is expansive and uses the M Life program, though a bit on the smoky side. There are good lounges within the casino area, but the main nightclub is currently closed for renovation.  . . Check out the 2nd floor for a great, not too crowded Starbucks and good clothing shopping.. . I would definitely stay here again!
I wanted to give Aria 5 stars but a couple of things happened throughout my stay that reduced its rating in my book. . . First the Pro - . . 1. A high end hotel with high tech rooms. All the lighting, curtains, TVs, music, can be controlled through a tablet device next to the bed. . . 2. Stellar customer service all the way from bell desk, to house keeping, to concierge, and to the valet. . . 3. The hotel is not nearly as crowded as Bellagio and Caesar's palace. On Christmas day, those two hotels were like an over crowded farmers market, while Aria maintained a steady, and nice number of players and guests on the casino floor. . . 4. The gym was very nice. . . 5. Got a $75 meal credit to each room we booked. This deal effectively paid for the resort fee charged. I thought that was a nice touch. . . . Now the Con - . . 1. The drinks served at the poker tables were extremely watered down. I might was well paid for a real drink as I was sure that I was drinking sugar water. . . 2. The concierge girl gave me tons of wrong information including business hours of the nearby outlet, and location of the nearest Burberry store, which resulted in me walking an extra 15 minutes just to get to the correct location. . . 3. Made a dinner reservation at Lemongrass through the hotel reservation line. The restaurant later said they never got the reservation. . . 4. Luggage service had a 45 minutes wait time at check out because they were receiving all calls at one time. I understand it was busy... but I think the hotel could have anticipated this and hire extra shifts for holiday seasons. The lady I spoke to at the bell desk was not patient (an exception to rest of the great service I received throughout my stay).  . . . I want to increase my rating but for now Aria stays at 3 stars. However, Aria will probably be the hotel of choice upon my next Vegas visit.
Loved our stay here!  This is definitely not the cheapest hotel on the strip, but it wasn't the most expensive either.  I would say from what I saw, it was one of the best.  This was my first time in Vegas and our hotel was one of my favorite parts.  When we walked into the room, music turned on, window shades opened, very nice touch.  It was a big very clean and modern room.  Everything could be controlled via the tv or bedside controller.  I loved the bathroom with a large tub and large shower, but connected together.  . . There is a good selection of restaurant and bars in the hotel, we spent a good amount of time here and was never disappointed.  However, its not cheap, so you definitely are paying for the nicer restaurants and bars.  The service overall was great from a quick check in, an easily granted late check out and convenient bellman to check our bags at before going to the hotel.  When I go to vegas again, I will most likely stay here again.
Another stay at the awesome Aria and I was even more impressed than the first time. Their customer service is top notch and every single one of my needs and wants were met. You can tell their staff has a lot of customer service training and they deliver to their guests. Amazing!
Good hotel. Nothing out of the ordinary but with a great location. Smart and newer rooms.. No nightlife options except for a couple of sleepy lounges. Good options for dining inside the facility. Will be back mainly because of the location.
Not a cheap hotel...about $200 a night plus another $70 or so in fees that they throw at you at check-in.. . the room was nice but a little plain. Very modern with everything controlled with buttons, no more switches. . . I melted like butter in the bed, it was that comfy, but I suffocated under the sheets, those were surprisingly heavy. TV guide was slow, and kinda odd.. . they have staff check guests for room keys at the elevators which got annoying fast.. . staff was friendly but got some misinformation. . . the tub and shower were large and refreshing. but I didn't care for the glass doors. the glass door for the toilet was fogged but still bugged me. . . The room had a fridge but its stocked with overpriced merchandise that were weight censored = don't touch unless you want to buy. no room to put anything and it you do they will charge you $25 for using the refrigerator.. . That was my biggest pet peeve- almost $300 for the night and I cant even use the refrigerator!   . . the room was meh to me.
Based on the casino area alone, it's awful. I was expecting something spectacular. It's drab and the dark rock theme is actually dangerous if you're drunk. I dare say the casino floor was smokier than the old casinos on Fremont St. In this day and age, a brand new casino should be well ventilated.
First time staying here.. This resort is the best I have stayed at in Vegas (for this price range).. The service was surprisingly fantastic, when walking down the halls to our room any hotel staff pulls over out of the way to wait for you to pass and ask how your stay is. This must be policy here since everyone does it from house keeping to maintenance.. The one and only down side is our room seemed to be about a half mile from the elevators.. All in I will be staying here when in Vegas!
