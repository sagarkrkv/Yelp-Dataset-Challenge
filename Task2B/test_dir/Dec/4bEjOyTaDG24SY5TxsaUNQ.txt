My wife, daughter and son-in-law recently made a road trip to Las Vegas from their home in Palo Alto. Our lunch here was perhaps my best meal there, and it was also surprisingly affordable, at least by the standards of theVegas strip. The location is also great.. . I had the steak frites classique, which was superb, and well worth the 20-some dollars I paid for it. The steak was perfectly prepared (I ordered it medium rare), and was accompanied by a large mound of interesting and tasty french fries, fresh cut into ribbon shapes. (See my daughter Adrienne M's review for photos.) I am informed that the fries taste very good cold the next day, like good potato chips. My wife had the lobster roll, which was her second choice (she had asked for the trout almondine, but was told after she ordered it that the trout had not made it to the restaurant yet that day). She was, however, very satisfied with her lobster roll, and was particularly pleased that it was served on a Maine-style bun. My SIL enjoyed his steak sandwich. My daughter wasn't wild about her chicken/brie/apple sandwich; she thought it had a sour taste. The bite she gave me did have a bit of a sour taste to it (probably from the apples), but I didn't mind it at all, although being a true carnivore I preferred my steak. . . The meal was preceded by a fabulous crusty baguette, served with butter. This didn't last long with the four of us, but a request for a second was cheerfully and promptly satisfied (no extra charge).. . Service was also very good, prompt and courteous at all times.. . Highly recommended for an excellent and reasonably priced meal in a town where these two descriptions often contradict one another.
This was my third time eating here. As usual food was great, service let us down this time and it was not even as crowded as last two times.  I would still recommend eating here.
I had one of the best French dinners here!. It was outstanding and we were really quite surprised at how wonderful the food was.. . Escargot was buttery but not too greasy and had a parsley mixture which added to its unique flavor.. . The bone in ribeye is a must u have to order it medium rare and it will melt in your mouth with the perfect combination of herbs for the rich beefy flavor.. . The goat cheese in tomato sauce appetizer was magnificently seasoned as it burst in your mouth and filled your tastebuds with a tantalizing taste of balanced goat cheese and fresh tomatoes.. I'm returning!
Came here for brunch with my friends and loved it. This restaurant is located on the strip and has outdoor seating! Everything is a bit pricier but it's worth it! Location and food and service is great! Loved dining here
This place is perfect for a laid back lunch or a dressed up date night. Whatever mood your in. The decor is laid back and formal so it makes for a good 1st date spot. The service is great, waiters are friendly and very professional. . . The food here is fresh and flavorful. . . And their bread comes with a tart pickled relish and butter (it is so amazing). I ate through the whole loaf of French bread before my food came out. So, I was definitely too full for dessert.
I have been to Mon Ami Gabi on a number of occasions over the years, but hadn't been in about a year or so.. . I came here for lunch recently and the food and service were not what I remember. The plates and cups on the table were dusty and a little grimey. The food was not as tasty as previous visits. I have never been totally in love with the food, but it was always decent and the location and price point made it that much better. . . The lobster roll was overly creamy and mayonnaise-y and the croque Monsieur was ok and probably the best dish of the meal. Our dining companion found a hair in their salad and it took a long time to get our server's attention to get that fixed. After that her replacement dish was slow to arrive. . . It was a busy Sunday, so I understand that they were slower than usual but that didn't explain the dusty plates and glasses. . . It's still a decent restaurant to visit to enoy the patio and view of the fountains, the food just isn't as good as it used to be.
Made reservations through Open Table and arrived promptly at 6:30pm.  Actually offered a table out in the patio, but it looked way too crowded and cold.  Got a table by the window inside where we could see the street, and during our meal, portions of the fountain show across the way at the Bellagio.  Well, right off the bat, you are in Paris - at least based on the table size!  Our table for 2 would be a typical table for just a small flower arrangement in the US, but here, we cuddled up and attempted to read our menus in the dark.  After some frustration, and following the lead of other diners, we pulled out our phones and turned on the flash-light to read the offerings.  We felt sorry for the party of five that was 'snuggled' up on a round table that would seat 2 comfortably..... . Started with the French onion soup.  Meh. Very watery and not much in the taste or onion department.  A bit stingy on the cheese and bread, too!  Dinner salads were really good - especially the house mustard vinaigrette.  We ordered and shared the duck confit with pork belly and boeuf bourguignon.  The white beans and sauce in the confit were quite tasty; the bourguignon sauce was thick and rich (perfect for dipping the complimentary bread in).  All in all, a satisfying dinner - very pedestrian and somewhat Americanized recipes (compared to what we've had in the Provence and other more 'hoity-toity' French restaurants.  It's the Paris casino, it's Las Vegas, baby!
I went here with a group of 12 (Bachelor's party) and we were not disappointed! I made reservations on the phone. We arrived and were seated immediately. The french bread was warm, soft on the inside, and crispy on the outside. We had to ask for more.. . Pretty ladies greeting us in the front and gentlemen serving us at the table. The service was excellent. Majority of us got steaks which were cooked to perfection. Their frites that came with the steak were something new to us-- crunchy and not salty! Overall, this place was enjoyable and I got compliments for choosing Mon Ami Gabi.
Where to begin!  Now our dining experience here was not a common one - we were treated to dinner here.  We ate almost everything on the menu - although their French Onion Soup wasn't spectacular, their baked goat cheese, fresh French bread and steaks were to die for.  They had a great wine selection, and our server, Angie, was phenomenal.  She had great wine recommendations and was overall a joy to have.  Would definitely eat here again!  Thank you George at the Paris for everything!
What an great dining experience I had here. I got to sit on the patio and watch the Bellagio fountains which is really what made the whole experience. Our waiter was French which also added to the experience. He was very kind - but he forgot part of our order and he forgot that we had even ordered it when we asked him about it. We had the escargot and the steak and frites. The frites were done perfectly, and the steak was cooked just as I ordered. It's difficult to get such a thin slice of steak to be cooked medium, but they did it. I had their house Pinot Noir, but I was not impressed with it. The escargot was the perfect amount of softness and chewiness and it was drowned in herbed butter just as it should have been. The loaf of bread that comes complimentary definitely helped me enjoy the butter even more. . . One thing I found odd was that they served a cole slaw with their complimentary bread. I have not seen that done in French restaurants before. It had a very nice flavor - very fresh. It seemed out of place, but we did eat it all.
The view at Mon Ami Gabi is hard to beat.  We ate there for breakfast on a Sunday and just barely made it before the 11am cutoff for breakfast.  I got the Eggs Flourentine which were delicious.. . We had to wait about 15 minutes to sit outside on the patio even though I had made a reservation and requested outside seating.  But other than that, the service was very good.  . . Best part was definitely the view when you're sitting outside.  I would go back.
Best place on the strip to people watch sitting on a outside table on a sunny afternoon . I had chicken sandwich and capucinno . The sandwich came with French style fries. It was very tasty , though I would have preferred a healthier wheat bread in place of the ciabatta bread.
Ordered at the table of 6:. Warm Brie cheese plate (BEST EVER), Escargot on the way. . Shrimp cocktail. Carmelized scallops. (Kristie and I share both). . Merlot steak (Beth&Nic). Lobster rolls (TRAV Ben). . Salads. Fruit salads to share . . Chocolate mousse and bananas foster doe dessert. Yummo!. . Omg. Great choice.
I absolutely love this place for breakfast!  The patio is warm, the food is good and the people are friendly.
Mon Ami Gabi is by far one of the best culinary experiences I have had. All the reviews on here raving about the food are accurate. You will not be disappointed. I would have given this 5 stars but I was turned off by the fact that you cannot reserve the patio. IMO you should be be able to reserve at least part of it and then leave the rest as first come first serve. The service is not that great and I am not a diva by any means. We ordered the Mussels and the plate came out with the sauce under the bowl so it dripped all over the table and our waitress did nothing about it. The server saw it and he finally covered it with a cloth. Between appetizers and our main course our waitress did not clear the table and I started to place our dishes on the table next to us to make room. When she saw this she rushed over and said, "No this table is clean." I wish mine was too! lol. Aside from that great place don't expect the same quality service as the food though.
Had another great meal and oustanding view from this restaurant on a recent trip to Vegas.  We had a large party of 7 and sat oustide on the patio on a nice spring evening.  You simply can't beat the location and view of this restaurant, right across from the Bellagio fountains.  The food is pretty good, not cheap, but not too expensive either.  Definitely not your typical snooty upscale Vegas dining.  The portions are reasonably sized and priced ($20-$30), with steak, seafood, and even a few pasta options.  I had the steak frite, medium rare.  It was cooked perfectly, relatively tender (it's not a filet, but wasn't bad), and seasoned well.  The dinner and selections worked out really well for both the grandparents and kids.  Very versatile.. Positives: Excellent location and view of the Bellagio fountains.  Recommend eating on the patio (no reservations accepted, supposedly).. Negatives: The wait for patio can be long....we were told about 15-30 minutes, ended up taking 45-60 minutes to get a table.  But it was worth it!. This is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas, you can save some money for the casinos, get a reasonable
Second day in LV, we started with a nice brunch at Mon Ami Gabi @ Paris Hotel. The patio was fully packed, but we wanted to seat inside anyway. Very nice, warm, cozy decor inside, it does remind us of Paris restaurant.. . Nice grand entrance! Inside was pretty full too. Nice warm, cozy French decor.. . Really enjoyed their complimentary French Baguette - served warm, crusty outside and soft inside, perfect!. . French Toast - thick piece of french toast served with blueberries and warm blueberry syrup and whipped cream. I really like the blueberry syrup, real blueberry taste!. . Egg Benedict - with Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce. I've had better Benedict, so this one is nothing to wow.. . Seafood Crepe - very very fresh seafood, especially the scallop! Not a bad choice.
We've been here a few times and are never disappointed. This time, we went for breakfast. The service is usually pretty good, but this time, it was exceptional, and our server was very nice and energetic (understatement).. . The food was very good. I had the corned beef hash and poached eggs. Depending on how much you eat though, the portions may be somewhat small. In addition to our main dishes, my wife and i shared an apple cinnamon waffle, or was it carmelized apple waffle, i dont remember. What i do remember is the apples tasted great and the waffle itself was so good. . . For our other meals here, we've always had lunch or dinner, and always opt for the steak frites. Food was very good and at a reasonable price, especially for vegas. Add that you even get an amazing view.
Amazing gluten free eggs benedict! And amazing service! :) always a favorite when in town!
Local aconchegante e otimo atendimento. Comida excelente.
excellent setting & great food
Had the Moscou Mule and the Wild Boar Ragu. The mule was delicious as well as refreshing. The Wild Boar Ragu had beautiful pasta as well as tender pieces of boar, bacon and cheese. The pasta noodles were cooked to perfection and the boar was juicy and flavorful. Recommend highly.
On my last trip to Vegas I made it a point to try Mon Ami Gabi. I heard really stellar reviews on this place and I love me some French food!. I dined for brunch enjoyed the escargot and the baked brie. Their Nicoise salad was a generous portion. I also inhaled the baguette they served at the beginning of the meal. The prices here are pretty steep (with drinks about $65pp) and that was just for brunch. It is totally worth it though and I left a happy camper. Next time I am in Vegas I will definitely try to go back again.
I've been here before and loved it, but this last time (last month actually) was just ok. I remember they used to have a juicy burger on their menu, which is gone. Fries are yummy. But I just was not impressed. I think it's great if you can get a table outside to face the Bellagio fountains, but inside it's kind of loud and not my favorite. Definitely better dinner spots in Vegas. I do love their name though.
Please do not come here for breakfast. The meal tasted as it was brought for the buffet. Eggs had tons of butter and the hash browns were old. Very disappointed in the meals and had to pay $18 for it. Never coming back.
Great gluten free options....and other breakfast food also.  Fresh orange juice and great French coffee...
There are just too many better restaurant options in Vegas other than Mon Ami Gabi .... . Mon Ami Gabi is a fairly popular French restaurant located in the Paris Hotel. The biggest reason to dine here will be its outdoor patio seating. These patio seats come with a great Bellagio fountains view and they are 1st come, 1st serve.. . A pretty casual dining atmosphere and service was good. . . Steak Frites (Bearnaise, $27.95 - meium rare): Good steak quality, average tasting mashed potato, and flavor for bearnaise sauce was weak. (3.5/5). . Chicken Paillard (roast kabocha squash-sauteed mushrooms, lemon butter, $20.95): I liked the chicken, but nothing really struck me as special. (3/5). . This is a good example of somewhat mediocre restaurants in Vegas.
Simply amazing!! It worth it! Beautiful place, great services and the salmon eggs benedits where to die for. Definitely recommend it ;-)
Everything great, from the coffee, orange juice and the eggs simply amazing.. . Very beautiful and Cousy. You feel like in Paris.
We arrived at the bar at 1:00 Robert the bartender was over the top fantastic I mean who would of known such great service and entertaining way he has about himself,treat yourself to a good lunch and the greatest service for lunch on the strip don't waste your money any where else !!!!
I've eaten here twice in the past year: both times for breakfast, but with very different people.. . On the first trip, I was with glam gals Bianca B and Trish S. They are way fancier than I am, and they both liked Mon Ami Gabi. The second trip was with my boo and my parents. My dad is more of a good ole boy, and he can be a bit hard to please. But he loved his steak and eggs so much that he wanted to go again the very next morning!. . Moral of the story: Mon Ami Gabi is a crowd pleaser, no matter the crowd you're trying to feed. . . I have to give a special nod to MAG for their awareness of gluten-free options. I was dismayed at the lack of gluten understanding in LV, but this place gets it right. I've had the gluten-free eggs benedict both stops here, and it was absolutely delicious!. . If you're on the Strip and find yourself hungry for breakfast, Mon Ami Gabi is a great pick for any palate!
Second time here. First time around, my girls and I got salmon benedicts- which were excellent, except for when one of them found an eggshell in her food. The english muffin was a little more toasted than usual but i didn't mind that very much. When she pointed it out, we were met with a shrug. This time around I took a friend to whom i had raved to about the benedicts here.  i ordered the salmon benedict once again. This time both eggs were overdone. Seriously, Mr. Cook/chef at Mon Ami Gabi? Poached eggs have to be slightly runny. These were almost boiled. There was too little hollandaise. Moreover, the english muffins were rock hard, to the point that i could not cut a piece with my silverware. The best and only edible thing on the plate was the hash browns. That is disgraceful. . . I will never be going back.
It was our second time and we are happily impressed. Our server Matt started us off with a baguette accompanied with french butter and a shredded mix of apples, celery, capers and lemon juice. Delicious! We started with the escargots ($14.95); extremely tender. My husband order a side salad ($8.95) with mixed greens, picked jicama, heirloom tomatoes tossed in a lemon Dijon vinaigrette.  It was a decent size salad. For our entrees we ordered the Wild Boar Ragu ($21.95), and the 22 oz. Bone in Ribeye ($39.95) with frittes. Since I didn't know which sauce I wanted to accompany my steak Matt (server) offer to bring three. We even were able to an extra baguette.  All in all it was an amazing meal for a descent price. If you're in for French on a dime this is the place.
Came here for a Bachelorette dinner with Bride to be and it was such a great experience for us. We could of been seated outdoor and had a even better view of the Bellagio watershow but it was too cold- given the fact that it's December. However, we were still seated smack down in the middle of the restaurant where we were able to enjoy the water show indoor- warm and toasty.. . Our server was great! He had a great sense of humor, and also made sure our baguettes were never empty. The baguettes were always piping hot and fresh. I guess it does feel like I am in Paris. HAHA.. . Food was EXCELLENT. They're really popular for their Steak Frites. . . I ordered the "Bordelaise" Steak Frites- with caramelized onion & red wine sauce. The Steak was medium rare- the way I enjoyed it and it was a really. The meat was cooked to perfection, literally, Medium rare. I loved the frites, so good. Not too crunchy like regular french fries but not too soggy as well. . . The "Garlic Spinach" side was also delicious. I love garlic, so anything with garlic is hands down!. . The "Onion Soup Au Gratin" was amazing. It was really cheesy and the soup was not too salty either. Loved it.. . I had a wonderful time with my girls at Mon Ami Gabi. Will definitely return again for probably brunch and definitely dinner. . . Although I felt like Mon Ami Gabi was not how I would expect a French restaurant would be like, I am still super satisfied. MMM!
My friend has been wanting to come here for a while, so we made it for brunch this last Saturday. It was my first visit to the Paris hotel and casino, but it wasn't hard to find the restaurant since it's large and has a patio right on the strip. Our reservation for 5 was accommodated despite being late for our reservations. The waiter was a little quiet and hard to understand at times, and didn't really check up on us. . . Since we were having brunch, I decided on getting a Bloody Mary that you fix yourself at the bar. I've never made my own at a restaurant before, so the idea of it was fun but mine didn't turn out as good as I expected. I wish they had more garnishes instead of just celery, olives and peppers. . . For food, we started with the escargots which were pretty good. I also had the classic quiche and I thought it tasted fine, but not something I would care to return for. My boyfriend's steak frites was the best dish I sampled. I liked the crispy fries a lot. The temperature of the steak was a bit overdone though.
I had the french onion soup, the half plate of mussels and a steak.  (shared with my fiance). . the french onion soup (though a bit pricey but it's a big portion) and the mussels knocked it out of the park.  the soup wasn't too salty and the cheese absolutely melted in your mouth.  but the mussels were the true star of the show.  Big, fat, juicy, and perfectly cooked.  not a single dud.  You can't go wrong with it.  . . The steak was good, frites were good. nothing exceptional though.  . . If I'm ever back in vegas i'll go back here for the mussels every time.
My husband and I have dined at Mon Ami Gabi several times over the past few years. I originally discovered it on a list of the top ten restaurants on The Strip, and we don't go a visit without eating at least one meal there (some trips we've eaten at Mon Ami Gabi twice). Their service is top notch and the food is really incredible. Everything we've ordered has been delicious, from breakfast and brunch items to dinner. It's definitely a good idea to make a reservation so you don't have to wait, although their patio seating is first come, first serve. During our most recent visit, my husband and I shared the frisee, kale, and warm bacon salad with a soft-poached egg, he ordered the cinnamon pancake, which was a large crepe with a side of blueberries (brunch was over but they accommodated him anyhow), and I had the seafood crepe. Their crepe batters are perfect, never chewy, and so delicately thin. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!
Hostess process sucked. They were very rude this morning. How many times do I have to give my name?  How much longer do I have to wait for my reservation?
For starters I had the cheese scallops and they were pretty epic.  Also had the eggs benedict and it was good as well.  Only issue was that my muffin for the benedict was kind of overdone and a little tough.  Other than that the flavors were spot on.  They also bring warm fresh French bread to your table with rich creamy butter.  The bread was really good.
Went for breakfast recently and had a great time! The services was very friendly and attentive. I had the french toast and fresh berries and it was perfect! Slightly sweetened but crunchy. It was wonderful and I will be returning for brunch again soon!
It was a great lunch at Mon Ami Gabi.. . My girlfriend had the classic quiche lorraine, which was delicious.. . I had the croque monsieur, i felt like home.. . Go for it!
I've been wanting to try this place for a while and I think it'ssafe to say that this is one of the better breakfast/brunch places on the strip. My friend and I split a quiche and their pomegranate and pineapple pancake--both of which were extremely filling and delicious. The quiche was light and fluffy, and the onions, bacon, and herbs complimented each other well. The pancake turned out to be more like a crepe and was not overly sweet.  My favorite part of the meal was the pineapples which were sauteed in what tasted like brown butter.  The service was excellent and we didn't have to wait long for a table.. I'd come here again for brunch.
One word: BRUNCH. The eggs Benedict is simple and delicious. Hit up the Bloody Mary bar and create your own. Request to sit outside & watch the Bellagio water show across the Strip. Mon Ami Gabi gets just about everything right. Service is quick & polite. Note they won't seat you until the entire party is present. That goes for large parties all the way down to two people.
This upscale restaurant is located in the Paris hotel and their elevated outdoor patio gives you a prime view of the Bellagio fountain show.  It was too cold outside for our liking though and we were seated in their sun room area.. . Sunday Brunch offers a Bloody Mary bar which my girlfriend and I dared to try.  While fun, we both now appreciate a good bartender more than before.. . The steak and "frites" I ordered medium came out medium well but I devoured it still.  It being a French restaurant,  I decided to try their escargot...and although it was fine, there is plenty more I'd rather eat instead.  . . Expect todrop $100 for two if you care to have more than just water.
Regardless if you have a reservation or not they make you wait because as the front desk slave stated "Its first come first serve".  Absolutely no reason for such terrible service. I've been coming here for years and this will be my last visit. The last few times I've been here it's been on the decline... Don't risk it, just take your business elsewhere!
Best meal ever .and service was great!
One of our touchstones in Vegas. Consistent, well priced fare. Good place to chill and relax while watching the Fountains at Bellagio in the background. Not fussy but not a diner. Bistro vibe in a restaurant setting.
We came here for breakfast, but arrived not long after they'd switched over to lunch menus.  Our waitress had no problem bringing us a breakfast menu, and that just made my day! . . Ordered their smoked salmon benedict that comes with (what the menu calls) "potatoes" ... but please know that they mean "hashbrowns."  Not a bad thing, but "potatoes" to me says something else entirely; I guess I just visualize large chunks not shavings, besides, most places will state "hashbrowns" if that's what they serve.  Okay, done with the dang potatoes!  . . We also ordered the baked scallops gratinees, a side of date-glazed, thick-cut bacon as well as cappuccinos (which were very small in quantity, but good).  Just don't expect to get your caffeine fix with one.  . . Service was great, everything we ordered tasted absolutely delicious, and the only slight issue that arose was quickly & thoroughly rectified far beyond our expectations!!  . . Definitely stop here while you're in vegas!  I know I'm going back whenever I'm in Vegas again :)
I found a great new spot in Vegas right on the strip.  The ambiance transports you to Paris and the food and wine were great as well as the service.
I ordered the eggs florentine, and I thought it was okay. I thought the hollandaise sauce tasted off and the entire dish was too sour. The side potatoes were pretty good though. My girlfriend thought her seafood crepe was average, but the scallops were overcooked. . . Some old lady at a different table decided she wanted to feed the birds and started throwing her bread toward me so the birds started flocking toward me. I asked her to throw the bread in a different direction. If you are going to feed birds at a restaurant (which you shouldn't), at least throw the bread crumbs around your own table. . . There are a couple of these around Chicago, so we probably could have skipped this place.
I've been coming here for breakfast every time I am in Vegas. The food is delicious but the coffee is magical. It's smooth and rich, and as is the case in a few, rare places doesn't require sugar.. . The selection of Benedicts is fantastic, the croissant sandwich is to die for and the egg white omelets taste amazing.. . The staff is attentive and friendly, the service is excellent and the decor is authentic and quite lovely.
Really fun restaurant on the dirty as hell Las Vegas strip. It has a great French vibe with the decor to match. When you sit down they bring you baguette with good french butter.. . I ordered the Steak Frites of course and I went with the cognac sauce. Really well done. I loved the fact the frites were the kind like in France you eat with your fork with each bite of steak. The steak was cut thin and me and my wife split it with a side salad with the frisee, lardons and a poached runny egg. That salad was the bomb!. . All in a really good meal, I can't wait to go back.
Love!!!! Best breakfast. Had their corned beef hash. Real corned beef. Also had the nummy bananas foster waffles. Holy goodness!!
I don't understand the French fascination with adding french fries to steak, but they were good fries, and it was exceptional steak. I highly recommend the New York Strip with the Roquefort sauce. Mouth-watering. The bread pudding, roasted chicken, and spinach side were similarly excellent.. . So good is Mon Ami Gabi that I would put it way, way, way ahead of Gordon Ramsay steak. I love Gordon Ramsay, but our experience there was overpriced and not at all up to the standards I've seen Ramsay scream at people for not having when they're in front of a television camera. If you want steak, Mon Ami Gabi is no slouch and you're going to have just as satisfying of a meal for a bit less money.. . Only complaint: my steak was supposed to be cooked medium, and I found it to be a little over, as did most of the meat-eaters at the table. Still, the outstanding flavors made up for it and I stopped thinking about it largely after the first bite.
A perfect setting to enjoy Bellagio fountain show and people watching. I ordered a filet mignon merlot, cooked perfectly and tender. But I feel that it needed a bit more seasonings. My husband's beef bourguignon was also okay. I was excited to taste the app escargot, but somehow the herb butter sauce tasted weird or "off". They forgot my escargot order, so I don't know if they cooked it in a hurry or what. Anyway, the chef was very nice to give us a complimentary prifiterole (to make up the forgotten escargot order) which was delish.
I have been here for dinner with my husband. We order the 2 wine, one appetizer, one steak, and one scallop.  real like scallop, must try! But the steak, it's not my favorite. We also order the one pudding, and warm chocolate cake. Price around $130. I feel the price is a little bit high, but the view is gorgeous, you can saw the bellagio water fountain.
My parents took my sister and I here for dinner before heading to the show across the street. We sat inside instead of out on the patio because it was a pretty chilly night. I had the skate wing. It was cooked so it was a little golden brown, almost as baked. I'm not sure how it was prepared but I enjoyed the subtle crunch when I bit down. The chewy texture on the interior was interesting. Not bad but not spectacular. Next time I'll come with a date, order steak frites, and sit out on the patio to enjoy the fountain show.
Came here after reading several great reviews on yelp. This is my my first time in Vegas and the first meal I had here and man oh man it was AMAZING!!! Sat outside and watched the fountain show at the Bellagio. Me and my bf had the chicken liver pate and the onion soup, 22oz steak with fries, half chicken and mashed potatoes and a large french sangria to drink... AMAZING! Must try! It's worth the wait at the door! And all the servers were super nice
Tess was super rude delays us for no reason and we missed the breakfast menu . . Lunch sucks supwr over priced . . You are getting chilli's food at french laundry pricess. . The chef c should change his staff,  or climb to the top of the tower and let his self respect decide on the next step. . I'm here wishing i could swim across the pond to my hotel
This is my favorite spot in the strip, too bad they keep messing up on food 3 several time in a row. But they made up for it by giving us another champagne or free breakfast. Must try this place, the scenery is very good, make sure you get a table in atrium area.
Had a fantastic Christmas Eve dinner, had a huge group and they took care of 16 of us. Great menu food was good.
We dined here for the second time on Christmas Eve. Somehow it managed to be more amazing than the first time. We started with the warm goat cheese appetizer, which was out of this world. I honestly could have eaten it with a spoon like soup. Two of us enjoyed the French onion soup, which didn't disappoinr. For our main courses 2 of us ordered the scallops with Brussel sproutss. I have have never eaten Brussel sprouts tasted as divine as these. Holy cow! They honestly outshine the scallops. The scallops were great, it was just that the sprouts were that awesome. The other 2 dined on steak and beef. Both enjoyed their meals as well. I cannot wait to dine here again!
Love the service by the staff here, the woman attending to us on xmas eve night ytd (irene? I forgot, but i knew she had short hair) was considerate and professional. The food we had was good too, the seafood platter, the chicken dishes and the trout. Ate our fill!
This place sucks. We ordered a seafood platter for $49 (2 half lobster, 4 tiny oysters, salmon salad, 3 shrimps) and a caramelized sea scallop $25. The scallops were the worst ever! There were 4 scallops, pretty big, but they were definitely over grilled that all I could taste is bitterness! Won't recommend this place.
3.5 -- closer to 4 vs. 3 stars. . When in Vegas, I recommend this place for brunch. . Open table, once again is also recommended for making reservations to avoid long waits.. . Ask for patio seating, it's well lit and it's nice to people watch whether inside or outside the patio.. . Everything is pretty good here. The french toast is sweet on its own and does not require syrup in my opinion. The corn beef hash was really good and paired so well with the runny egg yolk! Love their escargot and mussels, the steak + fries. can't go wrong with and their complimentary bread is addicting. If you like french onion soup, you definitely need to order it here! If you have no other place in mind, this is definitely a safe, go-to spot that will not disappoint! :)
Sadly I don't have a great review I have been to this restaurant several times even had my wedding reception here I have been for Christmas dinner the last 5 years I have recommended it to my customers I no longer feel confident doing so. Our Christmas dinner just was not a good experience this year. First we waited at the bar patiently for a drink. The bartender came across as cocky his rather dry sense of humor was not appropriate. We were seated and told as soon as the rest of our party arrived to basically hurry up and order. The seafood tower was not good the waiter forgot my husbands soup brought our food it was cold when he took it back he acted as if he was doing us a favor because now my husband would have time to eat his soup the worst was we got our food the 2nd time it was still cold and the rest of our party was finished eating. They did take quite a large amount off our bill but my Christmas dinner ended up to be left over pizza after I got home. Disappointing
Wow what great service and atmosphere the French onion soup is AMAZING sat outside and got to see the fountain show they have many heaters so inn the winter it makes it very comfortable we had Doug as our server amazing best waiter we have had in Vegas by far.
Very awesome restaurant in all respects: good food, good service, good environment, etc. I had French just like three times before. Base on my limited experience, I always thought French comes with very small portion. I ordered the steak and my friend ordered seafood crepe and fish. They are all in huge portion, especially the steak! And they are delicious!!! The hand cut fries and French bread are great! . . If it's not too cold, try to seat outside. It's really romantic and you get to see the strip. . . I would give it a 4.5 star.
One of the best restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at. Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas! Notwithstanding Gordon Ramsay Steak, and perhaps The Bacchanal at Caesars Palace but that's a buffet and in a different league altogether. (I'll save that for another review) Not to mention these are really very reasonable prices on the Strip.. . We came for breakfast, rather early at 7am, since we were up at 5am due to the most horrendous jet-lag having traveled all the way from Minneapolis. Coffee and provisions were desperately needed. We got seated on the patio by request, with a view overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio. I was on my summer vacation and ready to enjoy myself thoroughly. My Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict was spot on. Rich hollandaise sauce covered the English muffins and it was truly a remarkable experience. I am a huge fan of the coffee. (Intelligentsia coffee, I believe) It was rich, strong and flavorful. It revived us perfectly. We also shared their Blueberry Pineapple Crepes, special of the day. Came with a little boat of freshly whipped cream. They were light, sweet and scrumptious. Good for sharing. . . For an impromptu, spur of the moment breakfast idea, this place was a 10 out of 10. Service was exemplary, waters were promptly refilled, and the restrooms are located out of the restaurant and inside the Paris casino. The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and very French, in keeping with the theme of the hotel. They have nightly dinner specials. I think I saw Beef Wellington on the Sunday menu. In case you wanted to give that a try instead of Gordon's Beef Welly across the slotmachines. His food is pretty spectacular too though, so have a go at it. Every time we go to Vegas, we'll make Mon Ami Gabi a regular breakfast spot.
Just ok nothing spectacular. I think it's way overrated. Had the oatmeal which was undercooked and super thick. Had the egg breakfast and potatoes were cold. Would expect more from a 4 star.
Some might think that it was crazy to sit on the patio with the temperature being 36oF but it was crazy good. The fruit bouquet had fruit that was ripe, so I not disappointed, which can happen with fruit. The crepe "the skinny pancake" with apricot, the special for today was just the right amount of sweet. I normally don't like a crispy bacon, but I enjoyed the thick cut of bacon. The musicians close by playing guitar very well and the fountains across the street just made the meal. The servers were attentive too. Underneath the heater we had a great breakfast experience. I will be back.
Excellent service  . Accepts reservations. Outdoor seating with heaters (in winter). Megan was our waitress & she was excellent!. Typical Vegas pricing . Nice high ceilings, natural light, comfortable seating.. Nutella waffle - Devine!
Started out with goat cheese with some garlic bread.  Then shared a few plates :. . The steak and frites . The lobster roll . The scallops . . . Long story short the steak and lobster were amazing the scallops were bit cold and slimy but they are scallops and that's how it comes. Service was good a bit pricey but it's Vegas get with the program.
French bistro.  Fun atmosphere, but make sure you sit on patio.  Waiter was one of the best.  Steaks were excellent.  Recommend goat cheese tomato salad.  Only negatives was rude hostess and The creme brulee was cold on inside.
WOW! . . the bf and i had made reservations here before we were off to watch jersey boys, and everything from start to finish was fabulous. We were seated right away with delicious, fresh, warm, bread to snack on before our meal. coming in I knew i wanted steak, so i ordered the "classique" since it's always better to be safe the first time, right? the steak is large but thin at the same time. the BUTTER on top omg, i don't think i've ever had steak like that before. it was goddamn mouthwatering. hats off to the chef for cooking it a perfect medium rare too. and the fries, wow. I am NOT a french fries person, but i ended up inhaling these thin, oddly cut fries. . . the restaurant is gorgeous on top of the great service. I had requested to be seated on the patio, but because it's so cold these days it was covered up. No worries, the view of the bellagio foundation always looks good. . . i will DEFINITELY be back next time i'm in town.
I've wanted to eat here for the longest time! Finally had a chance to come here for breakfast last week when we were in Vegas. There was absolutely no wait at 10:30am on Christmas Eve (yay!) and we were seated outside on the patio. The weather was actually very nice and the heating lamps kept us warm :) For food, we ordered the eggs Florentine and the caramelized apple pancake.. . Eggs Florentine: Eggs Benedict with spinach and artichoke. This was very good although nothing too extraordinary.. . Caramelized apple pancake: I had no idea that by "big skinny pancake" they meant a delicious big crepe-like pancake! I've never tried anything like this and it was REALLY good. Nice and fluffy with several crepe layers and lots of whipped cream on the side! Highly recommend trying this.. . Overall, good food (at least for breakfast) for a decent price! And the best part about sitting on the patio is the beautiful view and the people watching that you can do. Service was also fast and friendly.
family staying at the paris so we went for brunch on Christmas day.  I had the CB hash.  I'm a hash man and the server slightly oversold MAG's hash.  it was more like big chunks of corned beef and big chunks of potatoes neatly placed on a pretty plate.  I will say the crust on the corned beef and the quality of the meat were top notch.  the eggs were also cooked perfectly. the potato chunks lacked flavor and weren't cooked with the same love as the meat.  I also tried the lemon pancake.  it was darn good.  overall a good experience but not good enough to bring me down to the strip on my own freewill.
Brunch with the family was out of this world.  Waffles, pancakes, kale salad, onion soup, bacon, everything is delicious.  Waffles are crisp while has a nice body to it. Nor wonder saw a long line as we were departing.
I come here a lot. And by a lot I mean once ever 2-3 months. I've always a great experience until this time. I ordered my usual  steak classique well done with puree. My steak came and it was medium rare. I kindly asked my server if they could take it back and fix it and they did. But this time my steak was just rare. My mother ordered the chicken pate and she wasn't please with it so she order the same thing as me and her steak was rare as well. One of the worst experiences I've had at this establishment. I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.
The solarium is one of my favorite brunch spots in Las Vegas, but the setting trumps the food quality.. . Ambiance: The solarium is an enchanting venue.. . Crowd: Foreign tourists on a Christmas morning. . Menu: Americanized French breakfast fare. . Service: Attentive and accommodating. . Food Ordered: Chicken, brie, and apple crepe; smoked salmon with toast; fresh orange juice.. . Food Quality:   The crepe was good, but it lacked complexity of flavor.  Frankly, it would be better without the chicken.  The smoked salmon was also nice, but the quality was slightly below what I would have anticipated.. . Value: You are certainly paying for the view.. . Notes: Make sure you can eat in the solarium.  The rest of the restaurant is dark and uninviting.
My girlfriend and I were very excited to try Mon Ami Gabi for dinner as part of a mini-staycation.  We had a comped night at Bally's, and I've been meaning to try Mon Ami Gabi since moving here 2.5 years ago.  Unfortunately, we didn't have the great experience that I've heard many other people rave about.. . First, the positives...our seat out on the patio overlooking the Strip had an awesome view of the Bellagio fountains.  Even as locals, we enjoyed this view.  Our server was fantastic, very engaging, and had great knowledge of the menu.  He also recommended the Baked Goat Cheese appetizer, which was absolutely delicious.. . We both ordered Steak Frites, which unfortunately did not live up to expectations.  My girlfriend ordered the Hanger Steak, and we both agreed that it was tough.  Not just a little tough, but really just not edible.  Our server and the manager did the right thing and replaced it with a filet mignon at no additional charge, which was delicous.  I got the signature steak - the sirloin.  The sirloin was thinner on the edges and thicker in the middle.  The edges were delicious, but the middle was chewy and tough.  I'm not sure if the steak was poorly butchered, or should have been cooked differently, but either way, it was not well-prepared.  By that time, we had already sent one steak back, and I had eaten some of mine before realizing the problem, so I did not send mine back.. . Not sure if we caught the restaurant on an off day - maybe a cook called in sick, or they got an order of lower quality meat, but we did not get to have the Mon Ami Gabi experience.  We were disappointedthat Mon Ami Gabi did not live up to it's reputation.  We're torn between trying it again because many locals we know love it, or checking out one of the many other steakhouses on the Strip.
