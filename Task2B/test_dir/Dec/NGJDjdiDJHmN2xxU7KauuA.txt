I wanted to stay in one of Vegas' iconic hotel so what better than the Flamingo. We'll I was sorely disappointed. I don't know what I thought I was going into, maybe 50 fabulous or a throwback to the mob run Vegas. Nope....it was a little dirty, doesn't look like it had been updated since the 80s. . The positives is that it's cheap, super cheap. I think we paid no more than $250 for 4 nights. It's right in the middle of the strip, there were no problems walking everywhere. They have a late night pizza place that will make your made to order pizza in about 20min or you can just grab a slice. . Would I stay here again.....hummmmmm......it's debatable. For the price and location yes for the atmosphere no.
Got comped for 2 nights and decided to book the Go Deluxe room at the Flamingo after reading the Yelp reviews.. . What's the deal with the parking structure?! Worst design ever! And half of the spots are reserved for valet and the Hilton. Really?! This is Vegas. Knock it down and build a better one! . . Oh, and of course the valet was full at 10:30pm. So pissed and so frustrated after circling around the lot for a parking spot. I just drove for 3+ hours, and all I wanted to do is check-in and sleep.. . The check-in line was ridiculously long, but it was Christmas week so it was understandable.. . As we got in the elevator, someone else was getting out around the 12th floor... It looked pretty scary when those elevator doors opened... The lighting was dim, the carpet was dark... Eeek!! But luckily we were on the 25th floor. And when the elevator doors opened, I see a bright hallway and elegantly tiled floors. Whew!!. . The room was not bad at all. Very clean and modern. Bright room with a big flat screen TV, with a little 2.1 sound system. The windows has a electric switch for the drapes. The bathroom has a frosted glass sliding door. There's a TV embedded in the bathroom mirror, with a Bose ceiling speaker. Modern sink - like a bowl on the counter. Separate shower and tub. The king sized bed is soft, with lots of soft pillows. Comfy.. . Okay... Here's my rant... The resort fees. $20 per day. And for what?! Phone? In today's day and age, who uses a telephone? Internet? They only allow access to 1 device per day. For 1 person maybe it'll work... But serioulsy... how often would one go to Vegas and stay by themself? If you're going to charge me $20/day, at the very least you let me use WIFI on all my devices.. . Overall... meh. Only paid $40 for a 2 night stay on Christmas. I suppose I can't complain too much.
No stars. Absolutely the worst stay I have ever had.  Turned down the covers to go to bed only to find the sheets were covered in human hair. Not just a couple,  but hundreds.  It's like the hairiest man slept in them the night before and they forgot to change them. They just made the bed.  I took pictures to prove it.  . . I called customer services who said they would send someone to change them. After an hour wait, the maid finally showed up.  We watched as she tried out three other sets of sheets but pulled them off when she saw they were also dirty.  Finally she found some that appeared to be clean and finished making the bed.  . . After she left we checked the sheets and the did appear to be clean,  although I have my doubts they were. . . Customer service gave us a food credit of $30 for our troubles, but when I checked out I found out the credit was not good for the places we ate. At the time we ate we were told the meal was charged to the room, so we thought we were good to go. What a big suprize to find out we weren't.  So we weren't able to use the credit, and it actually cost us more. . . The room was booked through my company for a convention, otherwise my wife and I  would have left and found a room elsewhere.  I can promise that I will never stay at the flamingo again.  It's a filthy dirty run down mess.  Nothing in the rooms say luxury.  If you don't believe me,  just look at the pictures. If you do decide to stay here,  you've got to check the sheets!
This is a review of the Flamingo Valet!!! . . They are terrible... It took almost 30 minutes to get my car as I didn't have an option to park in their lot! I'm diamond and it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes! Then I ask to follow up on my car and they don't even have the nerve to admit that my car fell through the cracks! But they tell my wife what a bunch of morons!!!. . Again this is a review for the valet only!!!
Stay Here everytime I make a trip to Vegas! Love the restaurants on the property and not to mention the great rooms! Never had a complaint... If you're complaining about the rooms looking low end maybe thats because you're in Vegas and you need to spend a bit more and maybe upgrade a few floors because the new upgraded rooms are amazing!!
If I would've known I was gonna stay in a peasant hotel when I went to Vegas, I would've gone to Reno instead.. . This place sucks. . . First, they charged us some crazy deposit for God knows what. Luckily, they put the money back in my friends account like 5 days later, so that was an early Christmas present for her.. . Our room was so janky.  I bet you $100 you couldn't find ONE THING in our room that didn't have a stain on it. That would be the only bet I would've won in Vegas. Was someone murdered in that room!? Our toilet paper holder was a PEN. Seriously, our TP was being held up by a freaking PEN! . . I can't even begin to talk about the lighting in this room. Our selfies made us look so basic. And one thing we are not, is basic. And there was a SERIOUS lack of outlets in there. So I had to charge my phone like a mile away from my bed.. . They have a food court, but I'm pretty sure I can find better food at a soup kitchen.. . I won't be staying here again because I am a princess. But peasants, feel free! This place is your Nirvana.
It took me two weeks to write this review because I was literally seething with hate fire for so long after staying here. . . First of all, this hotel has two sides: The Donnie and Marie Pink and White Fun Time side and the Peasants covered in basic b*tch side. Guess which side the happy customers are on? Not our side, I'll tell you that. . . It was like everywhere else was covered in shiny pretty lit-up glitter and fascinating lights and then you walk into the dust covered, faded eyesore that is the Flamingo and you're like I have to stay here?!. The check-in line was relatively quick, albeit it was Thanksgiving and most people were not traveling. It was also really cool how nonchalantly the check-in girl told me that they did not have the room we reserved 3 months ago, and they had no more non-smoking rooms left, but she would upgrade us to a bigger room with "great view.", oh and the list of fees on my reservation failed to include the insane deposit fees which cost more than my room! Like how do they even do the training for that? I just picture some cheapo slimeball like, here's what you want to do, you want to subtly tell them something that can ruin their vacation, but present the info to them with the tone of voice that says 'hey, its no big deal.' . . @#!@#!$@#!@^&%^% And the wifi isn't even easy to use and can only accommodate one person. And the resort fees are for nothing. You are paying for wifi and a gym that doesn't even seem to be anywhere in the entire resort.. . The "great view" was of the lobby's roof and the pool that is shut down for the season. La di da. And this room was gross. And it was tiny. I had to clean my own toilet because their incompetent staff failed to do an adequate job. The toilet paper itself was held, not on a roll, but on a flamingo pen. WTF?!?!?! The bathroom isn't even big enough for two people to get ready, like helllooo Vegas? That is part of the fun and you're shitting on it. The shower curtain had super gross mold on it. EWWWW. . . The pillow and sheets didn't even look like they had been changed. There were stains on every surface in the room. Sheets, pillows, tub, toilet, walls. Grossss. . . Everything in the room was unplugged when we got in, we had to plug all our own lights in in the dark using the flash lights on our phones. There definitely weren't outlets in the room. I had to plug my phone in on the other side like a freaking common peasant and then get up every time I needed to check something. Basically impossible when you've been having fun all night in Vegas. . . And their room service menu was insulting. I must have reread it like 17 times in the hopes that something appetizing would appear. It was a joke. . . And their food court -OH MY GOD - if I never see another Johnny Rockets burger again it will be too soon. They only had Johnny Rockets, some not Panda Express type place, a pizza place that doesn't even serve Pizza all the time and the strips most okayest wrap place, I think that place had about a million things on its menu, but I don't have time to read a novel when I'm hungover so I just stuck with the basics. The food was all awful. It was like two parts grease for all parts anything else. Eating it was a chore and I will tell you the greasy BS theyre passing off as food won every time because I could not finish any of it. Nothing tasted even remotely fresh and to be honest, I've had better tasting experiences at McDonalds.. . I hated this hotel. Thinking about it makes me bitter. I'll do whatever it takes to never stay here again. I can't.
Staying there was not horrible however we won't stay there again. It's just old and needs to be renovated. Most of the staff was nice. The restaurants are average, nothing special. It's was relatively clean. Beware of the carpeting in the hallways, it's so old and stretched out that the wrinkles are about 2" high and could be a hazard for the elderly and disabled.
We get what we pay for... and then some! Considering the low price, I find the customer service here top-notch. Every employee we encountered was helpful and courteous. . . We're very familiar with the strip, and knew upon arrival that the Flamingo isn't the newest hotel around. The pools here are beautiful, and you can't beat the location on the strip. They upgraded our room to a strip view that beat any of the views at the suites we've had at Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay or Treasure Island.. . We had a Go Deluxe room, and the upgrades are a little odd. The refrigerator sits on the floor and it's strange that you can see beneath the sink. However- the upgraded shower is a blast! . . All-in-all, it's just a room, but the hotel is such an icon on the strip; we really enjoyed staying here. . . If you're looking for a luxury experience, go for a newer hotel, or something more expensive. If you're looking to add an extra Las Vegas trip into the year, and don't spend a ton of time in your room, enjoy your stay here!
I give the Flamingo Las Vegas zero stars!. . I stayed here earlier in the year, and had a gift certificate for a FREE room for two nights in December. When I called to book my FREE room for December 14 and 15, I was told the price for the FREE room was $56. When I questioned paying $56 for a FREE room, I was told the room was in fact FREE, but the fees involved totaled $56.. . Personally, I consider the "resort" fee of $25 per night charged by the Flamingo to be a junk fee and I won't pay it. . . Caution: Make sure and look carefully at the small print when booking a reservation at the Flamingo. Like a FREE lunch, a FREE room is not FREE at the Flamingo.. . John Howard. Oxnard, CA
Stayed over the weekend in a go room it was great! Had a great experiance with check in. Checked in online requested a early check in and the room was ready 2 hours earlier then planned! Room was clean and stocked the only complaint was the club next door was a bit loud and you can hear it. Everyone complains about resort fees but they're pretty standard and upfront about it
I went to Vegas this past weekend (Dec 12th through 15th) and stayed at the Flamingo. I walked through the lobbys of a few other hotels and though the flamingo isn't as impressive as some of the others, for the price and location it's definitely worth staying. I stayed in room with a king bed for a total of just under $200 for the ENTIRE stay. I got the reservation through some sketchy seeming website I was directed to from one of the bigger travel websites. My view from my room wasn't great (probably because of the price) but honestly, I had a great time and "enjoyed" the room about as much as you can enjoy a hotel room. The next time I go to vegas, I'll definitely be staying at the Flamingo. If you're looking for a super luxiourous room, the flamingo, or at least the type of room I stayed in (I think it was called a deluxe king), might not be for you. BUT if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive hotel, in the middle of the strip, with a nice staff, and a comfy bed then this is definitely for you. Besides, most of your vegas stay should be spent outside the room anyway.
I usually stay in a Go or Go Deluxe room but was trying to save some money during Frozen Fury (October).  We decided to go with a normal Fab Deluxe room due to the savings it would lend us.  BIG MISTAKE.  We were in the Habitat Tower and were overlooking the Linq.  The noise from the Linq made it nearly impossible to sleep.  I called housekeeping to request ear plugs, but they don't carry them.... I could purchase them at their convenient store though.  The bathroom was also in desperate need of a remodel!  The beds and pillows were SO uncomfortable too! . . The elevator up was nice enough, but once you got to the hallway you could tell it had not been updated in at least 15-20 years.  The carpet was rippled and you could literally trip on the bunched areas.  Our ice maker didn't work and it was just one huge pain in the butt.. . This last stay was the worst ever in Vegas.  We ended up checking out at 4:00am just so we could get home to CA to get a good sleep.  I have never actually wanted to leave Vegas until this trip.
Getting worse by each year. Feels like Las Vegas it self getting worse and worse each year. Not so friendly staff at the registration, very confusing choises of the rooms, at the booking asks check in preferences, not telling you early check in fees, once you at the registration 20 usd more for getting your room early. We were at 2 pm. Have to be there 4 pm but check out  at 11 am. Rooms stinked like toilet. Had to switch 3 rooms. It took me 2 hours. Until we get settled which it was already 4 pm. Service is 0. But seems like each request gets you 20 usd more cost at the guest services.
We reserved the room online however the room "could not be guaranteed" by the hotel.  They could not even put us in a similar room but instead gave us a petstay room which smelled like pee we didn't even have pets!  We asked for another room but again they could not help us. We picked to stay at the flamingo because of the pictures online but inside the room is a dufferent story the wifi dose not work and the cable is snowy and also surprise.. the updated cd radio in the room also dose not work! The bathrooms were dirty and theres no working fan. Gross. We had a horrible experience with this hotel and its staff.  We will NEVER stay there again!!
I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed staying here. Flamingo the top choice for my parents (they get comped by Harrah's) and even though the hotel is old, it has a lot of things working in its favor.. . First, the rooms have been renovated. I'm not sure what our room was called, but judging from the pictures it wasn't a Go Room. We had a desk, king size bed, vinyl floors, and a chaise lounge that faced their flamingo habitat.. . Location is the next thing in their favor. You're pretty much in the middle of strip and it's a quick walk to the other big draw casinos like Bellagio and Planet Hollywood (hey, Britney!).. . The resort fee is borderline ridiculous. It basically doubled our bill and covered wifi and a daily pass to the fitness center. You could only connect one device at a time to the wifi, so it wasn't as convenient as it could have been. Plus, the TV sucks and it would have been nice to have the option to stream something.
This hotel needs to be renovated and maintained.  The hallway rugs need stretching and cleaning.  Our room was clean. The shower spout put more water in the tub then in the actual shower head. The sink was cracked. The floors are laminated and are actually quite boring an drab. Outside the property the area is strewn with garbage. Do yourself a favor and stay someplace else.
Decided to try this place despite the negative reviews.. . The friendly lady who checked us in upgraded us to a room on the 27th floor at no extra charge (forgot her name, it sounded middle eastern though). No, the hallway was not smelly. Yes, we could see the linq ride to the right of our window and no it was not noisy. Yes, the sink did take a long time to drain and the shower head needs to be replaced or adjusted. But other than that it was pleasant. The room was spacious and fairly clean. One star off for the sink that gave off a dirty fishtank smell and the broken iron that leaked water on your clothes. . . Don't expect to be amazed or impressed by this average hotel. You don't come to Vegas to stay in your room all day do you? After all, if you expect luxury maybe you should shell out thousands for an upper class hotel and stop complaining el oh el. . . Stayed here last weekend. Paid 140ish for 2 nights. Paid a 100 dollar deposit on check in and got it back in a few days.
Meh. I wouldn't say we got a deal on the two rooms I booked - two rooms for two nights cost over $325 total, and I had to cough up another $312 when I checked in for these two rooms ($100 per room deposit - even though I used a major credit card? And $28 per room per night resort fee). Granted, I got the $200 back when I checked out but still. This was the weekend after Christmas. The gentleman who checked us in was very nice and helpful. Like the other have said, check in at 4pm, the line is LONG. They used to have check In kiosks, not anymore. The rooms were basic. Like others said, paint chipping off the walls. In my brothers room a piece of the headboard had broken off before they got to the room and the appropriate solution was to just prop it against the wall. . Thought we would give it a try since we allegedly had gotten "Black Friday" deals on our rooms. Think we may stick with our tried and true next time.
For being in the middle of the strip and the price they want, how can someone NOT stay here? Not to mention the rooms are really nice! . . My husband and I booked our minimoon here over the weekend before Christmas. I love Vegas during Christmas time, its so pretty! . . The rooms are great, we stayed in a general 2 queen beds room and now a Go-deluxe room. The deluxe room is our favorite. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud the entire time. We kept the room about 65, it was perfect! The blinds are on a switch so that was pretty cool, we had a great view of the Bellagio fountains, and the room was huge!. . This has become one of our go-to spots in Vegas.
Worst hotel on the strip. Once I checked in, they told me that they were still cleaning the room and would call me after. It's been 3 hours of waiting. Do not recommend this hotel. I wouldrather stay at motel 6. Pathetic
I am very happy with my visit with Flamingo. With the rewards I got from my WIP (work in progress) gambling addiction, I was able to get 3 free nights during my Las Vegas stay. This is a great location located in the middle of the strip. You can walk to just about any casino INCLUDING planet hollywood to see Britney Spears. Yay! . . This hotel is a much nicer than what I would except. The room I stayed in was remodeled with faux wood. Pretty nice faux wood though! The view on the upper floors are great. . . 2 complaints though. The resort fee is a joke. Almost $100 for my my resort fees after 4 nights. My final complaint is that you can only log 1 device to their wifi. Pick wisely on which device you want to stream n=N etflix on.
Second time staying in the flamingo. First trip was with friends: had a good room which had a couch and everything. Super comfortable and had a great time. Would have ranked that experience 4.5/5. The customer service was great and the upgraded us and everything.. . . External: 1/5. - The exterior of the hotel is quite large making it very easy to find on the strip. It's not the tallest or the biggest building, but it's probably the oldest. All signs lead to flamingo. The outside is kinda weird looking with a really old Donny and Marie signage. Being in the middle of ceaser's, the linq and Cromwell: all of which are new or really luxurious make flamingo look like a dump.. . Internal:2/5. Casino floor not much better. The check-In area looks fine, but the garage looks HORRIBLE: and there's never enough parking. The casino floor has this horrible orange carpeting. The floors themselves aren't much better. The elevators are missing floor labels AND buttons! WHAT? The first habitat elevator on the left didn't have a button to get to the 17th floor, so we had to wait for another elevator.... . . Service: 3/5. - It was great when I needed it, but the fact that I had to need it was a problem. First, housekeeping didn't clean our room so we had to request it at 10pm when we got back. Of course that ment we have to find something to do during that time.. - The wifi is horrible and the fact that we have to pay a resort fee for it is also a huge scam. . -Uponcheck out I used $90 in comps to pay my room. I had like $20 bucks left and The guy just took the rest off, so the room was essentially entirely free. THANKS!. . Rooms: 2/5 (Double bed high roller view deluxe...). -the toilet had a water problem and kept draining. Super loud and the water smelled like sewer water. Ugh.. -Plasma screen TV, fully functioning and quiet heater. . -the room was FREEZING when the heater wasn't on and they turned it off during cleaning so we always came back to a freezing room.. -not enough outlets: we had to unplug some of their stuff so we could charge our things.. -horrible cellphone reception for ATT and Sprint. - the first time I stayed here the rooms looked much better with funky pink shag carpeting and accents on the beds. They were unique and very flamingo. This time we had bare essentials.. - Standard amenities. Nothing here blew my mind, but nothing was subpar either. . -NOT enough lighting! NO NO NO. Biggest complain is that it was REALLY dark. The curtains do a great job of blocking everything out through. Oversleeping is easy.. . Food: 3.5/5. - there's a small cafe by the elevator that serves the greasiest pizza known to man. The cheese falls right off the pizza: basically liquid.. - the food court is decent. Johnny Rockets is nice and has good service at a decent price. Didn't do buffet.. - Everything is 24/7: best part.. . Casino Floor: 2/5. -nothing was hitting and the wait staff was pretty rude.. - Margaritaville in fact did not have the $5 advertised craps or blackjack tables. And yes, we were there on weekdays.. - cages are pretty efficient. Though they feel the need to ID people to cash out if they look young... This is a first for me.. -best bet is to just play next door at Cromwell. Everything there is new and clean and professional with similar table minimums. . . Overall not a good trip by any means. Sorry flamingo, you've lost me.
Staying here for NYE. So far, except for the parking situation, the Flamingo has been a pleasant surprise. I have a Go room with a view of the High Roller. The room is excellent. Maybe the best non-suite I have ever had in LV. The room is spacious with a great bed, big closet, and nice bathroom. But yes, the sink drains slow. The casino is just okay. It is a little run down and the crowd includes some people you may not want to hang with. I guess that's the price you pay for a $10 craps table.
It took my wife and I one hour to check it. We walked into our first room to find the bed without sheets. We first thought, no problem lets call the front desk and get someone up here ASAP. After waiting 40 mins for someone to bring the sheets, we called the front desk and asked for another room. We got the other room BUT our keys didn't open the room. We finally got everything worked out but it took too long.
Love this casino, too much fun, great customer service. Cocktail waitress so funny and actually are not stuck as the other ones. Security really nice and not rude as others. Such a good vibe.
