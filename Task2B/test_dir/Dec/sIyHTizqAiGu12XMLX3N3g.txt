Awesome weekday breakfast buffet! . . We were pleasantly surprised by the weekday breakfast buffet.  It was delicious and I thought the price was reasonable.  The servers were so attentive.  The atmosphere and decor were very nice.  I would definitely go back again.
When my girlfriend told me that her family recommended that we go to a "buffet" I nearly died. I am a foodie...we don't do such things. I mean...it is against the foodie bible (if one existed). I cringed and figured that I was going to lose out on spending a chunk of money for a crappy lunch. They told us to check out this place. Whoa I was waaayyy off.. . Every station was incredibly well thought out. I loved the Singapore noodles, Clam Bake Buckets, and everything in the dessert station (especially the chocolate souffle, chocolate croissant, and the red velvet whoopie pie). . . We went during lunch. Totally worth the price. Hard to believe...but true. I guarantee there cannot be another buffet in the entire universe that has anything to beat this place. I will never go to another buffet in my life, except this place.
Haven't gone to a vegas buffet for over 10 years.... Boasted from other yelpers to be the "Best buffet in Vegas"... So me and my family decided to start with the best.... Bacchanal buffet got me caught up really fast! Sitting at the table and munching away for three hours felt like a little fat kid in a candy shop! It was such an amazing feeling!. . Ticketing: Just get line, press on screen, input cell number to be texted when seating is available, and wait for the rsvp print out. First time seeing a self check-in kiosk for a buffet! Technology is one scary mother!. . Wait time: We came early around 1030am on Friday for brunch and got in after 10 minutes of waiting.. . Tip: Come early to avoid long lines to get in. You can also elect one person to stand in line for you.. . Service: Buffet staffers were intentive, friendly, and totally awesome. Our empty plates were taken away every time we left to get more food. Our mimosa glasses were never empty! Kudos buffet staffers!. . Food: Sooo much meat, soooo much crab legs, sooooo much OYSTERS, soooo much desserts to chooooose from! Pinch me.... is this a dream come true? Have I gone to meat and seafood heaven?? I think I had octuplet food babies that gave birth to other foood babies... Ughhhhhh.... the struggles are real!. . $50+ Gets you in! Worth every single penny, nickel, dime, quarter, one dollar, 5 dollar, 10 dollar, 20 dollar, 50 dollar, and 100 dollar bill! Won't be disappointed!
I have to say that this buffet and the wicked spoon (cosmo) are the two best buffets I have had in Vegas.  First- the line here holy crap!  This is not joke, plan ahead to wait and wait and wait.  Luckily you can check in then head back to your room until you get a text saying its time to wait in line (which will take at least another hour).  Its on the expensive side, but there are definitely more pricey ones out there.  I went for Sunday brunch, and the selection was outstanding!  This buffet is HUGE, I have never seen one so large.  Some of the items are outstanding while others are pretty bad.  The ethnic selection is great, but some of the foods are so BLAND it almost doesn't matter.  But for the price you really cant beat it when you get some good quality items.  The fresh boiled crab legs (not the ones at the seafood station) are a hidden gem that it seemed like not many people knew about.  The ramen station was really delicious as well.  They had fresh oysters but the line to get that was too long, sorry after waiting forever I was not interested in fighting people over oysters.  The crab claws were pretty horrible, probably the most disappointing thing I ate, they were still frozen, and full of water.  So disappointing!  They did have bottomless champagne and a bunch of fun juices to choose from.  The dessert bar was huge, I couldn't eat any more so I cant comment on the quality of the desserts, but they certainly look good.  . . 5 stars for being the top buffet in vegas without higher prices!
I'd give this a 3.5 stars... Came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon. Took about 1 hour to get a text telling us our table was ready. It wasn't actually ready, we had to first pay, then wait in line for another 30 mins for a table to be ready. Once seated the server promptly took our drinks orders. We then went scavenging across the buffet. . . There is a huge assortment of food here. From Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Mexican, meat, seafood, to a basic salad. I tried out the crab legs as they seemed to be very popular. All the food I tried was excellent. My favorites were the mac n cheese, the lamb, and the cheese board. . . Dessert was a bit disappointing. The cookies and cakes didn't have great textures, but the ice cream variety was pretty impressive and delicious!. . Layout of the dining room is good. Never had to wait to get to the buffet. We ended up having 3 different servers, which was a bit weird, but they kept our drinks topped up the whole time.. . Overall I was quite impressed with the selection and quality of the food. I'll probably come back at some point, but I'll test out a few other restaurants on the strip first.
Whoever rated this place 4-5 stars must never had any decent buffet before!. This place is overhyped and overpriced for being the "BEST buffet" in vegas!. . I came here for dinner at 3pm. . Raw oyster - tasteless. King crab legs - ok. Crab claws - tasteless. Prime ribs - dry . BBQ ribs - too salty, too tough. Lamb chop - undercooked. Sushi - One small tray for a $50+ buffet are you kidding? And the fish is drying than a mf. Chinese - maybe good enough to fool non-chinese food lover...but none looked good.. . What I did like :. . clam risotto. ice cream. egg tart . . Funniest thing is they take a picture of you as you lined up with no interesting background and tried to sell you the printed picture for $20!?  Who the F in the marketing department thought of this deserved to get fired.  . . The TV ad for this buffet looks stupid as well, having a much of jazz dancers dancing to at the buffet..........that totally makes me want to come again!
Hands down the best buffet on the strip. Wicked Spoon is amazing, but Baccahanal blows even them out of the water. I can't imagine coming to Vegas again and not eating here.
We were not expecting to make it here because we have heard of the ridiculous wait. However, we came on a weekday for lunch and were seated right away. First impression was the place is huge. We were going to be seated at a corner somewhere but we asked for a closer table near the pools of the hotel. There are many options here. The Asian area has good dim sum and the best BBQ pork my husband has ever tried. The sushi was meh. The rice was too chewy but the fish was fresh. They have a nice area with different cheese and cold meats. The prosciutto and manchego cheese were my favorite. Next to this they also have baby mozzarella and cherry tomatoes with basil.  Look hard because you might miss them but you don't want to miss them. Their pasta area looked OK.  I only tried a seafood pasta dish served in a small dish pan and it was very tasty. As far as American food we tried the prime rib which was very well seasoned and melt in your mouth good, and the mac and cheese which had a Southern taste to it. The sliders were very good as well. I also had the paella and it was very scrumptious. They had a pork belly with lentils in a small bowl near the Mexican food area. It tasted like the Asian BBQ pork I mentioned before. The only Mexican dish I tried was the Chilaquiles. The sauce was bad. I can make better Chilaquiles from a can. True story. They have a juice section. The guava and hibiscus were my favorite. The dessert section, my favorite section, was generously stocked. If you don't like star anise don't try their 5-spice Chinese chocolate cake,  yuk! Everything else was divine. Their gelato a little on the watery sude but very tasty. The coconut flan was good and so was the creme brulee.. . Our tummies were happy here. We spent 2 hrs trying different foods and slowly enjoying them. Food is coming constantly so nothing tastes old.
If you visiting Vegas and you are hungry this is the perfect buffet for you! They have everything; I personally really liked the beef and the chicken. The selection of the meat is really great. Cooked and grilled very well. The dessert bar was awesome, I tried some fruit and cookies, in one word - WOW! The wait in line is really sucks but it's worth it. Go for it and you won't regret it, guaranteed :)
By far the best buffet in Vegas. Expect the wait to be at least an hour each time to get seated. Not cheap but good value for money. Prime rib is amazing, as are the crab legs. Plenty of choices. Seafood (mussels, crab, oysters), meat (prime rib, beef rib, pork rib, ham, turkey) Chinese, Japanese, cheese, salads, fruit and lots of desserts! Service is good too. I've been 3 times now and it's a must each time my husband and i go to Vegas
Bacchanal is a pretty good buffet. I was able to find a selection of different foods that I wanted to try, and most of them I enjoyed. . I am not a huge fan of buffets because sometimes they don't have anything I feel like eating, or the quality is not that great.. I've been to this buffet a few times, and I have not had a bad experience yet.. It is a bit more expensive than other buffets in different properties, but I did not feel like I overpaid. . I just wish the desserts were a little better.
MOST EXPENSIVE PHO I'VE EVER HAD. . I love this buffet. It seriously kicks all them other buffets ass out of the water. Why?. . 1. HOT crab legs! Others got them cold but here you can ask them to steam em up. . . 2. Huge variety of cuisine! Even the Asian food tastes good and not like Panda Express filler!  Mexican station is fancy and delicious too. . . 3. Delish dessert station! Everything is good here. I mean it. The gelato flavors are unique (habanero mango?!), the crepes are fresh, cookies and cupcakes baked perfectly and it goes on and on. Other places have one or two yummy items and rest is crap but not here!. . 4. Home made PHO!  Best hangover cure - c'mon when you're in Vegas you know there's going to be some drunkies who will appreciate this one!. . 5. No lines! You punch in your name and number and they will text you when you're table is ready! Genius! Go gamble or hit up the bar and waste more money haha. . I love it here. It's pricey but worth every penny. When paying your $50+ bill just think- that's like one hand at black jack or a few shots at the club!
I used to love this buffet. My daughter and son-in-law had their wedding reception there when it first opened a couple years ago. But it is not the same place any more. I ate there the night before Thanksgiving. The food was either too salty or too sweet. Most of it, except for the salad veggies, was inedible. And the horrible duf duf music was too much. We asked the manager to please turn it down but he refused. He just simply didn't care.. . What was particularly shocking was the oversalted Asian food. Asian food does not need to be oversalted. I tried three desserts and all were so sweet I simply couldn't eat them. . . If you want an elegant dining experience with excellent food and a staff who cares find another buffet.
When you live in Vegas you don't really do many Buffets, well at least I don't. However, I did come here to celebrate my daughter's birthday on a Friday night and I must say, this is by far the best buffet in town. Sure it's expensive but oh so worth it. You definitely get what you pay for and then some.This decor of this buffet even looks fancy.. . You get an assortment of good tastyfood including cold and steamed crab legs, oysters, chicken and waffles, dim summ a taco station, shrimp and much much more. They have a pretty good selection of pastries too. With this buffet you get the best of both worlds, quality and quantity. I will most definitely be coming back soon.
Buffets aren't usually my thing, and I initially balked at the $70 cost for two people, but it was WORTH IT. They aren't shooting for the lowest common denominator here, which means you can expect the chefs to take risks (and in our case, resulted in feelings of euphoria with every bite).. . Highlights included the perfectly juicy prime rib (cut upon order), beautifully acidic ceviche (a nice palate cleanser in between bites), everything in the Chinese section (especially the beef with Chinese broccoli; it's hard to find great authentic Chinese food, and I certainly didn't expect it here), and the molten lava cake (with luxuriously rich dark chocolate that was not sweet per se, but unmistakably indulgent).. . Oh, and Bacchanal's decor is clean and modern, but who cares, it's days later and I'm still in a reverie about the epic meal itself.
No lines! Glad we came early after the gift wrap up! This time I tried more Asian food and seafood... Also enjoyed the mimosas
I paid $175 for 2 adults and 5 year old during Thanksgiving, and it was just a mediocre mealfor us. The seafood quality sucks: crab legs are too salty and not fresh, Dungeness crab has soft and low quality meat, sushi so mediocre. Worst rack of lamb I have ever had. Prime rib is tough and only comes in rare. Pho and desserts were the only good selections in this highly rated buffet. Will never eat a buffet again after this.
Don't believe all the hype. Yes, it is good but no better than Wicked Spoon, M or Wynn.  Ate here on Saturday for "brunch".. . The good:  NO LINE. Got right in with no wait at 10am. . . Food was all good quality and tasted tasted good. Memorable were the charcuterie selection of meats and cheeses (some fresh baked baguette would be good there).  Truffled scallop potatoes. Pizza and Asian selections were good. Eggs Benedict had no flavor at all. . . The less than good:  sorry guys, the dessert selection sucks. Lack of selection and all gelato was so weird nobody wanted to try - "beer shandy gelato", nah. . . NO PRIME RIB. Really? For brunch?  LAME. LAME. LAME. For $50 LAME!!!!!. . They seated us right where the service staff stand and hawk over everyone. All we heard all meal were their Spanish conversations and them constantly glaring at us. Service was fast but uncomfortable.
Came around lunchtime and the wait wasn't too bad. $36/person. I was quite disappointed, though. When I try a new buffet, I like to scope out the selection, and what I saw wasn't very appetizing. Maybe it was the presentation, but I wasn't excited to eat here. I went to the meat department, and got a taste of everything, but that was pretty much all I had to eat. . . The lighting was dim, and the music was ridiculously loud. It felt like they were trying to be a club rather than a buffet. . . I'm pretty sure I won't be eating here again.
Overhyped and underwhelming. Food quality was sub par and it was expensive. A good place for $30 but not $55
Super good buffet! From the crispy and moist duck to smoked brisket (has the red ring), oyster shooters with cucumber water (very tasty), dim sum of Har gow and of course the crab legs that are sliced opened for you. Man, this place has everything for just about any type of eater. The quality is high and worth the price of this fantastic buffet. . Now I know why some friends come here every time they visit las vegas. . The only draw back was the okay server we had. Not that friendly but some others at the other tables were. Could have been an off day. . Oh and save the appetite because the desserts was fantastic! The dark chocolate lollipop has a cake with a ganache, many flavors of gelatos such as mango habanero, mint green tea, etc etc etc. And all tasty. . . I guess also the prime rib was okay compared to the smoked brisket. Hard when my prime rib at family dinners beats this easily. . Enjoy!
I actually really like it here. Rate it about 4.1 stars. One of two of my favorite buffets in Vegas in high class food and atmosphere but of course, pricy up the ying yang and that is why it's short of getting 5 stars to me but can't rate on Yelp that way.... . Love the variety of ethnic foods...my fave is the baby oysters with horseradish and cocktails sauce. I love the taste of their lamb chops! It's tender, juicy and not gamey..so good. They offer crab legs half cut to make it easier to take out. They have unshelled medium sz cocktail shrimp and ceviche shrimp, too. They have soups, sushi, salads, prime rib, pizza, sandwich stuff, etc. They have so many desserts like crepes; with. add banana and strawberries with nutela and of course, add ice cream is my fave. They have french macaroons and much much more. Been here how many times now but can never eat all as I always come out with food COMA. Burpppp........ . I recommend coming here on an empty stomach to try and concur all of the food varieties. There is a line to wait to get in here as well to consider. It's strange to me they would try to photograph you after you pay? Best time to go here is during the weekday dinner for $3.00 off from weekend pricing. ;-)
Buyer BEWARE: I decided to have dinner there on Sunday night and had the most horrible experience at a strip hotel yet. I noticed that my bill was quite a bit higher than I was expecting to be charged... $10 higher!! I asked the agent "Chona" why it was more expensive this time since the last time I was there wasn't that long ago. Thinking that they might have broadened there selections or something to warrant an almost 20% increase I was rudely told that I was mistaken and told this has always been the price. Really!! So I asked the manager "Ira Greene to please educate his staff as to what is true and false about the pricing and what warrants this rate hike. He rudely argued with me stating that I was correct in the increase of price but continued to say that I shouldn't expect to pay the same price at all times. He had no answer for what warranted the increase other than different time different price. Sad!!! I'm assuming that from the other reviews I've read lately that the other difference that I'm paying more for is a reduction in quality and freshness.. I'll never go back to this establishment... Actually I'll never go back to any Caesars entertainment run facility. Now I can better see why they are in the predicament they're in!
I almost gave it a 5 because it is an amazing buffet, but if I'm going to pay $50 for a buffet it ought to be pretty awesome. I liked a lot of the smaller dishes like lentils with pork bell yams the oriental chicken wings. But I didn't care do much for the bigger things like the Prime Rib and the crab legs were snow crab not king crab. I liked the buffet at the Bellagio better.
By far, the best buffet in Vegas. I mean, I get overly giddy over buffets anyways but this one just straight surpassed all my buffet dreams. . . Arrive early, you will wait in monstrous line if you do not. Prepare to be overwhelmed. Find the seafood section when you first enter, followed by country fare, brunch/breakfast indulgences, and then more ethnic offerings like Mexican and Asian (not sure if it changes day to day). Find the floating isle/dessert section off the side. Highlights of the buffet were crawfish, fried chicken in a waffle cone, freshly made doughnuts, truffle mushroom soup, prime rib, stone crab legs, and passion fruit cheesecake. Be ready to hit your 4th or 5th plate, 1 or 2 platefuls not enough for you to sample of the appetizing offerings.. . As gluttonous as this sounds, this buffet was maybe the highlight of our trip. Nothing quite like a vast selection of food and never ending mimosa pours to satisfy a pair of fat sibs.
we were there at 2nd of Dec, After reception brought us to the table, we waited 8 minutes to have someone came to serve us.. The food are extremely Salty. no matter Prime Rib, or Baby back rib, lamb chop, or ribs. ALL of them are salty, it is extremely salty. And on Asian food section, I would say the food quality are bad.They ONLY has Long crab leg, but no King Crab.. good thing on here is they use larger Shrimps to be cocktail shrimp.. . During the meal, the server seldom  came to us to take away the dirty dishes.. . The conclusion is I will not come back, $50.99/person should not like that.. 1 stars are  for $50.99 . another star for large cocktail shrimp.
As of now, this is by far my favorite buffet. From their king crab legs and fresh shrimps to their selection of Asian food and roasted meats, everything about this buffet is perfect. I came here for Thanksgiving dinner and just a word of advice to anyone who plans to eat here on a holiday: come early or else you won't be able to eat until 10 PM, or possibly even later.. . In terms of food and desserts and drinks, Bacchanal definitely has an exceptional selection, no doubt about that. I saw their macarons, cake pops, and doughnut gelato sandwiches and felt like I had died and gone to heaven. So why 3 stars and not the 5 stars that the chefs truly deserve? Well, while Bacchanal's food was amazing, their lines were inefficient and absolutely unfair. My family and I had obtained a ticket at ~2PM and were told to come back in 2.5 hours. At 4:30, we were asked to stand another 1.5 hours to pay and get seated. By 4:30, the wait time had gone from 2.5 hours to 5-6 hours, and it was then that people began to cheat the system and lined up in the VIP area to pay when they 1) were not a preferred member and 2) did not have the original tickets to begin with. The whole system was just ridiculous and no one from the management team seemed to notice, let alone do anything about it, so my family and I had to just stand and continue waiting as everyone cut their way inside the buffet.. . On top of that, our server was inattentive the entire time we were inside and ended up having to snatch the iced tea jugs from the server stands myself to refill my family's drinks. I understand that Thanksgiving day is a very busy day, but those are the days that establishments like Bacchanal make the most money, and those are the days that Caesar's needs their staff to be on their A game, not just to the parties of 15+ people. My parents usually tip our servers generously, but there was no excuse for the lousy service we had received that day, especially when that same server was so attentive to the tables surrounding ours. So while the food was some of the best I've ever had at a buffet, I would not come back unless they improved their management and quality of service.
Good food... Terrible service.. . Cashier was rude when we were paying for the buffet.. And when we got to the table, our server didn't bother to ask us if we want to have some drinks til we were done with our 2nd round of plates.. Terrible service...
It may be very expensive ($40+ for dinner, I think?) but it's the best buffet I've tried. There's an endless amount of items and no matter how hungry I am I never really feel like I've gotten my money's worth. As with all buffets, some items are hit or miss. On less busy nights dishes sit out longer than others and become cold and hard.. . The meatballs were great, the lamb was good, ribs had a rub with a rub made from a great blend of spices.The yellow curry chicken and barbequed Asian meats were delicious. The sushi, as at all buffets, should be avoided.. . Desserts are always the main draw for me, and theirs doesn't disappoint. The chocolate lava cake actually had a liquid center. The Oreo mousse and pecan tart were excellent compared to typical buffet quality dishes. Gelato flavors are diverse. The strawberry cheesecake was my favorite out of the ones I've tried.. . Again, it's expensive and if you're looking for a quality meal you'd be better off going to a regular restaurant. But, if you're looking for variety and just want to stuff your face silly, this is the buffet to go to.. . Lines are always long, but they have a kiosk system where you can check in and they'll text you when it's time to come back. Although when you do line up, you still have to wait in line to pay and to be seated.. . 4.5 Stars
Wow. That is all I can say. Wow.. . My family and I recently spent our Thanksgiving in Las Vegas since my cousins turned 21.. Of course, you have to celebrate in Las Vegas, for us Hawaii people it only makes sense at least.. . My other cousin told us that we have to eat at Bacchanal while we're here so we've decided to save this place for the day before we leave as our one last hurrah. Part of me wishes we came here first but the other part is glad we came here last. . . We got here around 430 pm on a weekday after being told that it shouldn't be too crowded and we'll beat the dinner rush. I'm so glad we came at that time because as we were dining, it slowly started to become more and more packed. We had a party of 9 so tip was already included to our bill so in total we payed about $50 each. Not too bad if you ask me, given the amount of food my family annihilated.. . The food... Oh goodness the food. The food there was so awesome that I can't even figure out where to begin for my review.. That's exactly how I felt when I was trying to figure out what dishes to start with! There was:. sushi:. Salmon Nigiri. Maguro Nigiri,. Hamachi Nigiri,. California Rolls,. Specialty Rolls,. . dim sum:. Char Siu bao. pork hash and other rolls. . mexican food, japanese food and korean food like kal bi, they even had a noodle station where you could make pho, ramen, saimin or udon. the pho was not bad.. after adding hoisin sauce it tasted a lot better. . . They have oysters, clams, jambalaya, and these cute chef specials where the food is served in these adorable little plates and pots. They even give you these silicon finger grips to grab the hot plates.. My mom and bestie, for some odd reason didn't feel like they needed those grips.. Oh how wrong they were.. I was standing there just watching them and then I hear, "Ow! Yeah, maybe we do need those grips"... If only they remembered that if they listened then they wouldn't have to learn the hard way...tsk tsk tsk... . You have to see the meat section... There's an area where one guy is cutting all of these meats.. They have prime rib, ribs either beef or pork, brisket, chicken, lamb and sausages.. If I had a drool emoticon then I'd add about 10 of them.  They have a taco station and all of these assorted mexican foods, I'm not too familiar with mexican food but my mom and aunty attacked that section! . . The desserts... I saw on a previous picture on Yelp that there was a macaroon section.. so here I am with the thought that I'd get some macaroons... Unfortunately I was wrong.. I'm  sure they change up the selections every once in a while but that time I went... was just not my time.. but they did have a crepe station, yerm.. Petite tarts and cake pops, bread pudding, gelato bar and cookies and lava cakes. . . They even had a juice section.. You could get guava, pineapple, and these other juices and they are served in these cute little milk bottles. Of course, the guava and pineapple juice tasted like nothing compared to what's at home but hey, I knew what to expect. . . Service was excellent! Su was our main server and she was just the best! We told her that two of our cousins were celebrating a birthday and she was so sweet and came out with a dessert plate for them and had the other staff members come and sing happy birthday to them. . . I know that the next time I come back to LV, I'm going to try this buffet for their brunch and lunch and come back for dinner.. all on different days of course... or not?? dun dun dunnnnnnn!!!
Best buffet in vegas! foods is so good!!!! You won't be disappointed
I was very disappointed maybe I was expecting a lot after I read the reviews the crabs legs are  very small , and at the Italian station they only have boiled " small crabs legs "and one Italian dish .yes, the do have a variety of pizza and good section of Asian food  but it not worth the high price of $51.00 I have been in much better ,cheaper and more variety place
I've attempted multiple times to get into this place but the waits have always been two hours or more. If you need to wait that long to try this place, just go else where bc its good but not worth that much time standing around. This time it didn't have a wait and really easy to get inside. Plenty of food choices and you will find something you like. The food was very good overall.
Everything was great except for their dessert. The lava cake was very over cooked and no chocolate lava flow because it was over cooked. And the cream brulee was under cooked. AWESOME seafood and Asian food. The Mexican menudo was so good. Dinner is different from lunch.  They have 2 different kinds of crab (Alaskan king and rock), oyster half, shrimp, prime rib and lamb, sushi (at both), they have more different pressed juices at dinner. We did the buffet of buffet (you can go to 6 different buffet as many times as you want within 24 hours). For the seafood buffet at Rio and Caesars you pay an extra free. Rio did have lobster. Your welcome :)
We went on a Thursday night. There was no line and it was mostly empty inside. My wife loved the crab legs and they had rock crab claws. The prime rib was very bland. They did have many things to eat but nothing special. They did have a very exotic Asian fruit like lychee which was the first I've seen. The dessert selection was ok. I don't think I will go back as I've have similar at Paris and Wynn.
My personal highlights about Bacchanal:. - Amazing seafood options: crab legs (cold or boiled), jumbo shrimp, ceviche and my absolute favorite - UNLIMITED half shelled oysters!! My goal was to eat 50 to recoup my cost but alas, I set myself up for failure...I only had 20...but no stomachache so that's a winner in my book!. - The taco bar: NOT FOR TACOS! The best thing about the taco bar is that you can make your own FRESH NACHOS! None of the pre-made crappy nachos that has been under the heat lamp. Grab some chips, ask the chef for some freshly grilled meat (carne asada was my choice) and drizzle on toppings galore at their amazing condiments bar. Fresh guac and pico de gallo was allllllll over my tasty nachos. . . What I disliked about Bacchanal: . - the price: $50+ for dinner, not including tax or tip (that puts you closer to $60+). There's a $15 price difference between lunch & dinner so definitely try to make the lunch-dinner transition if you can. I think dinner price starts around 3pm. Sucks that the price difference between weekday and weekend dinner is only a few bucks. . - the extremely sad Japanese selection: ummm...pre-made sushi roll with mushy rice???? Not worth my stomach space. . . - Use your total rewards card for $1 off and you get points!. - No wait for Monday night dinner. We got there around 4pm and the place was pretty empty..no lines at any of the station. Around 6pm-ish, the lines started to form at the seafood area and the carving area.
I usually stay clear of Asian buffet stations, since most places serve Panda Express style garbage. But to my surprise, Bacchanal's dishes are as real as they can get. No Orange Chicken or Chop Suey here. Instead, you'll find a great selection of dim sum, fresh sashimi, and even made-to-order noodles. Never in a million years, did I think I'd be enjoying congee and pho out in the middle of the desert. . . Buffets are a dime a dozen in Vegas, but what sets Bacchanal apart is the attention to detail they place on every dish. Nothing is prepared half assed.
Perhaps my favorite buffet since 2013.  It's got everything you need and surprisingly, their variety of asian food is quite delicious.  Every time I went it was for Sunday champagne buffet and they always had a nourishing soup available, whether it was ox tail, black chicken, ginseng chicken, or whatever, but it was soooo fulfilling after being hungover.  . . Aside from that, the seafood station is pretty standard yet good quality.  There's never a shortage of shrimp and crab and as I recall, I've seen oysters served at a certain point in time - just goes to show how they really rotate different items in and you can never really have the same thing each time you go back.  . . Overall, great variety, and good quality for the price.  I don't even need to go anywhere else knowing that I can count on Bacchanal to deliver a fine buffet meal with never ending champagne.  Also, they have the ticket system which eliminates the need to stand in line forever like the Wynn.  NO thanks.
~ $55 total including tax for one person on a Thursday evening. I loooove the selection of food here. I was not too happy about how salty a lot of the dishes were though, especially the seafood dishes. The oysters were fresh and sweet. They had stone crab claws that were not fresh and just tasted like... nothing... There is an area near the pizza and pasta (I know, weird that it's away from the seafood area) where you give the person a plate and theyll give you hot boiled snow crabs. The desserts were decadent. The molten lava cakes were a fail though, there was nothing oooozing out :( I actually went on 3 different occasions and it was like that every time. The gelato selection was bleh I went for the mochi icecream instead chocolate, green tea and mango.. Oh they take a souvenir photo of your group before they seat you but it cost some money if you want to purchase the photo.
This buffet reigns supreme. It used to be Wynn and bellagio but this buffet is a game changer. Fresh, quality ingredients. Diverse selections. Creative dishes. Gluttony at its best. I don't remember how many times I've been here but it seems like it's almost tradition every time I'm in vegas. I do like that they changed the waiting system. Instead of making you stand in a 2 hour line, they give you a ticket and tell you to come back around a certain time.  Is it cheap? Definitely not. But the food is completely worth every penny. The staff here is always very nice and accommodating. Impeccable cleanliness. Words can't describe how awesome this place is.
This trip marked our 3rd visit to the Bacchanel buffet, and it was just as fabulous as I'dremembered!  We'd considered another buffet (as we only chose one while on our Vegas trips), but other high-end buffet reviews on Yelp cautioned, " it was okay, but we wish we'd eaten at Caesers!".  Why ruin a good thing, so we went again!  If you LOVE seafood, this is your place!  I continue to be impressed with their cold AND steamed crab leg options as well as the huge cocktail shrimp (I swear they were even bigger this time). I'm not much for dessert, but it's a no brainer here.  Don't miss the gelato!  This time we tried  Salted Mexican Vanilla Bean and Coffee with Nutella.  I can't help but be impressed by their imaginative concoctions.  I'll rave again about the impressive gourmet cheese assortment as well as homemade guacamole and delicious selection of authentic dumplings and buns in the Chinese section.  . . We'll never choose another buffett Bacchanel!  Yours faithfully, Kelly.
Buffets will always be buffets. But some of the items here were higher end.  The sliders here were really good, along with the individual mini sea bass plates. The meats were too salty. Desserts are more elaborate then other buffets. Overall, it was ok for me. The sushi offered wasn't that great. I ended up eating a lot of crab legs to make up for the $50/person cost. The free coffee/tea/juice touch is nice. Server was nice as well.  Get here early. We thought no one would be eating at 4:30pm, we were wrong. Still had to wait a good 15-20 mins.
I don't see what people are talking about. There's another buffet that serves food by the spoonful, and its wicked that one would even mention them in the same category.. I liked the steamed crab legs and the fact that they offer real butter on the side was a plus. There was nothing else that really stood out. The sushi rolls were blah. Soups were salty. Mac and cheese lacked flavor. Baked chicken was undercooked and very pink inside.The oysters (Blue Point) were pathetic. What are they doing? Shucking them and putting the leanest ones out there? I looked that way compared to Blue Point oysters that we enjoyed at another hotel. Overall, the service was horrible. The excuse was that they were understaffed that day. We waited 15 minutes to get sodas, and never saw anyone offer a refill during our visit. Unacceptable. This is the world famous Caesar's Palace on the Las Vegas Strip. If they want to compete with some of the 5 star/diamond caliber places within walking (staggering) distance, they need to step it up. I might give them a second shot, but there is less than a 50% chance that I would even bother.
Look, it's a buffet, so there can't be too much to say about it. HOWEVER, the red velvet bread pudding was earth-shattering. Staff was great!
If buffets are your thing, then this is the place to go. Lot's of options, very fresh because of the massive volume of patrons. You will probably have to wait in line. A bit overpriced, but you can make up for it with crab legs alone
Oneof the best las vegas buffet as far as I remember.. But one thing I definitely like about this buffet is that the food is made freshly. It wasn't sitting there for a long time and not premade. Everything is made right there... . They have steamed crab  legs as well as cold crab legs. Oysters.. which u have to wait in line for. There's a crap load of dessert options, but they look better than they taste and was a disappointment. Pho was legit considering it's a buffet and tacos were made to order and tasted authentic. . . Their more gourmet food prepared in individual stainless mini pots tasted amazing: truffles mushroom polenta, squash ravioli, and more I can't remember... . As far as service.. it's decent except that they seem less happy compared to other buffets i've been to.
Sun, Dec 7, 8:50pm. . texts w/ my boyfriend:. . I've decided that I'm never coming home. I'm going to live here in the seafood section of the buffet, next to the drawn butter dispenser.. -----------------------------------------------. Where at?. -----------------------------------------------. Bacchanal inside of Cesar's Palace. I've had 4 plates of crab legs babe. I'm so happy
This is my Haiku review for the "Bacchanal Buffet" in Caesar's Palace.. . Extravagant food. Really bad Asian section. Overall p good
My favorite buffet in the whole world! It's a must every time I'm in Las Vegas. . . They literally have EVERYTHING! My favorite are obviously the fresh raw oysters. I love their ginseng chicken soup! And the ribs, the crab legs, the baked potatoes, just everything is so good! Did I mentioned their dessert station is full of good sweets. From cute little cupcakes to macaroons. And the ice creams have some unique flavors. (orange beer, mango habanero, etc) My mouth gets all watery every time I think about that buffet! Awww!!!. . Now if you are buying the buffet pass for 24 hrs, you'll need to pay additional EACH time you dine here. ($15 for breakfast, $25 for lunch and $35 for dinner) . . After dining here, all other buffets are shit. My favorite used to be the buffet at the Wynn, not no more!
Three words: DOUGHNUT GELATO SANDWICH . . I had two. :)  The doughnuts are equivalent to large doughnut holes, and the Mexican Vanilla Bean Salted gelato was the perfect creamy compliment.  The strawberry balsamic and lemon basil gelato were also delicious and refreshing.. . Despite this, both my husband and I agreed that the Oreo mousse was the best thing in the entire buffet.. . What sets this buffet apart from others in Vegas is its Asian section.  Sure, everyone has a salad bar, an Italian section, a meat carving station, and seafood.  Bacchanal has six or seven different dumplings, Korean-style ribs, pad thai, sushi, and more.. . We arrived at 11:30 AM on a Saturday morning in December, and only had a ten-minute wait or so.  Price was ~$45.00, and includes champagne.
this is one of the most expensive buffets I've been to but for the reviews I figured it was worth it. honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed. if you are big into Asian food, then come here it was outstanding. the desserts were great as well. the warm crab legs also good. everything else was just okay
Bring your appetite if you decide to go to this buffet because everything here is good. I think this probably sets the bar for Las Vegas buffets. It also helps if you know someone with one of those gold reward cards or whatever if you go during a busy time like Thanksgiving. It turned a 7+ hour wait to just less than an hour. The check-in system is good though if you're less fortunate one. Just enter your phone number into the kiosk setup they have and they'll text you when your place in the line is almost there. I would've never thought I would say eating brisket at a buffet would taste good but it's even better than some restaurants that serve it. Just quit eating food if you aren't impressed with the big selection of food here.
This was my first Vegas buffet experience in many years, and I was not disappointed. We came on a Sunday around 12pm for brunch and there was only about a 5-10 minute wait. The cost was $45/person and included unlimited mimosas. Our server was really sweet and did a great job explaining where everything was located. I was overwhelmed with how many different food options there were, and I wanted to try everything if only my stomach space would allow it. I loved the meat and seafood sections the most. Steak, shrimp and crab are the three things I could probably eat everyday for the rest of my life, and they were plentiful at Bacchanal.  My favorite starch was the truffled scallop potatoes. I need to find myself the recipe because it was that good. In the dessert section, I tried the carrot cake which was good. The chocolate lava cake however was overcooked and burnt on the edges. You definitely can't go wrong with the gelato. I really liked the Nutella and strawberry balsamic flavors. The best part of dessert were the cupcakes. They had the perfect amount of sweetness and were super moist. Thanks Bacchanal for the food baby that appeared under my shirt. It was well worth it.
Ok so here's the thing. is it crazy expensive? absolutely. Is there a crazy amount of food? absolutely. Honnestly, I'm not sure if I go again but there's a good chance I will. The thing is, what you're paying for is the selection of tons of food to chose from. However, there's no possible way you're going to eat all of it so even though it's all you can eat, you only eat about maybe 50-60% of what is there (you preferences + your stomach space). That said, the food is really delicious and it's definitely not your average buffet. If you go to vegas, and feel like spending the money then I'd say go for it. I will probably go once and only once when I go back to vegas. It's not something you need to spend on more than once in one trip. Also, just like with everything in vegas, call ahead before you go there to figure out the price and don't trust the websites. Prices change depending on time of day and day of the week.
First off...wow. The variety here is ridiculous. Just when you turn the corner and expect nothing left but salad you are surprised with another ethnic spectrum of cuisine. . . The quality of everything is good but not fantastic. The effort of presentation is great though, however. Only reason that I gave this place 4 stars was because the price is ridiculous. $115 for two people? I mean the place is good...but not thaaaaaaaat good. . . All in all if you only get this place once in a while it's great to try. However, if you are here in Vegas all the time than this could get pricy.. . They give out meal tickets once it starts getting busy, which is really just a ticket that tells you what time you can get in line. In other words, come in the off season or prepare to wait.
Ok everyone was right.. This place is freaking awesome!. . The VARIETY! WOW~! Totally worth for what I paid for!. The seafood part was the best! The shrimp were jumbo size and fresh, including the juicy half shell oysters! Could't get enough of it!. . I love how they had Korean Kalbi, it was extremely tendered. The sushi was pretty good, and ginseng chicken soup was legit! Tasted like my grandmothers cooking! The macaroons...wow where do I start! The quality of those deserts were way better than some of the bakeries I've been to. I've tried the Ramen & the Udon and they were both pretty good as well.. . But the seafood man... that was the best thing at the buffet~
My favourite buffet on the strip! It is absolutely delicious and worth the price. So much variety in food and amazing quality. Wouldn't come to Vegas without missing on a meal here.
We don't "do" buffet very often, but while we were checking out the various casinos, we took the time to check out a few - and quickly determined this one is far and away the best of the bunch... but not twice as good as the half price competition next door behind the lake if you know what I mean.. . Fresh oysters in the desert? Why not, it's Ceasars. . Snow crab legs, hot or chilled, plenty of each and conveniently cut in half for you.. Smoked brisket, in house overnight, incredible and only one of 6 items in the carving station.. So many choices, so little stomach real estate. The trick is to get just a bite of many things, if you fill your plate with your favorite, you'll be missing out on a hundred other items. . . Don't forget to save room for dessert, because those choices are equally enticing, including a gellato bar with a half dozen flavor choices.. . All said and done, we agreed it was the best of the genre, and I guess Ceasars knows it and charges for it. We actually were not going to go, but we won a couple hundred bucks in the casino, and decided it was "free", so what the heck. . . For a special night out, I highly recommend it. Everything was really good and nothing sits boiling on steam trays, which is what turns me off about buffet in general. Service is polite and professional.. . Downside - because of what it is, you might spend time in line waiting for your favorite offering. People are in constant motion, so the traffic next to your table is brisk. Soft drinks included, you'll get another bill on your table if you order something else. (Sparking water was $5)
Out of everything I atehere, my most favorite was this raspberry macaron with lychee ganache. . . Everything else - prime rib, crab legs, shrimp, etc. was nothing out of the ordinary of your regular buffet. I did like the assortment though as the dishes were more thought out (ie: the salad bar isn't just a bowl of leaves, but endive salad with shrimp or something like that). They also had a juice bar..the guava juice was delicious!. . Pricey - $58 for dinner buffet.
I rated this 4/5 stars back in April 2013.  The last time I was here was about year ago when I recall it was still good but the novelty had worn off.  My recent visit this week confirmed that I probably won't be coming back again in the future.  Although there was surprisingly no line at all at 7pm on a Wednesday night, inside the restaurant it feel crowded with the usual lines at the popular stations.. . In the past, I mainly came to Bacchanal for the seafood station and meat carving station.  During this visit, both of these stations were underwhelming.  The pickings were slim at the King Crab station, and the shrimp cocktail looked and tasted like the previously frozen variety of mediocre quality.   The brisket was much too fatty.  The ribs were not tender.  The tonkatsu ramen station was also previously a favorite.  Now, they do not use Japanese style slow cooked pork in the ramen but rather very common Chinese style char-siu.  The Italian station used to have small individual cast iron dishes (similar to Wicked Spoon) with tempting looking specialties.  Those small cute cast iron dishes are no longer used.  The desserts looked good but were mediocre too.  This was an altogether disappointing meal.  It's too bad that the quality of the best buffets in Vegas are outstanding when they are new but then go downhill after the first couple of years.  3 stars now would be generous, especially considering the $50+ price.
Love Bacchanals. I've eaten there plenty of times and each time its consistent, haven't disappointed me yet. Its a lil over priced but you pay for quality.  Nothing that the Bellagio buffet or Wicked Spoon couldn't provide. I would say the dessert buffet is the best part.  Crepes made to order, gelato ice cream and delicious Asian inspired flavors in their desserts.... . The part I don't like about Bacchanals is even though people aren't waiting for the carving station will wait in line just to wait, I suppose...oh well more for me to NOT wait in line for the other food. . . Service can be a lil on the slow side esp during their champagne brunch. Servers can sometimes take their time with refilling your champagne or mimosa. Other than that its a decent buffet and worth every dollar you spend esp if you love to eat.
Best buffet in town!!! I have tried many buffet in town. This one is a must to go!!! Great presentation, a lot of variety. Because I like sea food, so I prefect dinner here. Crab leg, oyster, shrimp cocktail, lobster soup...etc. Scallops potato and Kobe burger are must to try. Desert station is a food paradise! After my first visit, I never want to go to any other buffet in town.
They offer large selection of all kind of food.. Food is good but it remains a buffet, it's not a 5 star restaurant.. . You can choice from pizza, pasta, sushi, seafood, meat, fish, vegetables, pretty much everything... For desert, they offer pastries, fruits, cakes.. . You end up being very full after this buffet.
Don't get tricked by the "We'll text you when your table is ready" text message sent to your cell phone on weekends. The quote from the front check-in lady, "Look at the line. There's NO way we can text you." So the rule goes - Use the kiosk to print the estimated wait time ticket to return later. You can't go in without the ticket. You can't go in when the time on your ticket hasn't got close/passed yet. . . We arrived around 4:30pm and got a ticket for 5:54pm on Sat. 12/20. We asked the check-in lady about our wait status around 6:00pm because we'd never received the text message as promised. The lady Vesna was very rude. She told us not to cut the line when we tried asking her the question. She just said to line up all the way in the back of the line regardless of whatever time was printed on our ticket. We then checked with another staff. He told us about the policy above.. . We printed another ticket from the kiosk at 6ish just to check on the wait time. It says the wait time is about 185 minutes = 3 hours. It means you can line up at 9:05pm and wait for another hour. Go early! . . ***** Food: 4 STARS!!!!!. Fresh seafood - crab legs, shrimps, raw oysters, and various cooked mussels and clams. The sushi there is good too.. . I love the pistachio ice cream; you can taste real pistachio pieces in it.  The dessert presenation is pretty and elegant. The cake/pie/flan portion size is perfect for one so no leftover will be wasted. . . The reason for 1 star off is because the meat section was a bit weak. The lamb was too gamey for my sister-in-law, who usuallyloves lamb. The baby back ribs were dry. It's too bad the prime rib was not available during Sat. dinner hours. The only thing that was good is the beef brisket.
When I read that the Bacchanal Buffet was the best on the strip with many food options, I was really excited to try it.  However, I have to say that it is VERY OVERRATED.  We had to wait in line for half an hour (which I sort of expected).  They had lots of seafood (if you are into oysters and crab) and many slabs of meat.  If you aren't crazy about that type of seafood or meat, you will probably be disappointed.  Yes, they have many "worldly" dishes, but they are all generic food (pizza, pasta, generic sushi, dim sum and Chinese food).  They did have Pad Thai, which was a little more unique, but being from California, it's nothing really special.  They also didn't have very many vegetable dishes and their salad bar was disappointing.  On the bright side, they did have many desserts to choose from (including the fuzzy Chinese lychees).  However, they did not have my favorite tiramisu.. . Don't get me wrong, the food was good.  The lamb was tender and juicy.  It's just not amazing.  I've tasted better food at the buffets at  other casinos in Reno and Sacramento for half the price.  If the price wasn't so expensive ($50+ for dinner), I probably would have given it 4 stars, but it's really not worth the price.  If you are going to spend that much money anyways (and don't eat a whole lot of food), I would spend a little more, and walk a little farther to the Top of the World at The Stratosphere for a much better dining experience.
Love it! Only reason I dont give this buffet 5 stars is becaus alcohol is not included... At $55.00 per person for dinner on a Thursday you would think they offer AT LEAST one comped drink. Nonetheless, always a phenomenal selection of foods and it will definitely be a special place in my books ;)
Long ago, in a land known as Norrath, I was a level 60 half-elf assassin. Meanwhile, in the non-online world that is known as real life, I was a fat teenager.. . While I may have slayed the titan of a teen that I used to be, his soul lives on in my now chiseled body. Every once in a while, I let the elven assassin take over my body, and most recently, he did so at the Bacchanal Buffet.. . You ever been to Disneyworld's Epcot Center with all the countries? That's the buffet.. . - Mexicoland. Tacos, pozole, salsas, guacamole. - Chinapan (Chinese and Japanese food are next to one another). Dim sum, stir fried dishes, hot and sour soup, sushi. - Poseidonstan (not at Epcot). Crabs, shrimp, fish, more crabs, more shrimp. - Italia. Pizza, pasta, charcuterie. - 'Merica. Prime rib, barbecue, Freedom. . And then, off the boonies, lies Carblandia. Cheesecake, gelato, chocolate, caramel, sundaes, cupcakes, cake pops, tarts, and fruit.. . I, or should I say the elf, ate until it was impossible to consume another bite. I was literally in pain from the amount of food I consumed. I received a status message "You are too encumbered to move!". . Yeah. I'm aware. And it's okay. Cause it's Vegas.
Not worth the $55 per person which we paid last night.  For kids under 10, it's half price, $35 I believe.  As some other reviews indicated, I concur that it's not worth waiting close to an hour which we did.  Supposedly, a text will be sent once you get a ticket (kind of like the fastpass system at Disneyland), but as the receptionist explained, everybody showed up with tickets a little earlier than they were supposed to, so she had "no time" to text people.  Of course, it might have been that we showed up around 6PM on the Saturday prior to Xmas.. . I'm not much of a seafood eater, so I was able to avoid another line waiting for seafood once I made it past the initial line to pay, and then the secondary line to wait to be seated.  However, even at the carved meats section, there was another line.  Just out of principle, I refused to stand in line, but my daughters and wife were kind enough to do so for me, while they were getting stuff they wanted to eat.. . So I ate from the Chinese/Asian section where there wasn't much waiting.  They did have ginger ale to drink, and the mango juice from the Mexican/Latino section was great.  The dessert section was awesome too, but that's really the only thing that impressed me.. . So if you basically only eat cooked land animals and like dessert, paying $55 is probably not worth it.  And as far as the "fastpass" system is concerned, I think everybody gets a ticket now, so it's not exactly like an advantage.
***Over Rated!****. 3 hour wait with high expectations., but were disappointed.  We have tried many vegas buffets and were expecting Bacchanal to hold its own like Wynn's buffet, but was more like MGM's, or maybe Rio's buffet.  $56.99 per person.  crab was big, but same size as elsewhere.  The carving station looked awesome, lamb chops were good, but the prime rib was tough. Noodle bar was okay...  We basically had a $32.99 buffet dinner for $56.99.  We will not be returning here.
Not worth the wait or the money plus horrible service. Don't bother upgrading with buffet of buffets pass either....the upgrade fee is per visit and they don't even inform you of that fact!!  Disappointing on all levels!
Came for the buffet on Saturday, 12/20/14. The staff here is extremely rude!!! We arrived around 4:30pm and printed a ticket that estimated our seating time for 6:13pm. The text message I received confirmed our estimated seating time and said that I would be receiving a text several minutes before seating. By 6:20pm, the gf and I were starving and decided to show up and ask about our seating. I asked one of the staff members (buff dude with no hair) where to check-in, and he had the worst attitude you could imagine.. . This guy sounded miserable. I'm sure he was just annoyed by people asking him questions, but isn't that his job? I mean he just stands there, so what else is he getting paid to do? He didn't even let me finish and replied, "just wait in that line" as he lazily pointed to the line to check in. His words trailed off, almost as if he had fallen asleep while talking to me. . . I wait in that line another hour before reaching Vesna. She was just as bad as the bald guy. I asked if there was a problem with seating since I never received a text message to return for seating. This was around 7:30 now - over an hour past our estimated seating time. She said, "Yeah, we're not sending text messages today." WHAAAT?! I got the first text message. Why the hell are you not sending the second? She said "We are busy. It's the holidays." It's supposed to be an automated system! Why are you telling people to wait for a text that never comes? This is ridiculous! Never an apology or an ounce of sympathy. She just said "everyone else is waiting too!" My point was that they should not be telling people to wait for a text if it wasn't going to come. Also, the estimated seating time just means you need to come back to wait longer. This defeats the purpose of having the automated system. It was a little past 8:30pm when we finally sat down. Yup. 4 hour wait.. . The only Reason I am leaving 3 stars is cause the food was good. Some of the meats were over-cooked and over-seasoned, but other than that, the selection was awesome and our server was great. He made sure our drinks were never empty. The "holiday dinner" seemed to be almost identical to their regular menu. It just cost a bit more. It was $56.99. If you include tax and tip, you're looking at over $70-something per person. They say you can skip the line for another $25, but really, you're just waiting in a shorter line (with all the people that pay extra).
My boyfriend, my parents and I went to the Bacchanal for Champagne Brunch this past Saturday and it was almost as good as when we went for Christmas two years ago. We arrived around 10:00 am and there was no wait and I'm actually glad we got there early because when we left around 11:30 there was a huge line and they were directing people to the kiosks where you sign up and come back at a later time (kind of like fast passes at Disney). The reason that I say "almost as good" is because the eggs benedict that I got was cold :(. However, I give them five stars for their  crab legs! I didn't know that you could ask them to steam them - so much better than ice cold, in my opinion. And they were delicious!! I like my crab legs with just lemon, none of that butter stuff - but if you want it, it's there. The prime rib was on point and the dim sum was good as well. I also really enjoyed their made to order crepes at the dessert station. I get mine with just nutella but they have all of the fruit toppings also. Our server Maria was awesome and constantly kept our mimosa glasses full. If you go, ask to be in her section - she will definitely take care of you. As total rewards members we paid $43.99 per person which is definitely pricey but we really enjoyed it.
Never disappoints! This is hands down the best buffet in Vegas. Yes it is pricey, but you get exactly what you pay for- the food is excellent & good quality. Huge variety, great desserts, large seating area. They have something similar to a "fast pass" at disneyland in the front of the buffet where you enter your name & amount of people in your party, then it will give you a return time. This is waaaay better than standing in line for 2 hours! Very efficient. Excellent experience. Had to roll myself out as usual.
Let me get this out of the way - I hate buffets.  I truly, truly hate buffets and the whole concept.  At the time I visited Bacchanal I was starving and my husband is a lover of buffets so there's a little bit of a conflict.  I was originally very weary of the price but we came on a day that was NOT the weekend so the prices were much MUCH cheaper.  We were seated quickly and the service was friendly.  There is a variety of foods (as it should be) and the food is changed frequently for the most part.  There were a few experiences where the food was cold but for the most part I enjoyed my experience.  This experience however, hasn't changed my mind about buffets in general, but if you are like me and can't stand buffets - this may be the one...and only one you may enjoy.
My family and I got here at 7:45 pm on Thursday.  When we were taken to our seats near the back next to a large wedding table party and a another large party table, we sat and I immediately left the table and went to get some meat and seafood.  The line to get both were unbelievable-10 to 15 minute waits each.  I couldn't believe it!!  You wait in line to get in now you have to wait that long just to get meat & seafood for food that is already prepared.  Maybe it was the customers in line because I saw tons of workers in the preparation area.  Also, the seating in the restaurant was super cramped with very few aisle ways to get around.  Seemed like Caesars does care about the people's experience once the get inside the restaurant.  I paid $50+ for this!!  . . Positives:  I will say there was only 1 or 2 people in line when getting the hot crab legs so the wait was minimal if not quite fast.  The crab legs were cut in half making it super easy to eat, but the legs were small though.  there were no lines/minimal people at the salad and Asian food area.  I rarely eat desserts but my wife said the desserts were excellent.  I will say the lady taking care of our table was super.  She did a great job keeping our table clear and was proactive in refilling our drinks and giving us warm towelettes, almost anticipating our every move.. . Having to stand in line for so long definitely impacted how I viewed the food.  I was alright.  Nothing special.  . . I guess people want to get their money's worth and skip everything but the seafood and carved meat.  I've seen good review about this place but based on my experience, my family and I will not be back.
Pretty good food, HUGE range of selection, comfortable ambiance, fabulous customer service, by far the best buffet we had in Vegas.
4 stars is a little bit generous. It really deserves between 3 and 4 stars. Came at around 11 am. Even 2 hours later there are still too many breakfast items being served. There are many different choices which warrant 4-star rating, but the food quality is just slightly above average. Sushi options are limited and very average. Asian items are not anything outstanding. Crab legs are definitely not king crabs, no more special than other buffets in Vegas. It is worthwhile to try it once, but not something I would look forward to in the future.
Well I never expected to give this buffet a bad review but my experience going to try it did not work out as I had hoped or expected.  It was a weeknight at 8:30pm when we got there with a party of three.  The line was long, just passed the first hostess stand.  I went to the kiosk to "put our name in" and it said to come back at 9pm.  We got in the line that wasn't moving and the host lady came through the line looking at everyone's ticket.  When she got to us she told us to get out of line and come back at 9pm.  That doesn't make sense because by the time we would pay it would have been at least 9pm.  AND the couple in front us had a ticket that said 8:55pm.  So she asked us to get out of line when the people in front of us has a ticket with a 5 minute difference but they were ok.  The lady was so rude, she was short, older, with short gray hair.  We were so disgusted by her rudeness that we left and didn't even eat there.  When you are asking people to pay almost $60 for a buffet you should at least treat them nicely.
WTF the line is hella long! Like I get it it's a kinda new buffet but srsly Wow! I like what they do with the machines so ppl can go look around instead of fucking standing for 3 hrs like the the bellagio but the staff in front is horrible we were in the front of the line and waited 30 minutes
No matter what time you come here you have to wait at least 3 hours...........but if you pay extra 25 dollars you only need to wait about a hour........ so weird , won't come back anymore........ by the way , the food are just so so too
The lines were crazy long. If you are a meat and seafood lover, this place is worth the money. Bottomless mimosa, crab legs, oysters, meats of all sorts, and on and on. All the food tasted great. Too bad they were out of macaroons. Overall, I highly recommend this place, especially during the weekend when they serve crab legs and oysters for lunch.
The different foods are hit or miss. I commend the asian section for its efforts - but the dim sum was sub par, and the char siu was decent. We expected more from the reviews and the price tag. We went for lunch, and even then, we felt we paid more than necessary for the rude service and unimpressive food. A lot of the presentation of the food is wonderful. The aisles are clean, most of it was fresh and hot. There are no spills or stickiness on the counter tops, and all the chefs pay close attention to these things. Our waitress came by maybe twice to refill our soda/water. The other waitresses were loud, talked among their coworkers rudely about customers, and we had to ask one where our waitress was, since we hadn't seen her in a while. The only exception to the customer service was the woman at the entrance of the buffet. She had a great attitude and was exceptionally kind to us. . . We tried almost everything on the buffet. The Mac & Cheese was nothing to write home about, though the Kobe sliders were great and were restocked multiple times during our hour visit. I quite liked the "American" section. The sweet potato pots were fantastic, and the veggies were well cooked and delicious. The salad bar, like any salad bar, had fresh ingredients and there was a large array to choose from. With the price tag, that's to be expected. The meats were cooked really well, though the prime rib could have been a bit better. There were made to order tacos and fajitas. I enjoyed these a lot, and the salsa & chips to go with it. They also included drinks that you wouldn't normally find out and about, such as fresh fruit juices squeezed into decorative plastic bottles. We tried the Watermelon and it was very good. Down the line, you'll find Italian eats. I was unimpressed with the selection there. There was a lasagna, and 3-4 other types of pasta. All of them were unfamiliar to me and most were spicy. The selection bummed me out quite a bit. I tried a spoon full of everything, and I'd say definitely pass on the Italian during lunch periods. The seafood was just seafood. Nothing horrible, nothing special. The desserts were where I was the happiest. There were some that were inconsistent with the sweetness and lacked any luster, but others were spot on. I really enjoyed this area of the buffet, particularly the cheesecake, brownies, fudge, and creme brule. . . The biggest wow factor is just the sheer amount of food available. Next to that, the presentation is quite pretty. I won't say that it's bad food. It just wasn't all that spectacular. The dining area is clean and quite large, so you don't feel cramped or stuffed in. The decor is simple and elegant, and strays away from the overly garish that gives Las Vegas its reputation. That being said, we went to other buffets in Vegas, such as the MGM, and I preferred the flavors there to hundreds of dishes that mostly miss. The Bacchanal puts on a hearty display, but falls short in key areas such as seafood and ethnic foods. We blamed it on coming during the lunch hour, presuming that had we chosen dinner, the foods would have been prepared with a lot more finesse.
Incredible selection, wonderful service, and all the food is well prepared and tastes great. Love this place!
UI came here last night and they had the holiday dinner which included King Crab Leg in the holiday menu. The main purpose I came here is to eat the King Crab Leg, I was very disappointed when I found there is NO such thing at the buffet. The people at Seafood section pointed us to Italian section for King Crab Leg, but the people at Italian section asked us to check with Seafood section. They were both handing out Snow Crab Legs, NOT KING CRAB LEGS. Sooo disappointed. If you don't have it, don't put it on your menu to trick people. LIE. If you want to try King Crab Legs, DO NOT come here. . . Moreover, if you like sushi, you will be disappointed as well. The rice was so dry. NOT GOOD.. . Positive side: Snow crab legs and Oysters are good and fresh. Meat is goodd. Desert are great and the fresh juice is good. . . Overall, I will NOT pay over $60 (with tax) to come eat here again. Specially the wait is so long,  it's NOT worth it.
Went for the holiday dinner for the first time at Bacchanal Buffet due to hearing all the hype.. . The ticket system says they'll reserve you a time to come back, and they'll text you. Minimum wait time was 2-3 hours when we went, but expect to wait for another hour in line once you've been texted.. . The advertised "King Crab" legs were simply snow crabs, which was much lower quality. Oysters ran out quick and a bunch of people were being sent back and forth between stations, a lot of guests were complaining to staff about this.. . The Mexican station had ice cold tacos and other soggy  plates, which no one bringing out fresh dishes.. . Sushi consisted of hard rice and stale tasting fish for the nigriri.. . I would advise all to stay away from the "Vietnamese Pho" and Udon, as both smelled extremely foul and toxic, similar to industrial chemicals. I didn't think either soup bases can turn out so bad.. . Not worth the $60 per person, very few items were edible, letalone "good".
One word-AMAZING. Endless food and yummy treats you can't get enough of. Should have started with the Asian entrees then worked my way to the Italian. They had make your own ramen and pasta station which both were just simply delicious.
I came here with 3 coworkers on a Saturday around 11am after a long night of drinking. There was no wait at all when we got there but the line was pretty long when we left around 1pm. Everything there was amazing and definitely worth $50/person. Everyone in our group enjoyed every bite of our food especially the desserts.. . To get your money worth you should definitely get the king crab legs and stone crab claws. You can either have it cold or have them warm it back up in the boiling water. I loved the stone crab.. . You must also get some prime ribs! There are also dim sum and sushi if you walk further down.. . I suggest that you try a little of everything since they are all amazing! You must save some space for dessert. You will not regret it!
For just under $60/person, it's worth it! Get here early though, or the waits gonna be at least an hour! I came here on Friday around 5 pm and my table of 4 was seated immediately. . . The juices in glass milk mugs are spot on and the seafood was the highlight. Had at least two plates of snow crab legs and there's another section where you get them hot too! Crab legs can already cracked open. Oysters and mussels were also fresh. . . Most other foods were hit or miss though. The sushi was sub par, pho was excellent, ramen was mediocre quality..so I recommend trying a little bit of everything. The variety was great and had wide selection.
Great food, great selection, awesome service.  Definitely worth the price and the wait.
Holiday pricing does not equal holiday menu! NONEXISTENT king crab legs left us paying $60/person for just snow crab legs. Bellagio had king crab for 75% of the price.. . There were definitely a lot less than 500 items at this buffet, unless they are counting soy sauce and other condiments as an "item." Buffet was a lot smaller than expected. . . The whole kiosk ticket thing makes your day revolve around the buffet. The later wait times were 400 minutes + and then you wait for another two hours to pay... And then another line to get seated...and more lines inside for food. We invested 7 hours total from start to finish.. Not worth it when you're on a time crunch or just not worth your sanity, period. Lots of people didn't even know about this ticket thing and it's not even mentioned on the website. That's very poor communication. I only knew about it because of my fellow yelpers. Heart!. . Food was hit or miss. The lamb chops were very well prepared, but the cod was dryer than brawny paper towels. Some of the dishes had been sitting under the light for so long, they hardened and dried out. The deserts were disappointing, although the gelato was decent.. . One time is enough.. And even that is a Rip off. I think Studio B is still one of the best value buffets. Alcohol included in the $15.99 weekday lunch buffet.
Getting straight to the point, today's meal at the prominent Bacchanal Buffet was absolutely terrible. . . 1. As you may have heard from previous reviews, the ticket that you receive upon reaching the restaurant does absolutely nothing for the wait time. The "text" that they were supposed to send to notify us of when we were supposed to be at the restaurant did not arrive and was a complete waste of time. Even though we arrived at the restaurant earlier than others to receive this ticket, those who received the ticket after us were somehow able to be seated before us, thus making the ticket very much useless. After being presented the ticket, the woman in front, as well as the ticket, very clearly stated that we were to come back at that specific time after receiving the text message to be seated. Fair enough. After wandering the streets of Las Vegas for almost 4 hours, which was apparently the wait time for the restaurant, we returned to the buffet, only to find the huge line awaiting us, not to mention that we never received any form of message from the business. Convinced that we were able to get in sooner because of the ticket, we asked the same lady in front and she just quickly pointed us to the back of the line and left. Still utterly confused, we asked around only to understand that the ticket was not a pass to be seated earlier, but just a piece of paper to show that we were eligible to get in, meaning that we still needed to wait in line to be seated. We then waited in the never-moving line for about 1.5-2 hours before finally being able to see the inside of the restaurant. It was around 9:30 or so and with still so many people behind us and the restaurant closing in about half an hour, we were at our limits. What should have been a relaxing dinner with family was rushed and uncomfortable for everyone. Technically, the time we spent waiting for the text, a thorough explanation, and the line was actually around 6 hours, which is a huge amount of time for the quality of food that was served there. Not satisfied at all. . . 2. After finally being seated half an hour before the advertised closing time, we immediately went to get food, filling our plates with as much as we could take, expecting the food to be absolutely delicious, but sadly we were once again very wrong. Throughout the meal, the food was at most mediocre and most likely able to be bought at any restaurant in our home town, making us instantly regret our decision to spend more than $200 on the place. A lot of the food tasted overcooked, burnt, and almost vomit-worthy. After barely eating anything and having spent a tremendous amount of money, we just left, with still many people left eating/unseated. I would have described the food there to be leftovers from a trashy restaurant if I did not know where it actually came from, though the argument still stands. . . It's overrated and the management for crowds sucks. Don't go here.
Good food, long wait. You have to give yourself at least 2 hours to stay in line. . . The crab legs were great but I thought the prime rib was so so. They have a great selection of food and desserts and everything I've tried was pretty good.
OH MAN OH MAN BACCHANAL BUFFET.. . I've been dreaming of this for awhile. We came for dinner at 1 pm but it was brunch and the wait would be two hours once you put it in the reservation machine. Perfect because dinner food starts at 3 anyway. . . Decided to go shopping got a call on our phone and literally ran to the buffet from Express. The only time I run.. . It was crowded. Holiday pricing was $63 per person. It was pricey but that is okay because we ate our money's worth and more.. . Everyone has a different idea of how to eat their money's worth in buffet food. Some ate a bite of everything. Some eat their worth in dessert. Me? . . . King crab legs, oysters, shrimps every seafood imaginable. So that's the first thing we went for. Mussels good, clams not as good as mussels, salmon was delish, crab legs bomb.. . Then we went for the MEAT. The line was kind of long but that's okay cause we delegated tasks. I got in line while my friend went to grab things to eat in line. We ate a whole plate of food in line. No shame. Oysters were yummy better than the ones I had at palace station the night before. Salami yummm and cheese. . . The meat was all right. Too salty and over seasoned on the outside. I'm not a big fan of lamb. Turkey was okay. BEEF RIBS were my FAV. . . I heard tacos were good. Desserts hit or miss depending on what you like but there's so many you are bound to eat something you like. . . . . Some tips: . Eat fast so you don't feel how full you are.. Don't eat carby things like rice pasta bread you will get full too fast. . Drink water to wash down everything.. Go for your favorite thing first before you get too full to eat it. . Take breaks you are allowed to be there for two hours but they probably won't notice if you're there for like four five. . . . . Happy feasting!!
Longest line for food I have ever seen. Took me 2 hours to get in. But the food totally deserve the wait! Everything is excellent!! The beef, shrimp and desert are the best! You have to try it if you are in vegas!
The foods are suck. We expect a good quality food but it did not happen in this buffet. TAKE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. If u want to eat crab with ice, then enjoy.
Hate your line system. Already paid but still a 40-50 min wait. Ridiculous. This is one of my favorite places to eat but the line is so hideous that I really hate you
Not worth the wait! Over 6 hour wait time. Lol. The food is really good, but it is taking longer to get seated. We checked in at 3:45pm on Friday and the estimated seating time was at 10:37pm. They close at 10pm!! The self check-in is useless. When they text you to come in, you still have to wait at least another hour just to pay and get seated. Dinner starts at 3pm. So check in 3-5 hours earlier in a Friday.
Good varieties on their dinner buffet. Kinda pricey compared to the other buffets but definitely one of the better ones on the strip
The best buffet I've been to (i've yet to try Bally's Sterling Brunch). I hate going to buffets and AYCE places. I always end up over eating to justify the cost. However, this buffet is something else. I wanted try this buffet since I had heard so many rave reviews about it. And it lived up to my expectations.. . Just like any other buffets on the strip Bacchanal has Asian, American, French and Seafood. The must tries are American (burger sliders are delicious), Seafood (crab legs), French (pastries for dessert) and you have to try their lamb chops. I think managed to eat 10 of those at this buffet. The seasoning on the lab chops is perfect. . . The final stop is the dessert bar. They probably have over 75 different varieties of desserts and fruits. Just try anything from here. . . Overall, I'll definitely be back to break my current record of lamb chops. You should't skip this. Best time to get in is on Weekday nights. Use the automated kiosks to save waiting time.
They kick ppls out of the line becoz we don't have enough ppls at the middle of the line. The servants have very bad attitude too.
The reservation system is great. They text you 15 minutes prior to availability and you wait in another line to pay but honestly very organized.  We went for Christmas brunch and I put my name down at 10 am, we were seated by 1045.  By 1230 there was a 7 hour wait. OUCH.  Go early.  Favorites was the crab and seafood and the sliced meats.  Soups were great.  Bad thing is the placeis so big that hot food is barely warm by the time you sit down to eat it.  Service was amazing!  Like I said well organized.
Their mini-fingertip tongs to pinch and move hot plates is a cute idea.. . Bacchanal can be defined as:. 1. an occasion of wild and drunken revelry.. 2. a priest, worshiper, or follower of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine.. 3. one of the top voted Las Vegas buffets. . It all ties in nicely with the Caesar's Palace and Roman/Greek mythology theme. I haven't read much on ancient stories lately, other than watching reruns of the original Clash of the Titans movie. All I remember is that Zeus is a slut, Medusa is frightening, and that the magical, mechanical owl was the neatest sidekick before R2D2 was activated.. . While engaging in the usual cabbie chit chat, our driver mentioned that the two most popular Vegas buffets were Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon. I would have been content at visiting either, but going with the flow we ended up here. I do like that they use a Fastpass system, so that you can check in, pick up a ticket, leave, and return during your scheduled time window. You might still be in a line, but at least you're not standing around getting hangrier the entire wait time.. . Hours:. Breakfast M-F 7:30a-11a. Champagne Brunch Sat-Sun 8a-3p. Lunch Daily 11a-3p. Dinner Daily 3p-10p. . Price range is $30-$50+ depending on the time of day and in consideration of holiday pricing.. . The available offerings are quite impressive. While I'm not too critical of buffets in general (since the kitchen's goal is to mass produce quickly) the Bacchanal menu raises the bar on the Vegas standard and does a nice job of serving up some tasty dishes. Not everyone has an extensive buffet menu that includes an international variety of comfort food, street snacks, and fancy fare; or an amazing dessert bar, with gelatos, macarons, and gluten-free options (oh my!), that can satisfy any sweet tooth. I wish I had more room in my tummy because I wasn't able to sample a bite of everything. Being a popular AYCE hotspot, the visitor traffic is a usually good sign of dishes being made freshly to keep their various stations stocked up.. . Service was efficient as expected. We didn't visit much with our waitress other than the initial drink order. Plates were cleared often and glasses refilled regularly.. . You can try to gameplan your meal, but once you see what's going on at the Bacchanal Buffet, you might lose your mind or have a temporary lapse of restraint and start piling your plate in a frenzy like when you chugged and triple-fisted drinks when it was last call. That's ok, it's your occasion and you're here to indulge.
First time I tried this buffet was about a year ago.  We were here for dinner and waited about an hour and a half to get seated which is not bad.  Food is above average.  You'll find diverse selection of food and the presentation on their desserts were quite good (like in Bellagio and Wynn).  That night I asked if they have any lamb and the gentleman told me they ran out. Food was good but nothing really stood out.. . This year we came back again to give my in-laws (visiting from another county) a Vegas Buffet experience.  It turned out to be a real disaster... and here's how it all went down:. Thanksgiving weekend pricing... $60 for Total Rewards members & $64 for regular price.  If you want to be in front of the line, you can pay an extra $20 for each person.  We asked the lady at the podium and she told us to check-in through a computer kiosk in front to give us the time to come back.  Estimated wait time is 134 minutes and our check-in time was at 5:18 PM.  According to our ticket, we needed to return and check back in at 7:27 PM.  I even left my cell number to get notified on our return time.  More than 2 hours of waiting time... so instead of keeping your money in your pocket, this is their subtle way of luring you in to playing on the casino floor and spending more money.  Then we came back around 7:00 PM and there was a huge line (BTW I DID NOT even get a text message  reminder for our return time).  We were told that we have to stand in line and wait for another 1 hour and 30 mins.  That is just ridiculous!  Of course we ended up eating at a different place.  I just hope that the line is not like this everyday. On a lighter note, there's this one lady who I think is a Diamond or a 7 Stars member who was going around the line of people and telling everyone that she can take anyone to the front of the line as long as they pay her cash LOL.  Talk about making some dough in the casino to sustain their gambling addiction LMAO!. . Ratings:. 1 star for service (the way they handled the waiting time and lines). 3 stars for the food (last year). . Happy eating folks!
Note that I rarely give 5 stars.. . This buffet is more than amazing. The whole process from getting seated to the speed of table attention is impeccably efficient. More importantly, the food is extraordinary and the presentation (very important) is welcoming and appetizing. The cleanliness and flow of people is streamlined and it seems that management has thought of everything.. . I like the hot plate holder devices--you'll see what I mean. They give you 2 of them when you walk in and you're not sure what they are initially.. . The seafood area is amazing--stations always full and all the pieces look big/succulent. You can get your crab legs steamed by the employees behind the station and the butter dispenser at the end of the station looks dangerously good. The carved meats looked and tasted amazing. Every dish they presented on their counters made you want to try every little thing. Hopefully you have evolved to have more than 1 stomach. Moreover, service was fast/excellent--easy to drop that good tip at the end.. . It's basically $50/person. Worth it? 100%. This is hands-down the best Las Vegas buffet in the world. Yes, the most best Las Vegas buffet in the entire world.
This is the second time I've been to this place and dude, this place is beyond amazing. I woke up around 9:30 on the day after Christmas and headed to this restaurant to check out the line. There was no line!!!! My family n I got charged ($43.99 for holiday brunch) and seated 15 mins later and hands down to the best buffet in Vegas. They have great selections from breakfast, brunch and to seafood! The desert booth captured my heart with fresh crepes and other kind of sweets. Can't wait to come back the next time I visit Vegas!
The service, it's like omg, I checked in at 4:24 and the ticket said we can come back at 8:20, then I asked the server if we can just leave and come back, she said of course we can, so me and my girlfriend left to shop and came back at 8:30, I asked the server where do we check in, she said we have get wait in line which we take another two hours she said, what the fuck is the point of letting customers getting the ticket? Even the Canadian old couple was forced to get back in line, and same as many other people, sincerely, Cesar needs to change the procedure.
Waited 6 hours. Never got the text. Came in at 9:50pm. Said computer system doesn't work and too bad and you have one-half hour to eat. Horrible and what a waste of time.
This is one of the better buffets in Vegas.  The foods are better quality.   My favorite thing to eat here are the oysters and crab legs.  They have really fresh oysters and I like to dip it in the jabenero salsa from their salsa bar.  I also liked that they served their crab legs cold or hot.  Also if you are a meat eater, this buffet offers great selections lambs,  prime ribs and etc.  The only bad thing that I have to say is that if you are not a platinum reward members then the wait is really long.  Also be prepared to spend some money cause the price is pretty high for a Vegas buffet.
The food may be great but the service is the absolute worst. Don't know if it was because I went during the holiday season or not but I have never dealt with such an unprofessional business/management. . . The food is delicious but for the wait, price, and customer service combined is not worth the experience. The customer service itself is shit and do not expect to eat for at least 3+ hours with rude workers and irrational policies. . . Their 'policy' of the whole party having to be there in the entire duration of 3-4 hours of the line is bullshit.. . I came here once with a party of 4 about a year ago during the summer and the food was great but the wait was.. insanely long and not worth it.. . The second time I came with a party of 11, called twice to the front desk of Caesar's Palace AND got directed to the front desk of the Bacchanal Buffet to make sure that the whole party did not have to be there, and they both confirmed that it is completely fine.. After waiting in the line for 1+ hours, the so called manager named Melissa comes up to us and rudely says that we may not stand in the line unless our whole party is here. . Even after arguing with her, and questioning the existence of the policy, she rudely interrupted us every time to say there was nothing she could do about it. She was extremely rude and did not know how to apologize. . Asked if I could talk to the head manager, she rudely cuts me off and claims that she IS the manager in a derogatory tone.. . Not only is this place not worth the wait, but it is also not worth losing your sanity.
Heard all about Caesars buffet and thought we'd give it a try for the first time and upgraded our buffet of buffet passes.  Wife and I made a beeline straight for the seafood and crab legs.  Steamed crab legs too!. . A little over an hour later and at risk of having to be carted off like award-winning oversized pumpkins, it's easy to see why this place gets rave reviews.  Friendly staff, fresh and often replenished food.  And did I mention the crab legs?  They also have gelato and an overall amazing dessert area.
There's not much else I can add or say that hasn't been said.. . I went to Vegas for 4 days, and paid $50 twice to go to this place - that's how good it is. It has gourmet food for EVERYONE - vegetarians and others alike.. . Don't bother with soda pop - get their fruit juices that are on the buffet line near the meat station. . . You will marvel at how amazing this place is. Quite simply, the greatest food I have *EVER* eaten, and the greatest dining experience ever - bar none.
Extreme long wait but you can pay extra $25 to cut in line. Else u need to get a number then come back at a given time and LINE UP for another 45 more minutes to pay and get in.  No kidding. . Food was good but for some $50 was expensive.  I heard its the number 1 buffet in Vegas so at least i gave it a try.
This is probably one of the best buffets I have ever been to. It has a large variety of different dishes from different cuisines. It is quite pricey but the best time to come in is around 2:30pm and pay for the lunch price. I love how they display their dishes and plate each individual portions of food. If you are a seafood lover, make sure to stack your plate up with the steam crab legs! I wish I wasn't so full that I didn't get to try the prime rib but there will be next time! Definitely go on an empty stomach because you would want to try everything!
Too high of a price and wait. We came here for Christmas dinner. $190 for two people with express passes and we still has to wait about half an hour. With no express passes? The wait would be 644 minutes. I'm not exaggerating. They have a machine that calculates the wait time. The good part is that once you're inside, it's not crazy in there. The selection looks decent in appearance but when you taste it, you'll feel like it's a bit subpar. . . Nothing stands out here. The only two things I really liked was the lamb and suprisingly, the egg tart dessert. All else was just meh and I tried everything.. . People love this buffet but here's some hard advice that is just plain true. Unless you just want to stuff your fat face, just go somewhere else nice, you'll spend less or equal money for better quality food. If you must eat at a buffet, I actually liked the Village Seafood buffet in Rio much better.
Hands down the very best buffet ever.  We've been several times but this time i had the mussels which were so tender and perfectly cooked and sauced. The smoked salmon was great, the bacon crispy,  the steak tender, the veggies flavorful, the seafood and fruit actually fresh, the Chinese food really authentic!   So much food you can actually imagine you are at a Roman feast and you probably could stay and keep eating for 24 hours and not repeat a dish (if you got a new dish every 10 min). Wow, what decadence! My favorite was the little fried donuts (today they had it with bananas and syrup ) which i have never had so incredibly light crispy on the outside.  Unique dishes to please the jaded but with a healthy dose of your standard fare cooked well to please everyone else.  Those little silicone finger mitts they give you?  It is to reach for those hot small dishes.
I'll be honest. This was my FAVORITE buffet up until this past weekend. We got ready EXTRA early and got there at 10AM to our early check-in receipt from the machine. Our ticket said: APPROXIMATE CHECK IN TIME WILL BE 11:05AM and that we'd get a text a few minutes before... We never got a text and when we went up to the line, they made us stand in line ANYWAY. WHAT IS THE POINT OF THEM HAVING THAT DUMB MACHINE THERE IF WE HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE?? THEY SHOULD HAVE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS saying EVEN IF YOU HAVE THIS TICKET YOU STILL HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE.  Our group was trying to be understanding and saying well it IS Christmas and they're extremely busy. THAT wasn't the part that pissed us off. We waited over 2 hours IN LINE (NOT counting the 1 hour we spent near by waiting for our TEXT that we never GOT) and when we got to the front of the line, we stopped moving up for over 30 minutes because they started letting this OTHER line ahead of us. I guess these people were the 7-star guests, or guests that paid extra. WHY WOULDNT YOU JUST DO A SEPARATE ENTRANCE FOR THESE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF SHOVING THEM IN FRONT OF US WHILE WE STAND THERE WATCHING THIS HAPPEN?? IS THAT YOUR WAY OF ADVERTISING - IF YOU WANT TO GET IN, THEN PAY EXTRA PER PERSON? ALSO there were some guests that started complaining and screaming so THEY were ALSO shoved in front of us. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT... PATIENT guests like US get punished and stuck in line, while SCREAMING guests get put in front of the line... WHAT AN AWESOME management system  you got there. We got so fed up and left to eat at Spago - which turned out to be better.  EVEN THOUGH this WAS my favorite buffet EVER, I probably won't go back since they have the worst management/customer service ever. I just felt bad because I was the only one that has been to this buffet out of our group and the whole trip, I hyped this place up SO much til we got there. In the end, my family never got to try this place and everyone left angry.
Understandably there is a wait for Christmas week but to have an "express" check-in service to wait in line 2 hours (and we still didn't get in) was crazy. We arrived at 10:45am and I checked in and the express ticket showed 11:08 am. I was happy until I found out we had to wait in another line. Still not mad but understood the wait would be long. After over an hour and a half wait to be told we need to wait another hour was ridiculous. And to see another line just keep being let in when I'm the the damn express line is crazy. This place is horribly managed and its sad because I heard so many good things. The person in front of me had a verbal brawl with the cashier and was barley let in cause he threw a couple f bombs. I mean is that how to get into this buffet? It's sad because I had such high hopes and this was supposed to be the highlight meal of the trip. This is not the way to treat paying hotel guests. We were next in line at the cashier after over 2 hours and still another hour wait (looked like 2 hours) because one line kept being let ahead of us for over an hour. No food is worth that. We walked over to another better managed restaurant and met some great locals and unexpectedly had a great meal. Maybe I'll try this place on a Monday morning after a big weekend and campout the night before for an express ticket to be told I'm next in line only to eat on Friday dinner.
place is still very busy!! arrive early for dinner. . unfortunately from my recent vist some of the food quality has declined MAINLY the MEAT section the lamb chops tasted like shit the ribs tasted like salt on a bone!!! WTF everything else was good as i remembered but whats going on at that section!?!?. . they need to fire whoever is preparing/cooking that meat, im more angry that they are making meat that taste like crap and its being thrown out cause its not edible!!!!. . and they need more people clearing tables still slow and nearly non existent!. . still my go to buffet in LV doh.
Totally stuffed myself silly.... Do come during off season, otherwise you might get 8 hour wait.... . Lines were crazy, and we lucked out with just 2 hour wait after we got our reservation time.. . First meal of the day, so I cleaned my plate on my first round and ate too fast that I had hard time after the meal so don't forget to pace yourself.. . Everything on the Asian food area was on point. . Minus the pho bar... need improvement on the noodle consistency and offering sauces to make it spicy.. . Seafood was delicious with hot crab legs, shrimp cocktails, and stone crabs.. I didn't bother too much with the meats, but from my friend's reaction, it was a bit dry, which is usually the case at buffets.. . Dessert bar was awesome, so make sure you leave room!  One more tip, make sure you use your total rewards card to get a discount per person on the buffet cost.
The reviews are on point in describing this buffet as one of the most exquisite on quality dishes, fresh ingredients, and overall great taste. My overall dissatisfaction was in how disrespected we were by the staff who would not empathize with us and other families with children. After 90 minutes we were repeatedly told we had a two hour limit. We explained that our 8 month old had to be changed and nursed during the meal and still, were harassed by one of the leads. My wife was not allowed to finish her dessert after spending one hour addressing the needs of our little ones. We are very upset given the advanced planning we made to get a reasonably dine time at the kiosk. The staff need greater training and might need a protocol to asses each family's circumstances prior to harassing guests. We felt discriminated, rushed, ridiculed by staff who stared and spoke about us from a short distance. Sadly this was also my birthday dinner.
Heard a lot of good things about this Caesar's Palace gem and decided to give it a go.  I came at 10:45am with my family on a Sunday.  We had to wait like 15-20 minutes, which was a lot less than I had expected.  There's a line further in dedicated to groups with parties 6 or more.  Our party of 7 was the third group in that line.  I felt bad for the snake like line that we bypassed.  If ever that's the case, I'd totally ask another group in line if they'd want to join groups. Whatever gets you in faster right? :D. . Since we went on Dec. 28, it was holiday pricing.  It costed $47 vs. the usual $42.  Service was awesome!  My mimosa glass was never empty for too long and our waitress was really sweet.  She didn't even complain when I wanted a different drink each time.  Their hot chocolate is amazing by the way and it comes with whipped cream (:. . The food was amazing!  They had a huge variety and the presentation of everything was immaculate!  Totally worth your money!  I actually enjoyed the cha siu ramen and pho.  Some buffets make asian soups too salty, but they made it alright here.  Here are a few of the things I had tried (don't judge how big of a fatty I am haha): Mussels, Crab Legs, Oysters, Shrimp Cocktail, Breakfast Burrito, Mac n Cheese, Red Velvet Pancakes, and Chicken & Waffles with Sweet Potato Fries, etc. Seafood was fresh and I loved almost everything I tried.  Dessert was awesome with the made to order crepe station and the gelato station.  I appreciate the scoops of the gelato are small, so that you can try a bunch of them haha.  I can rave on and on and I really enjoyed my experience. Definitely stop by if you're in the area (:
If you're going to do a buffet, you might as well do the best one there is in town. Bacchanal is the best, but it comes with a pretty hefty price tag and a usually long wait in line.. . All the stations are decent and I end up roaming around from food area to good area for far too long trying to narrow down my choices. I like to think of it as a little exercise before filling up on crab legs, steak and gelato.. . Be sure you factor in wait times before coming here. Obviously they are usually busier during weekends and holidays.
Are there negative stars? No? Well apparently I have to give 1 according to Yelp. Fine, but I'll have you know my experience today at Bacchanal's brunch charade was horrendous. I'll keep it simple by listing my complaints in bullet form so that you, Bacchanal, can try to improve from the below sea level rank I experienced today:. 1: at the door, no it wasn't a door, it was a bizarre self check in counter type thing. But I was really checking myself into a black hole you call your restaurant. Have you everheard of reservations? Or maybe a numbering system that even my deli was able to figure out. . 2: if I totaled the amount of time I got my ticket and waited in line, it was 3.5 hours. Do you know what could happen in 3.5 hours? I could've watched an entire football game or taken a plane to Dallas with some time to spare. Anyway, we were corralled in these never ending ropes like cattle. . 3: the line got out of hand so we all started arguing where everyone was and the people with platinum passes who only had to wait 30 min got in before me. If someone has platinum passes, they should have a separate line or if they are in a party of 6 or more they should've been put into the 6+ line on the other side of the restaurant. Everyone was in the same line! The fault all started at the beginning and it got worse. The greeter didn't know how to handle the crowd. The organization was garbage. . 4: the food was cold, the lines were long, and your food was sub par.. . Guys though, I'll be nice. I'm not a mean person. I'll compliment you in some way so you won't be entirely depressed:. 1: nice efficient service staff! Our waitress was very sweet.. 2: good food variety. . . I'm sorry Bacchanal, but rot in your grave, because I hope no one goes. You're dead to me.
I've been here so many times before for brunch and I never fully enjoyed it to it's extent but that all changed when when I went for dinner this past Monday night!. Maybe it's because I've always been drunk or super hungover so I cant ever really stomach buffet food but I was sober this time and it was soooo gooooooood!!. . My boyfriends a Diamond status for Total Rewards so we got to skip the entire line & got seated right away which was definitely a PLUS because the line here is always SUPER long.. like 2+ hours wait long.. . In my opinion, buffets are ALWAYS better for dinner than brunch.  I don't want no scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage when I'm at a buffet... I want the GOOD STUFF. and thats exactly what I got when I went ;). . $108 for 2 people for dinner.. $80-$90 for 2 people for brunch on a weekend? that includes unlimited mimosas.. If you're a Total Rewards member, use those points for a free meal! (;. . In the mood for some Chinese? Sushi? Pho? Prime rib? Mexican? Seafood? This place has it all! . . I consumed a lot of seafood here--salmon, tuna, & red snapper nigiri, sushi rolls, fresh oysters, crab legs, clams & mussels.  The quality of seafood is always a hit or a miss at buffets in my opinion, but the quality here was well worth the money.  . Oysters were very fresh with no fishy smell/taste, the crab legs had decent amount of meat to them & the nigiri was fresh as well.  . . I also finally got to try the juices that come in cute little bottles.   I tried the Guava, Mango & Horchata. Mango was really good and I also liked the Horchata but I found it a bit too sweet for my taste.. . Nothing much to complain about here except I would stay away from the hot & sour soup and the prime rib as I found both of them to be extremely salty and unsatisfying.. . NOW FOR THE DESSERTS!. Loved:. +Chocolate covered strawberries--the chocolate one was sweet & salty.  . +CREME BRULEE--such perfection.. +Italian Cookie Gelato is probably the best flavor they offer.. +Macarons are soft and sweet. Was not a big fan of the flavors they offer but they were still good.  I mean, what other buffet offers macarons at their dessert bar?!. . BASICALLY, if you're in Vegas, got time to kill & super starving. COME HERE.. Truly the best buffet in Vegas, hands down.
Until recently I cannot even remember the last time I had gone to a Las Vegas buffet.  We chose Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace because at the time, it had great Yelp reviews and simply a reputation as being "the best" buffet in Vegas.  At over $60 per person, my expectations were pretty high. . . When we got to Bacchanal there was a huge line and we were told there would be a 3 hour wait!  I believe you may be able to put your name down  and walk around until your name is called.  However, there was no way I was going to hang out and wait at Caesar's for a few hours, especially when my family and I were starving.  I don't think I would wait 3 hours for any restaurant.  Turns out, we were able to get in right away since my mother-in-law is disabled and has problems standing.  Props for the manager for being so gracious about that. . . What surprised me most about Bacchanal was the atmosphere.  Because of it's reputation and price I was expecting something a bit more elegant.  A buffet though, is still a buffet, no matter how much you try to dress it up.  The large rooms with diners getting up and down and walking around to get food still reminded me of a school cafeteria.  . . The food is divided into stations from several nationalities:  Asian, Mexican, Italian, plus "American" (prime rib, Kobe sliders, fried foods, etc.), a seafood station. And of course the required dessert station.  . . My love of Asian food and Seafood prompted me to concentrate on the Asian station (sushi rolls, various Chinese dishes) and Seafood (crab legs, clams casino, crayfish).  Nothing was bad, but honestly, nothing stood out either.  Things I would not recommend:  the tacos (made with homemade tortillas) and the Kobe sliders (hard as a rock with no flavor).  There was a huge array of desserts. I sampled a few but I could not really point out anything that was truly scrumptious for me. I did not even really care for the gelato served.  . . Perhaps compared to other Vegas buffets this is first in class. I would prefer. spending a comparable amount of money on a restaurant that specializes in one type of cuisine and does it well.  I would also feel more comfortable dining in a bit of a more intimate setting, instead of the large cavernous rooms at Bacchanal. . . .
5+ stars for the food. 1 star for the 2+ hour long wait.  The time given to you on the ticket doesn't mean much.  It appears as long as you have a ticket you can stand in line.   The best crab legs at any buffet I have ever eaten.  Get the boiled crab legs at the station inside by the pizza and salad bar.  Tastes much better than the cold ones on ice (but the cold ones are pretty good too).  Sushi is above average but not great.  Prime rib (given medium rare unless you ask for well done) and lamb chops are great.  LInes at all food stations move fast (It's just the line to get in that takes forever).  Although $56/person for dinner (get the TR card), I think it is well worth it.  Fabulous dessert station so save some room.
