Super disappointed. The "huge" nachos literally only had toppings on the  very top. Half down it was plain chips !?! Barely enough to share for two people unless you like eating plain chips. BUT the margaritas were great! That's it!
Good food and good entertainment.  Food is good and plentiful.  Where the Key West Margaritaville lacks in flare this place has it.
Having been to many Margaritaville's in my lifetime, I knew that walking into the Las Vegas one would not disappoint. We ordered a margarita sampler which was AMAZING. It had been a while since we had tequila, much less margaritas so it definitely brought back some memories. They had several little shows going on while we were there including stilt walkers, hula girls and fun dancers. This would be a great place to take a group!
My sister and I went here for dinner for convenience, as we were staying at the Flamingo. Reliable menu, nothing too fancy or expensive, entrees average $25. I had the sangria,  very good helped me relax after a long day of traveling. We had nachos and beers. Friendly staff.
I love Margarita drinks and this was across the street from our hotel so we had to try it.. . We didn't eat all day and drove 6 hours to Vegas. We checked into our Hotel Caesars  and was starved. I head about this place in a Las Vegas review website so we decided to try it out.. . Oh my god! This place is alive with energy it was huge. We sat near the bar and a very friendly waiter came over and took our order.. I order what was one of the most amazing margs I've ever had! I believe it was called the Perfect margarita. The name fit it well!. . We ordered two Cheddar BBQ burgers and they were awesome!. People were ordering the Nachos and we wish we knew about them before. They looked like a mountain of nachos!. . The experience was so good we came back late the next night. They had a band playing and they were great!. They had a limited menu when we came back and we ordered the wings and a shrimp appetizer.. The Wings were plump and crunchy just like we like them and the shrimp was perfect.. . This place deserves 6 stars! We will be back in April!
We go to Margaritaville numerous times a year and have a great time.  We take visitors to it.  Last night was not as great as usual.  The Host staff was having a bad day and did not want to be at work.  We had 7 in the group and it took 40 minutes to get seated at 2 round tables.  They seat several groups of 5 & 6  before us (they came in after us)  They could have seated us right away if they planned to give us 2 tables.  We could not talk with the other table and it made it tough to share nachos.  Food was great and Jeff our server was awesome!  He made up fro the poor host staff. . Not sure I will take friends to Margaritaville for a while.  We would have stayed longer and spent more but we went somewhere else so we could seat together.
Perfect place to go when in Vegas.  Great food and a good price.  The nachos would feed two football offensive linemen.  Easy to order one dish to feed two because of large portion size.  Great atmosphere and good food.  Of course the margaritas are the bomb!!!
