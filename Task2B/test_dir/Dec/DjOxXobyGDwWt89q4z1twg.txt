I'm not a big fan of Monta, maybe it's because I get sick every time I come here and eat something with the charsui (which I figured out after I was about to give up). Everyone else claims it's the best ramen in Las Vegas, maybe, but I haven't been to enough places around to say for certain just yet. So far it's a no for me, because of the way I get sick.. . . Growing up in Japan with a Chinese family, I know what good ramen tastes like and they're decent but when they're busy thenoodles are hard (not cooked long enough) which I hate, they have to be consistant! And on top of that I can't eat the charsui without getting sick which then it's game over for me for the day, so it usually ends with me giving it away to someone. . . So like I said, when it's busy they're not that consistant because they're trying to keep up with the demand and not be slow, but it shows in their cooking. I always get gyoza with my ramen and would feel weird if I didn't! Something I've done since I was a little child, besides the pair together taste great! . . The soup base itself is light as it should be, though sometimes I feel it's a bit salty (maybe my Asian taste buds were a little too active then, but it's good. Also depends on the one you want, I'm pretty traditional and don't stray from the shoyu (soy sauce base). The noodles is a hit and miss, since they're usually busy and rarely not, though I like going when most people aren't eating, the noodle can be either perfect or too hard for me. People like their noodles differently and not many places give you an option (very few in Japan do), but like I said hit and miss usually it's okay. . . Outside of their regular toppings you can add extra stuff like corn, butter, green onions, etc for some extra costs which isn't much at all! They also have kaedame which is a second helping of noodles, but you need to leave some soup base and not drink it if you're going to do that.. . Overall the price for what you get is decent and not too bad especially comparing it to places in Japan. My only complaint is that the charsui gets me sick every time I've eaten it and since I've stopped it's been okay.
Best among ramen places in LV & more reasonable price. Place is really small and there's wait most of the time. Still, we keep on coming back. . Service is fast & efficient. Servers are courteous. Place is clean.  . Reminds me of Ramen places I've visited in Japan. :)
Monta Ramen's tonkatsu ramen broth is one of the best ramen broths we have tried. You can really taste the flavor in every sip. The chasu melts in your mouth and the price is very reasonable compared to other ramen places.
Our last day in Las Vegas, We decided to go to Monta Ramen for lunch. Monta opened at  11:30am, and there is a line already!! We saw people lining up outside, after waiting for a little bit, my friend noticed there is a sign up sheet inside!!! Damn it!! They should leave the sign up outside! Oh, there is no sign saying Manto in front, but you can't miss it with the long line outside.. . Anyways, after about almost 1 hour wait, we finally got seated at the bar ... which was fine, we get to look at the chefs.. . Food! We ordered a Large Pork Belly Rice Bowl to share - the fatty pieces of pork were cooked perfectly, so tender, buttery, just goes perfect with rice! I really miss this!. . Hubby ordered the basic Tonkotsu Ramen with egg added - broth is very bold and tense, and what I love the most is not overly salty!. . I ordered the Kuro Ramen with egg added on the daily special board - black garlic oil ramen, I really love it. Egg was perfectly soft boiled, runny center. I do wish that it was thick noodles, this is just personal preference :). . My friend ordered Tonkotsu Ramen with egg and corn added - looks amazing!!. . Very good and authentic Ramen place!
This ramen place could do well in the LA area. I had the miso ramen spicy and the flavor was on point. The charsu was delicious and basically melts in your mouth Very quick service of course and a great feel to the restaurant. Definitely will stop in again when I'm in town.
Read all the hype on this place and finally went to see what it was all about. Glad I did. Got there early and there was already a line building up. The line eventually got crazy. But the ramen here was fantastic! I've had ramen all over the world but this was one of the BEST ever. I realize waiting in line sucks but this place was worth the wait. I tried the black garlic oil Kuro ramen and it was hands down the best bowl of ramen I ever had. We also tried the spicy tonkotsu ramen and it had great flavor as well. Best to get here 30 mins early and just wait before the linebecomes crazy but you will be glad you did.
Ramen here is reasonably price and the miso ramen is delicious! Definitely going to in here next time I'm in Las Vegas!
I came to this place because I was referred and love a good ramen place. It's a small place. Be prepared to wait but it's well worth the wait! The food was delicious! From the appetizers to their entree.  This is a true Japanese ramen place. I will be definitely coming back.
Although the dining area is small, it is well worth the wait! I've been here several times and I always try to bring a different friend. The flavors of all of their dishes are spot on and the soups are an explosion of yumminess in and around your mouth. I'm forever a fan!
Best ramen house in Vegas hands down. Love the miso Ramen with extra butter chasu and diced green onions! And I'm addicted to the garlic and chili oil as well :) if you want to leave full and satisfied without killing your wallet this is the place to go.
This ramen place is pretty popular in Vegas so I thought i would check it out. . . The place is pretty small, so the wait was a little long. But when we were finally able to order I got the spicy tonkatsu ramen with an added egg and seaweed. . . The soup was a little buttery and heavy for my taste, but still not bad.
Monta Ramen is one of the best ramen spots in Las Vegas. Is it the best in town? Maybe.... . My order I always get is the Tonkotsu Ramen + extra Chashu + Nitamago + Corn. . Sometimes I order Gyoza, sometimes Fried Rice, sometimes both. Depends on how hungry I am.. . Everything is done well and if you need more heat just add chili powder.. . What sets Monta apart from the rest is their Chashu. I don't really fuck with pork but their Chashu just melts with good buttery & rich flavor. The broth can get heavy but their must be an egg in every Japanese hot noodle dish.. . The spot is like how a ramen spot should be. Limited spacing with more seats at the bar than tables. You get in and get out (if no wait time) in 30 mins.... . When it comes to Japanese food I'm a harsh critic because the times I've been to Tokyo and my mom's cooking. . Overall it's maybe the best in town as I've converted non ramen lovers into lovers of ramen...if you haven't been go for sure!
Best ramen I've ever had! Fresh ramen noodles are SO GOOD! This place is really delicious. It's become really popular so there will often be a wait but it usually doesn't take long because the food comes out really fast. I especially love the tonkotsu broth.
Great ramen. Quick Service. It's perfect for a chilly night and no hassle dinner. Make sure you sign yourself in right when you get there. Our wait was only about five minutes and the good was well worth it from the kim chi fiend rice to the shoyu ramen. Highly recommended
I like  the ease of the menu, which makes ordering so much easier. Overall, tasty ramen but I found that the broth was a bit more salty than I would have liked. Not so bad that I couldn't eat it but it would have been better with a little less miso. Service was very quick and servers were friendly. I ordered my ramen "spicy" for a dollar extra but they offer sriaracha and chili oil on the side. Next time, I'd rather give them that dollar as a tip and spice my own ramen. One other bummer is that they do not have hot tea. All in all, I'd come back but i'm not jumping all over myself to do so.
This place is really good! The prices aren't bad at all and totally worth it (quality and quantity wise). I heard that this place can get really busy and all tables/seats were occupied from when we got there till the time we left. Luckily we just beat the rush and only waited about 5-10 mins. I would definitely hit this place up the next time I'm in Vegas!
This place is extremely satisfying, especially after a day of hiking. We were able to split a pork belly bowl and potstickers between 3 people. The pork belly was soft but not chewy and very flavorful and the shoyu flavor did not overpower the pork. We added goma to the bowl which gave the pork and rice a rosted, nutty flavor. The potsickers were delicious. The wrapper was thin and crispy and the filling had a slight kick to it, so if you don't enjoy spicy food in anyway I wouldn't recommend ordering these. I ordered the tonkatsu shoyu ramen with an egg and was very satisfied with my choice. The broth was creamy without being too fatty and the chashu pork was soft and melted in my mouth. The egg could have used more seasoning or marinated a bit longer as it was rather flavorless.  The noodles were the right consistency and were neither too chewy or starchy. The service was on par with the food. The wait staff was friendly and came back to check on us often.
There's always a line and it's a small restaurant but it's worth the wait.. If you aren't Asian then you probably aren't used to a pork based broth, then that's what you should try. The sliced pork (Tonkotsu) is amazing.. I go back every time I am in Vegas, TRY IT!!
This place is AMAZING! Be prepared for a long wait if you come during peak hours because it's a small restaurant. We ordered Shoyu Ramen, Miso Ramen, Pork Bellly Bowl and Chashu bowl, and kimchi. My favorite was the Pork Belly bowl (~$3 for small, ~$6 for regular size), the ramen bowls were fine but they weren't the best I've had in Vegas.
This didn't turn out to be what i expected. Soup base was so salty, and the meat melted in the soup. I couldn't taste the meat at all. All in all...mehhhhhh
This place is definitely worth checking out. The tonkotsu ramen had delicious broth and the chashu pork in it was amazing! The wait to get in was a bit long, however totally worth it! Once we were in the staff was friendly, service was quick and efficient! We will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas!
Soup is a little too salty. Noodles are among the best ones in U.S. Eggs are so-so. There are too less seats in this restaurant. I waited for about 1 hour to gets seat. And when I left it, when was 3pm, there were still a crowd of people waiting in the line.
This place was a great place to eat! The shoyu ramen was awesome. The miso was pretty tasty too if you like miso. Fried rice was reAlly good also! Even thought the line was long and a ton of people it was worth the wait. For anyone who is familiar to orenchi in San Jose. It's kind of like that just a little smaller. A place I will be back to when we are in town!!
It's like 3.75 stars.. Not a huge fan of ramen, unless it's remakarable place and though it was good, it wasn't anything I would want to stay in line waiting for it.. It was just not comparable to ramen places in LA or NY.
Unfortunately, a place I used to think was near 5 stars and a reference standard for ramen in the US, was entirely disappointing today - quite embarrassing actually. For some reason, the soup was bland, extremely salty and not hot, the noodles seemed so so, the bamboo shoots were coarse, and the pork slices were extremely fatty. This extreme inconsistency from prior experiences leaves me wondering whether to ever bring guests to this place ever again. Perhaps there has been a change in chef?
Hands down. Best. Ramen. Ever! I came here on a weekday for lunch. Actually, the reason why I even decided to check this place out is because the day before I was at the Japanese Curry spot just a couple hundred feet away (in the same plaza) and noticed a long line at Monta Ramen. I was curious. Why were so many people waiting outside to eat ramen? Well, I needed to found out! So the very next day, my friend and I arrived around 11:15am (the place opens at 11:30am for lunch). There were already a few people in line waiting for the doors to open. I peeked inside. It's very small! There's only about 6 tables and a few seats at the bar. We got seated at 11:30am and when I looked out the window, there was already a line. . . We ordered their top two special daily ramens: Spicy Tonkatsu and Black garlic Oil Kuro ramen. Both are fantastic! Very flavorful and unique! I've never tasted anything like the Kuro ramen before. Truthfully it looks gross cuz it's black and oil, but damn the ramen tastes soooo ono (good)!!!! The noodles are perfectly cooked, al dente! The service is fast and friendly (they kind of want you out of there quick, though! lol). . . If you're ever in Vegas and you love ramen, you def have to check out Monta Ramen. You won't regret it! The long line is worth the wait.
