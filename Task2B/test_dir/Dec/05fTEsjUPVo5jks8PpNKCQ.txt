Brisket was amazing, ordered the party pack got some of everything and it was all really good, then the ribs came. The baby back ribs were great. Thanks for the great service also.
This is one of the, nope, the best bbq joint ever. We had the outlaw burger which was sick, perfect blend of taste and crunch from the onions. No need to request medium rare as the burgers smoked to perfection. The biggin dads favorite had a mix of 3 meats that taste like they were bred in the same farm. I cant say how happy we are with the food and service. The hot sauce made my buddy tear up, tasty stuff. I feel like I can make a mess of myself,  wear a bib made of paper napkins and feel proud doing it. Free refills on the drinks and quality friendly staff make this place a obvious no 1 choice for bbq. Gordon ramsey abd his 20dollar burger can rot compared to a gem like this. one of the best burgers I ever tasted. The staff is so wholesome and authentically country with the way they carry themselves and the food, by mere presence they made me think they are co owners with the pride they have for their food. I didnt detect any of the fake kindness you often see at regular food joints. The owners should be proud of themselves and their staff.
Wow! Surprisingly really good BBQ. We didn't know what to expect since the street getting to this establishment looked a little shady. We parked in the lot and walked in. Yup, I can deal with this. No ghetto-ness here! There is a large board with the menu and there is also menus provided by the staff.. . You walk up and place your order. We ordered a smoking plate of the pork bbq ribs, bread and the mac n cheese combo and the fiancee ordered a smoked brisket sandwich. We also ordered the blueberry cobbler a la mode.. . The ribs were really good. I like my ribs with a lot of sauce so luckily there was a bottle of sauce on each table. There are 2 dining areas with TVs, as well as outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is pretty much used for smokers. . . The staff is really courteous, friendly and informative. If you're new to the restaurant, they are very helpful in making your decision. We did notice a lot of first timers.. . The only issue we had, was that our food came out lukewarm. Not sure if the food was sitting out for a few minutes before serving to us, but it would have been tastier if the food was hot upon arrival.. . Definitely recommend this place for those looking for a quick good meal off the strip. We had no wait, but after we placed our order, there was a line out the door. A lot of people ended up taking their food to-go, so that's a good thing if you plan to eat inside the restaurant.
On vacation for a few days. I went there the first night I arrived, and then the next night, and the next. you get the idea. The first night I had the pulled piggy. It was awesome sauce and I ate it too fast so then I ordered the chicken nacho fries. Put me to sleep. While I had the fries someone else ordered the Outlaw burger, at that moment I knew I was coming back. The next day I had the Outlaw Burger and the 3rd day I went with the all you can eat. And with a free dessert with the Yelp check in..Child Please!
wow...ive always relied on yelp to give me an honest evaluation of a new restaurant....the reviews for this place were very good...so I went out of my way to go and eat there....if your into bland tasting barbeque...bad waffle fries and eating on picnic tables..by all means go for it at rolling whatever...just a joke to call this a 4 star plus barbeque place....give me a break.
My boyfriend and I came here after we saw this place on the Travel Channel. I was very skeptical because its Las Vegas and its barbecue and those two words do not usually go in the same sentence, boy was I wrong. The food was amazing. I had the smoked meatloaf topped with fried onion strings, on top of a bed of pillowy soft mashed potatoes. My boyfriend had a plate of protein ( I forgot the actual name, but the plate came with beef brisket, chicken, ribs and waffle fries). The brisket was okay, but the chicken was fantastic and I do not really care for ribs. I would definitely come back.
let me start by saying that there isnt really any bbq places that ive tried here in vegas. But rollin smoke is something else.  this place is awesome.  ive had the outlaw burger and it was great i give it a 9.  ive had the trio plate. which consists of 3 meats of your choice a side a roll and a drink.  i ordered the pulled pork,  brisket, and ribs.  with a side of mac n cheese. the meats were juicy amd tender great with. their house bbq sauce.  this place is a go to if you are looking for great bbq at good prices.
As far as BBQ goes, Rollin Smoke is decent.  The menu is quite large and there are a lot of interesting items to choose from, including waffle fry nachos.  The burger is pretty mediocre (though it claims to be the best), but the rest on the menu is pretty good. My biggest gripe is the price.  It's as much to eat here as it is at a nice sit down restaurant. For a small shack that serves BBQ at picnic tables, it's a bit pricey. It certainly isn't the best BBQ I've ever had.  That being said, good BBQ in Vegas is virtually non-existent, and Rollin Smoke's existence is appreciated.  It's definitely worth a visit to see if it's your style of BBQ.
This place is awesome. I've lived in vegas for 20 years and just found this. I wish I knew about it sooner.
I'm not sure how many 5-star reviews I give, but if I could give 6, Rollin Smoke Barbecue would get them.  We came early on a weekday, and before we had finished our meal there was a line out the door.  We sampled several items, including the pulled pork, cole slaw, banana pudding, and ribs.  All were wonderful, but the hot dog with absolutely everything and the kitchen sink piled on top was a winner.  I don't even like hot dogs that much, but this was among the best things I ate in 2014.  The restaurant is in a run down commercial neighborhood and your eating on benches (inside or out), but if you're a foodie, this is a must.
Awesome place. Found it thanks to yelp after checking out of our hotel on the strip. Perfect post-Vegas-debauchery food!. . Easy to find right off the 15, just a mile from the strip. Parked in front, was immediately greeted by Mike (the owner I think). Super nice guy, helped us choose our menu items and was genuinely appreciative that we came in. Love that.. . We sat ourselves at a picnic table and our food came out shortly. Hubs had a trio of sliders and they were huge! I had the pulled piggy sandwich. Portions were big and sides were super seasoned and greasy in a good way. Hangover cure! The brisket and chicken sliders were seriously amazing. Best I've had anywhere. The pulled pork was also very good. Super tender and no fat. . . We got a free hot peach cobbler a la mode for checking in on yelp. Heck yes!. . Our ONLY suggestion would be better buns and more sauce on the table. Overall, this place is great with amazing service. We'll be back next time we're in Vegas!
The outlaw burger is basically meatloaf on a bun but it has good flavor. It just didn't hold up that well when you try to eat it like a burger. The side of fries came out cold. This was the second time that my side item came out cold.
So let me start by saying this is a tough lil spot to find.  If you are not familiar with Las Vegas u will get lost.  There is usually a line to wait in to order your food from a guy sitting at a podium like a judge in court.  The prices are very high.  I ordered a half rack of St. Louis ribs, a half rack of Baby back ribs, Half pound of burnt ends, and a soda.  This came with two sides so i chose mac n cheese and coleslaw.  I paid $50.  WTF...?  . . The ribs were awesome but the burnt ends were almost all fat and not burnt.  The mac  n cheese was something like what u get at a bad diner.  Coleslaw...meh.  Soda was great.  lol. . I assume a probably wont be back as its a pain to get there and costly.  I can eat at other rib places and get more bang for my buck IMO.
The food is great the line was horrible but it's worth every wait and penny...This food so tastefully good I felt as if I was in heaven
Great food! I love BBQ and have to say it was the best. People need to come try this gem off the strip!
They still got it. We had a little of almost everything & it was all good - I think they changed their rub a little but still good. Hushpuppies a simple thing but not everyone can make them right but theirs are good . Again if you are in town & want real smoked Q it 's the place to go & check out the smoker they had turned into a fish tank it  is cool.
$24.99 All-U-Can-Eat...need I say more!? Tasty bbq and sides galore. Customer service to match their great eats. I love finding gems like RSBBQ - definitely need to be in the know to find this joint!
This is my new favorite BBQ place.  My mom ordered the beef ribs.  I made the mistake of tasting the beef ribs first. Not only did I not eat the two meats on my plate, I ordered a full rack.  I had the pleasure of meeting the "smoke master" and his quote, description of the beef ribs was perfect.  Just as tender as a filet.  . . The corn nuggets were excellent. Sweet tea was not too sweet.  I chatted with a couple who ordered the famous burger and the meatloaf.  The guy couldn't pick his favorite out of the two.  But the lady said the burger was a clear winner.  All I can say about the burger was this is the first time the real food looked better than the pictures.. . The interior is not very large but large enough.  Service was excellent.   . . Excellent job!
Delicious bbq. We got their gigantic bbq burger and the trip of meats. The corn fritters were a must, the Mac n cheese was okay. Comfy atmosphere and great good. Bread pudding portion was very small but tasty.
The food is to die for!! I'll definitely be back - the cornbread and mashed potatoes are amazzzing!!
I had to try this place out after hearing so many good things about it - and I got to say, it's lives up to the hype! Food is absolutely delicious and the service is great. I ordered the duo combo which comes with choice of two meats and a side. I got the brisket, hot links, and potato salad. Brisket was nice and juicy - hot links were savory - potato salad was very tasty with bacon pieces and pepper. To top it all off, I tried Blue Bell ice cream for the very first time and it was a great sweet finish to my meal. . . TIP: Don't go at 12 unless you have time to stay. First time I went, the line was out the door! I only had an hour lunch break so I came back a few days later after 1PM and had plenty of time.
friends have been telling me about this BBQ for over a year. I went tonight...it was the best I ever had, I will be back soon.
Updating on the baby back ribs which we didn't try last time.. Based on baby back ribs we've had most other places, these were not from baby piggies. These ribs come in at close to 3 pounds per rack! (two of us shared a rack and it was plenty... and we have big appetites) They are from huge HAWGS and are tender, delicious, loaded with meat, and did not have much residual fat.. They are cooked nearly perfectly to a slight dryness. Use their BBQ sauce if you like. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed their sauce... one of the best ever. . Next visit will be for their Brisket Dog and the Outlaw Burger. If you didn't read my first review, let me say again that the Bacon Potato Salad and Corn Nuggets are also very good.
I come from a family that treats bbq as a religion and this may be the best bbq I've ever had.  I've never written a Yelp review before this, but I feel it is my obligation to tell the worlds how delicious this food is.. . I came to Las Vegas to play poker and eat good food.  After eating dinner at this place late Saturday night, I am heartbroken that it's closed on Sunday because I was ready to head back the next day for lunch to have the $25 all-you-can eat (ANYTHING ON THE MENU!!!) feast.. . The ribs literally fell off the bone.  I cut the brisket with a plastic fork.  The bbq sauce was incredible.  Do yourself a favor and get the smoked meatloaf, which is served on a bed of some of the best mashed potatoes and is smothered in tasty onion strings.. . The staff was super friendly.  They were happy to tell me all about the food.  They all seemed to have a great deal of pride and respect for the food they served.. . Eat here.
Kickass bbq, it's off the beaten path but the q is worth the drive. I had the pit special and the ribs were awesome
Leave the Strip for this place, y'all. It's the real deal. Everything is delicious. The folks who run it are as genuine as they come. Don't let the fact that it's hidden underneath a freeway scare you away. Completely, 100% worth it.
The real deal!  Great ribs.  The beef and pork fall off the bone.  The sauce is added to the ribs just before serving.  You have to look in order to find this joint which is hidden away in an industrial area.  You need to go there!
The most amazing BBQ I have had my lips around. It's right on par with Franklen's BBQ in Texas. SOOOOO GOOOOD!
I was visiting Vegas and planning on driving here after looking at reviews.  But I pulled up the map on my GPS and found that it is around the corner from where I was staying at the Trump Hotel.  So we walked over, (which was a bit scary, due to industrial back side of the strip...). . Food was very good we had the 3 meat option.  I very much enjoyed the Pork, Ribs and Brisket.  This place also has a very good sauce.  It ranks better than anything in Utah, and you have to go to Texas to find something better.  The only reason I didn't say 5 was because of the Texas experiences I have had.
Best BBQ I've had in a long time. My date and I did the all you can eat and boy did we eat. I ordered their brisket plate and the brisket was cooked to perfection. I also ordered their brisket nachos and they were delicious as well. Will make a trip to Vegas just so I can go back and eat there again.
I had the all you can eat meal for 24.99. This place kicks ass.  The chicken and beef ribs are incredible.  Everything tasted great, the cole slaw had jalapeno in it and was an excellent side. I plan on stopping here everytime I'm in Las Vegas.
Was drawn to this place by yelpers.  We over ordered and there's nothing to write home about.  There's no smoke flavor, spare ribs were dry and cold, catfish soggy, and the rest is meh.  Dickies or Phil's would smoked this joint any day of the week and pun intended.  Oh, a little guidance during ordering would have avoided us over ordering...but after tasting the food, no wonder you're eager to push out as much mediocre meat as you can.  One and done for me.
We shared a single order - 1/2 slab beef ribs and a pork spare rib with jalapeno coleslaw and waffle fries - and finished only half of it and had to put the rest in a box. Enormous portion for the cheap can't be a bad thing, but ... ridiculous would be a better word to describe it.. . Seating outside felt nice on a surprisingly warm day in December.. . This is one of the best BBQ I've ever had, and... we're still giving 3 stars.. . Probably it's just that we're not that into BBQ. We must admit that we need some enlightenment to enjoy that part of American culture.
It was a bit too much about being BIG instead of being great. The best part of the Outlaw Burger (the obscene meat building in the photos) is the onion rings. I also thought the red cabbage was a nice touch. Baby backs are not fall off the bone, but good flavor. Really liked the homemade BBQ sauce sitting on the table. Sides: corn nuggets - OK, not much flavor; waffle fries - no Bueno, probably a frozen product and they were served cooler than room temp; Jalapeno Cole slaw - good (not great), I did like the contrasting sensation spicy and cool-slaw. This is a great place for families. And the price is right. Worth a trip - Yes.
I drove down from Henderson to try this place. Pretty busy inside. I ordered the meatloaf, two spare ribs, and mac and cheese.  I got this order to go, but when I got home no mac and cheese. I made a few attempts to call and left a message before I finally got through to a person.  When I told the guy who answered the phone that I was missing an item. He said "What do you want me to do about it?" Huh? I just spent 23 bucks there and I'm missing something. I will say that I'm pleased with the quality of the food. Just be sure to check your order before leaving...
This is the best BBQ in Vegas and quite possibly the best I've ever had. . . I ordered 2 Pit Specials to go and just sat and breathed in the delicious smells that envelop the entire business, inside and out. It was heavenly. . . The Pit Special consists of 4 meats and 3 sides. We got the brisket, pulled pork, 1/4 chicken and 2 spare ribs with kickin beans, bacon potato salad and onion straws with one order and cole slaw substituting the onion straws on another. I had to go up and place an additional order of corn bread, banana pudding and blueberry cobbler because the longer I stared at the menu, the more I wanted to try.. . The portions were generous and each Pit Special fed 2 of us. The meat was awesome! All of it! I loved the chicken and ribs. Juicy, smoky, perfect. The sides were all delicious. The beans were a little too peppery for me but still a great flavor and the cole slaw & bacon potato salad were quickly inhaled. Oh and the BBQ sauce was sweet and also perfect.  We stuffed ourselves.. . The staff were friendly, courteous and it was apparent that they loved their jobs. I see no reason to ever go to another BBQ joint in this town. Nothing else compares and I can't wait to try their many other offerings.
Outlaw burger was super-sized and only $8.99.  It had a full side of crispy onions onions on top of the patty.  Amazing burger at a good value.  The missing star is for a slight but noticeable lack of brisket (made up for by the overwhelming amount of delicious crispy onions) and my side of mac a cheese was decent, but nothing to write home about.  I had the chopped pork sandwich here as well.  It was good. It ain't Memphis BBQ, but It is the closest your gonna get to it in Las Vegas.
Probably the best BBQ joint in town. The meats, sauces and the prices are amazing. I ordered a meat trio combo for $14. It came with 2 Ribs, hot link, brisket, 1 side, 1 drink and a roll. Their hot sauceslack a little bit of  punch, but that's not a deal breaker for spice lovers. The meats have a good amount of spices from the rub and marination. . . Overall this is the best location to go for a lunch on the weekend. Lines can be very long during their busy hours. The parking lot is big, so you won't be driving around for a while to find a parking spot.
The best BBQ in Vegas or anywhere.  Rating should be eleven out of ten!  Outstanding!  This is the perfect hole-in-the-wall BBQ dive.  Real Southern BBQ.  There were six of, us three adults and three children.  Everyone loved it.  We ordered a variety of plates and items and shared. Everything was fantastic. The atmosphere, the "Mom" greeter, with her "Sweet Southern Hospitality", the menu options, and the food.  Break away from the assembly line chains and go here.  The brisket, ribs, corn nuggets, pork, hot links, potatoes salad, and meatloaf can not be beat.  Real home style food.  Our new favorite.. This place is to BBQ, as Lola's is to New Orleans style restraints in Vegas.  As good as it gets.. This will become a new local's favorite.  Get away from the strip, big celebrity names, chains, and gimmicks.  All you need for your BBQ desire is right here.
