I love this place, but my last experience while waiting was under par.  The waitress was very slow to take our order, very slow to let us know what we ordered was out, and slow to bring everything.  We normally can handle the two hour wait with great service from bar bianco, but this last visit on 12/26 was disappointing.  The pizza and service at the pizzeria was great, as it is always.
Wait for a table was almost intolerable ; 2.5 hours, wish my patience would have been rewarded with the world's greatest pizza. Sadly, it was not.  What a let down !
This is some of the best pizza in AZ and the country! I love the new Town 7 Country location. The space is comfortable and there is an expanded menu. Everything is delicious!
Being from New Jersey I know good pizza. This place is the real deal! The margarita pizza is unparalleled to anything in the area . This place is the perfect place to bring your date in the greater Phoenix area I am very impressed and I will definitely be back for more.
Pizza is great. Doesn't matter which one either. Grab a recommended bottle of wine. The number one reason this place is a 5 stars is the service. Service and ambiance make this place a must go to place with your family, friends, or business associates.
Pizza is gourmet and generally very good, although on the spendy side. NIce waiting bar in the next small building over, which is cozy and the bartenders are always very nice and attentive. With the usually long wait times form for dinner, I decided to stop by for lunch and was happy to get a table quickly. Too bad my pizza crust was burnt on bottom at this non-busy lunch service. It was edible and I had to get back to work so I didn't send it back, but was disappointed in the lack of consistency when they were markedly less busy than the dinner services I've usually been there for.
Best pizza ever. We got the rosa and the wiseguy. I expected to like the wiseguy better since I love meat, but the rosa was just AMAZING! Can't wait to go again when I am back in town. It is quite loud inside, would love to sit outside next time especially with such nice green space.
My husband Matt B. and I love pizza, so when we decided to spend a weekend in Phoenix, Pizzeria Bianco was at the top of our to-do list. I'd heard great things about the pizza (which is a favorite of Nancy Silverton's of Pizzeria Mozza) and rather frightening things about the line (five hour wait times, what?) so Matt and I met up with our friend Stef P. at about 10:45 on a Saturday morning. By 11, when the doors opened, we were one of two parties waiting for a table. We saw no line the whole time we were here, so maybe massive wait times are a thing of the past.. . The place was very charming, small and cozy, located in some kind of science center park that felt a bit like a college campus. Apple Maps did a shit job getting us to the right building, so we missed the free lot. Be advised that there is one, and that it's much closer than any metered parking. The restaurant felt like a new wave fancy pizzeria, with big ovens and a modern/rustic decor. Service was good, efficient and friendly.. . We drank beer with our lunch (I forget what was on tap, but it was good), and enjoyed the excellent pizza. Stef and I shared the Wiseguy and the Sonny Boy, while Matt had the Margherita. The pizzas were delicious, with flavorful crusts that were beautifully charred with a good amount of both crisp and chew. The toppings were high quality. The Wiseguy was probably my favorite, a white pie loaded with wood-roasted onion, house smoked mozzarella, and fennel sausage. That sausage was so savory, that onion so subtly sweet. The Sonny Boy was also a winner, with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, salami, and olives, meaty and full of flavor. I stole a bit of Matt's Margherita, and it was a top notch version of the classic pie, with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil.. . Now that I know Pizzeria Bianco comes with no hassle, I'll stop by whenever I come through Phoenix. The setting is nice, and the pizza hits the spot. Its reputation is well deserved.
The pizza is as good as advertised. Believe the hype!
What can you say?  Some of the best pizza in the world right here in Phoenix.  You think you come here for the Mexican food, but the Italian food is some of the best.  Chris has made this a comfortable place to visit and the food is incredible.
I think that this place is great! The first time I've been here and the service was amazing as well as the food. The staff is super friendly and attentive and the food is fresh and delicious. Couldn't have been a better experience.

The one and only (well, not anymore). This is the famous Bianco location. Eating here got a lot easier once the other locations opened and this location started opening for lunch. Best pizza ever. No question.
loved it

I finally came here and waited the 1.5 hours for a table because coworkers have been telling me about this place for the last three years. The pizza was very good. I especially liked the one with pistachios. I don't recommend ordering a pizza with meat on it because the meat will overpower all of the other flavors on the pie. . . I'm glad I finally tried this place, but I don't think I would wait that long for it again.. . Props to the guy with the Mario mustache behind the counter.

We stopped in with a large party of six.  It was the first time my sisters and our spouses have all dined out at the same time.  The restaurant is super small so we were lucky to have been seated in the back with three adjoining tables.  Service was prompt, friendly and to the point.  Since there are no fountain drinks, refills nor replacements were offered for our bottles of Coke.  . . The Margherita was simple, saucy, light but flavorful.  I love a good Margherita pizza and this pizza hits the high notes on my taste buds.. . The Sonny Boy was also pretty tasty thanks to the fatty salami and delicious gaeta olives.  Some said it was spicy, but I didn't notice.  . . The Rosa was definitely the most interesting.  The nutty and oily pistachios melded nicely with the red onions and Parmigiano Reggiano and Rosemary.  . . The Biancoverde was my favorite overall.  The pungent flavor of fresh arugula and rich creamy finish of ricotta cheese complimented this pie nicely. . . The Wiseguy was good, but I was expecting so much more from the fennel sausage.  The wood roasted onions were kind of tough and lacked the pizzaz I was expecting.  . . Overall, Pizzeria Bianco is a solid place for thin crust individual sized pizza. At $13-$18 each, we opted to split five of the pizzas amongst six of us so we could try them all.  Luckily, my brother-in-law wasn't too hungry and left the majority three slices behind. . . We ordered five out of six pizzas on the menu and even took two more of our favorite home for Mom.  At $150 for pizza, if you're looking to feed picky eaters, you're probably better off leaving them at home.
The wine and cheese platter was awesome!  We ordered two pizzas and both pizzas were delicious.  . . BIANCOVERDE:  Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula. SONNY BOY:  Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, olives. . Dessert was awesome!!!!!!!!!  Flour less chocolate cake.  And vanilla gelato.  . . I was rolled out of there!  :)
Not bad, but certainly overrated.. . I had been told many times that this was, under no uncertain terms, the best pizza that could be had in this region of the country. I strongly disagree with that, but that doesn't make it the worst either.. . Here's the rundown:. - Long wait. - Tiny building. - Parking Shortage. - High Prices. - Small Portions. - Better Pizza is available elsewhere (where some of the above problems are less present or absent entirely) . . So, really, it was good, but I have no reason to go through the hassle of coming back when I have better options available. It was an interesting experience, but it's a one-and-done for me.
