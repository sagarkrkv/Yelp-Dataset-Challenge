I will rate 1. Hotel, 2. Casino, 3. Kids venue, 4. Overall quality. 1. Hotel rooms are okay 3.5 stars. The elevator system gets (1-generous heavy weighted star). We stay here every year and its the same thing every year. When 10:30 to 11 AM rolls around, everybody is trying to get out of the building, however the elevators are so slow that it takes 40-minutes to get down. By the time it gets to your floor they are already full. If you don't have luggage, take the stairs, but if you do, prepare to wait for a ride and stop on every floor.!! THE ELEVATORS SUCK.!!!!!. 2. Smokey Casino is okay, nothin special, 3-stars.. 3. (2-stars) The smokey mid-way is old and could use a overhaul, but my 5-year old son knows no difference and loves it. The circus acts are entertaining too, this is why we come back every year. Very crowded so get used to bumping into folks. Adventure dome is fun too, but pricy. (Not smokey) The rides seem a little old and a little young for my 5-year old, so we didn't spend much time there this year. (3-stars).. 4. Overall, this place is okay (2-stars), very smokey, pricy food, dirty, old; nice upgraded rooms but getting out during checkout time is a challenge because of the  HORRIBLE ELEVATOR  system. Circus Circus gets a well deserved 2-stars mostly because of the smokey venue and horrible elevators.
A very old smelling casino with dirty carpets, it definitely looks its age in comparison to the newer ones, or even ones the same age. Idk how the rooms look, I imagine not all that great, and its on the upper end of the strip so it's quite a walk if you're staying at the more popular ones, but that can be easily remedied by catching the Deuce, which stood right in front. . . this place's saving grace is definitely it's theme park, which is really fun for all ages, and the fact that it has circus acts from morning to evening in its pretty big arcade park, the acts themselves are actually pretty good too. Circus Circus is definitely for families and the young at heart, and it's worth stopping by to check out these things  :-)
"You get what you pay for". . - duty room (before we arrive) . - no fridge in the room. - too much noisy (even in late time). - room still duty (3th day). - smell awful, even in non-smoking apartment. - I really dont trust in their cleaning service, its disgusting to be here. - It has being a awful experience   . . good:. - free parking. - free wifii
Yeah.... Such a shame that my favorite chicken in the pot game is here. So fun. And the quarters over the edge game.. . The employees look shabby and unhappy. Saw a father holding his toddler's hand and smoking a cigarette.
This is a great hotel for kids and elderly people and families because it has a lot of fun activities for children and Circus Circus Joe's and clowns and have a good bar in them good bartenders andmy wife really enjoyed the place and the kids love the clowns and I love to play with all of the cool adventures of like a indoor themepark here which is great for anyone who wants a thrill live crazy roller coasters and very fun rides it's just a little old the building but other than that everything is good
The Circus Circus is an underrated hotel and casino. The outside does not look very attractive, however the inside is much better.  All of the workers that assisted me were very helpful. The the man at the lobby desk, the card dealers, restaurant staff, and the crew in the sports book were friendly and helpful. . . The restaurants that I recommend are Vince Neal's and the buffet. The food was very good and the price is cheaper than most on the strip.. . My room was apparently newly renovated. It looked like everything was new, and including the bathroom everything was clean. (I have added some photos). . . I will defiantly stay here again.
Ok, I'm behind on this review but I had to leave one! I was in Vegas last February, I told you I was behind, and I stayed here with my niece, son, mother, and sister.  Upon arrival we asked for an early check-in, we arrived early that morning and didn't want to wait. We were able to get the room early and it was $20. I was very impressed with the room, clean and big! I was never a fan of this hotel,  but I must say, they have improved. . . Everyone was extremely nice, beds were soft, bathroom was nice! My son and my niece LOVED their stay in the hotel. . . We ended up having to stay an additional night. I was able to add theadditional night over the phon! The woman I spoke to was so nice and it was quick and painless! The restaurants were ok, but I wouldn't recommend the buffet! . . I will definitely come back with my son!
I should have known when I told my friends I was staying here and their faces looked like they had drunk spoiled milk that we had made a bad selection. . . First of all, it's a tough hotel to navigate. You might be staying on the 4th floor, but only on some poorly labeled tower. The elevators don't clearly indicate where they go, so I had the experience of going to the 4th floor and seeing that my room was on a different 4th floor. Cool. The elevator to get to my room was tucked behind the meeting rooms. Cooler.. . The valet put the wrong number ticket on our car, so it took them 20 minutes to get it. Coolest.. . My favorite part of the stay was when I used my key to get into my room, then went to the vending machine to get water and came back to find my key stopped working. First of all, what? Second of all, when I went downstairs (which is quite a walk from the room) to get this straightened out, they informed me I couldn't get back into my room without my ID. When I explained my ID was in the room, they basically told me I was out of luck. Eventually, the person who had the room under their name had to come and yell at them so I could get back in.. . Their buffet is terrible. Everything tastes the same. They have very strict security (lots of chains) to get into the buffet, which is weird because no one would want to sneak in after tasting the food. We got the buffet for free because of the aforementioned key snafu and it was still awful. They should have paid us to eat there. They probably give out comps to it all the time because no one would pay to eat there. And they serve Pepsi. Eugh.. . The shower worked, though.
Unfortunately thanks to circus circus my family and I experienced the worst family weekend getaway ever. I showed up on Saturday night to check in to my SKYRISE room that i had reserved. When i arrived i was told i had to be downgraded into the Manor Motor Lodge as the Skyrise tower was being remolded, something they forgot to tell my travel agent. Upon talking to the manager she informed us that she could not walk us to another hotel, as is typical with every other hotel. She was nice enough to offer to drop the resort fees, which was not going to work for my family as my siblings felt insecure staying the night there, which was also why we did not reserve a room there in the first place. Unfortunately i was forced to cancel my room there and ended our trip just minutes after we arrived there.
This is for the west tower. I can't speak on any other towers that they have. But this one is not too bad actually. And for $20 a night it's actually a steal
Hotel needs to be updated. Upon arrival to our room we opened the door and the smell of weed smacked us in the face. The safe had an old pair of old stinky loafers. The water pressure in the shower was terrible and it took forever to rinse out my hair. The room was not very clean. Trying to park close to the tower you were in was a cluster. Rooms were cheap, but like they say "you get what you pay for"  definitely will not stay at this hotel again.
What a fucking joke. Book a room in the west tower and get here to find that they OVERBOOKED so they stick my ass in the manor lodge that is less expensive, without refunding the difference. I WAS a frequent guest at this hotel, staying here every couple of months but after this stunt, that will not be happening again. This is how you treat loyal guests? You just lost one.
I rated this two stars because of the folks who work here. Everyone has been great. They are courteous and pleasant... but the "Manors" could use some work. The walls are so thin I had the opportunity to witness a complete argument between next doors inhabitants.  For the love of all things holy... she WANTS the pan cakes!!! And, I don't care who bought what or that you spent your last ten bucks on... STOP yelling, or even... talking at 6 am.  Coming back after lunch, they had their TV on normal volume and I swear I could follow the entire show!. . The hot water lasted about 7-10 minutes in the shower, and wouldn't shut off all the way. My wife had to wait 15 minutes for it to build back up... The casino was hard to breath in - circulation sucked. The safe is closed and locked in the hotel room and noone could open it.. . Honestly this lil gem could be great. A little leadership and this property could soar!! We won't stay here again... but I suppose it's good for for a bunch of dudes/girls coming to party and not care about where they sleep... or a with a bunch of kids that will wreck it anyway.. . Oh! And the "F--k Me" smeared on the wall behind the door in some unknown black substance wasn't quite the greeting we had expected.  Thank you for handling that so quick and giving us extra coffee, sweet cleaning Lady Maria! She had a smile and was so nice!. . UPDATE: (I dropped a star.)  A loud, wierd buzzing goes off at 7:15 am on Dec 15th. My wife goes to check it out because the sounds are unfamiliar. She calls the front desk and is met with a shorr, frazzled and very put off attendant (whom I'm sure has answered several calls about the same thing). She says it's a fire alarm and was a prank. I understand stress... but yikes! Anyway, of course she couldn't know what I do for a living. She couldn't possibly know that I know that the intermittent strange and loud buzzing in the hallway doesn't randomly sound off when a pull station is activated. No, that's a continuous alarm. So, was it a faulty sensor? Did an employee try to reset the control panel? Who knows... but being rude to an abruptly awoken GUEST of your hotel? Bummer folks. Absolute bummer. (Did I mention now the neighbors are awake now too and once again TV and conversation fills my room. So much for sleep.)
Staying at this hotel made my stay in Vegas absolutely miserable. I never had thought that it would be so unpleasant.  It always smelled like smoke when I was walking down the hallway to my room. The floors were very dirty. The elevators were rusty and  every time I used to take it I was praying to god that it wouldn't snap off. It is at the end of the strip so all the main attractions are missed and it takes a long time by taxi or walking to get to the good spots in Vegas.
So I decided to stay here because hotels.com had the rooms for a good price. Found out where my dad and I were going to be in what room we went. Stayed in the Manor Rooms and got inside and the bedding was nice along with the tv cabinet. Turned the tv on only had like 6 channels.  Looked up and notice a water stain on the ceiling and the wall paper was awful. Okay so wen to bed at 1:15am. At around 3am someone pulled the firealarm and it was sooooooooooooooo loud my father and I woke up pissed off and it took maintenance like 2 1/2 hours to fix it. Sunday morning at 5:45 am again the firealarm was pulled yet again. So I was wondering is still a everyday thing. Oh an the people in the next room were talking so loud we couldn't sleep. I will NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN unless it's in the other part of Circus Circus and not the Manor Rooms
Dirty, old, and run down. Only thing I'll give it is the cheap pricing. In a pinch, you need something quick and cheap, go ahead and stay there.
Well where to start? I hadn't been to Vegas in about ten yrs, and I hadn't stayed at the circus in about fifteen... Big disappointment...they sent us to the manor eww!! Shoulda listened to you helpers. I had no idea that they were gonna send us there, it's like another walk from the main circus hotel and the rooms looked old and smelled old. Never again will I stay there. If I would have known...
Checking was horrible as check in man didn't know any info on our questions. We booked for our daughters birthday and only on arrival did they say the dome was closed down.  Then we asked to speak to someone else and they stated it was not closed down. Then he oplogized and said he didn't know.   Finally arrive in room and bathroom is so small you can't shit with the door open and or stand to take a piss. View was of construction. Carpet left our feet so dirty we walked around in socks but only to have those ruined as well. Carpets are filthy. They promote HDTV but only price standard channels. So no HDTV. Also the block you from changing source and preventing my daughter to play PS3 they so block buttons on TV. Luckily the PS3 turns the source automatically when turned on. As I called desk lady she said we block all those features. Lol well to bad Circus Circus I still was able to change to HDMI source you money greedy hotel. Took my daughter to the dome and she showed no interest. She was more into Vegas lights.  Lmao After 2days we left to another hotel. We checked in on a Wednesday and was going to stay until Tuesday 6days but left and never stayed for her birthday..  Sad in stated this to them and they didn't care. Just want to talk about money...
Not the best hotel for adults but for kids it's the best. Check out their indoor amusement park for kids. It's great! The casino is an average vegas casino with all the table games and slots. . . This hotel is actually not that bad. Some good restaurants and the employees are courteous. Lots of parking!
The price and location were ok. But the room's walls are too thin. I didn't get a good night's rest because the people in the next room were so loud. If the walls were thicker I wouldn't be able to hear them. My tip is to bring ear plugs.
Very disappointment. Nothing to do with what they show online. Once I got to the hotel they sent me far away from the main hotel and the room was so dirty, dusty and old, the bathtub in bad conditions. This place is worst than a cheap motel never coming back.
Didnt stay here but came here for the free shows. . The waitresses for the free drinks near the slots are awesome and goos wins lol maybe it was my luck..  Anywho! Bought the drink mugs for $14 &$16 & refills are $6 throughout the hotel!! We got free drinks and poured them in our cups lol so great..  I wouldn't recommend staying here seeing that their are a TON of kids (unless you have kids its the BEST CHOICE! !!!!!!!!! ) & everyone has access to come to the room hallways which I would not be comfortable with. . Overall nice hotel, not close to monorail or las vegas blvd.
This is the best value hotel and casino in las vegas. . 1. Free circus shows (where else in vegas). 2. Friendly staff and casino floor smells great. 3. Lots of things to do at the midway, great for kids. 4. Our room was clean at all times (west tower). 5. Affordable restaurants inside. . The only downside is that it is further up on the strip and away from the center of the strip but we had a rental. . The location is not bad if you are looking to visit downtown too. . All in all for the price it was great in the best tower for 35/night. . Those that complain need to go pay 350 somewhere else for a deluxe room
This is probably one of the most family friendly casinos in town. I went with my wife in November and enjoyed 2 dollar jello shots at the bar! Wow they were strong and bigger than a normal jello shot. We both had 1 drink at the bar and the margs were right on the money.. . We played slots for about 2hrs and won around 100 dollars and change. The drink waitress was very friendly and wished my wife a Happy Birthday. The free drinks were just right and we wanted to stay but had so many other things to do. . . The amusement ride section was very fun and you are asked to stop to take photos. We bought a photo package for 20 dollars and they came out great. The stores inside the casino are very reasonably priced and did most of our Souvenir shopping here.. . Of all the casinos we went to (10) we had the most fun here! We will be back in April!!
This old casino has done a great job to keep it going strong. Their kids adventure park is a breath of fresh air in the sin city where the kids can have some great fun. My kids really enjoyed their time here. So good to be at circus circus!  The actual hotel I can not write anything about since I did not stay here.
nobody clean up the floor.  i fell on the floor after left the kids playground.  i was looking for someone and noone around.  i went to restroom to clean up and finally saw a security guard.  it took about an hour to file a complaint.  i am very disappoint...because what if an elderly or pregnant lady fell ?  i was thing to come back, but NO after this accident.
Unfriendly staff and they don't even have toothpaste, toothbrushes or shower gel when we requested for these! Had to run out to get these basic essentials middle of the night. Will never stay here again.
Came here with my kids to enjoy the evening...the staff is super nice...however we walked out in 30 minutes...due to the fact that it reeked of cigarette smoke...I understand people are entitled to smoke...but I think that an hotel/casino that is family oriented and cater to kids should ban smoking...there is no reason why my kids or other innocent babies be exposed to second hand smoke...someone has to start a change...it should be a heavyweight like Cicus Circus...I would even book a stay here...if smoking was banned...FYI...I WALKED OUT WITH A BAD HEADACHE!
I had theworst experience at Circus Circus.  I checked into the hotel and checked out 10 minutes later. We were booked in the Manor, when we walked in the room it smelled terrible, there were stains all over the carpet along with what looked liked cigarette burns, stains on the ceiling and the walls. I called the front desk and they said they would not move me so I decided to just leave. And now they have a $600 hold on my credit card. So please, don't stay at Circus Circus. The hotel workers were even telling me that they would never stay at that, hotel.
Been coming here for many years, always great service, not too expensive and great for kids and adults alike.  Gambling is relaxed and fun, many new upgrades have been done.  Great atmosphere
I forgot to mention about the room on my previous review.. . . This is my first time stayed at the circus circus and should be the last time.  The hotel room is very old and dirty.  I had been to some other old hotels, but they are CLEAN.  Circus circus's room is very dirty.  I booked this hotel because I wanted to take my 7 years old daughter to enjoy indoor playground.. . 1. carpet is wet and sticky.. 2. The room has very strong cigar smell, but the room should be smoke free room.  ????. 3. blankets are old and dirty.  My daughter (7 years old) and I was very itchy and hopefully I did not carry any bed bug back home.. 4. restroom floor is sticky/dirty and I can smell the restroom smell.. 5. small restroom and small tub. 6. wall is very thin and I can hear sounds all night long.. 7. we stayed at the manor which means is far away fromthe main building.  I need to drive to the indoor playground and to the hotel casino.. . I been to Las Vegas so many times and this is the worst stay ever.  . . Good luck to others like to stay here!. . I will have to go see doctor today because my skin is still itchy.
