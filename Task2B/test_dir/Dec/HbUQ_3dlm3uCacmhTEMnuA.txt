Average Vegas steak house. Nothing that blew my taste buds away. Your pocket book might for a subpar experience. This is a missed target on the range of upper echelon steak houses and really should not be considered one except for their overpricing
Unfortunately it did not live entirely up to the hype for us.   It was definitely good overall, but for the price point ($225 dinner for 2), and the Chef's awards, I expected a lot more--perfection, or darn close to it!. . The appetizers of shrimp and oysters were fantastic.  The big problem for me was the Caesar salad.  It was warm, slightly wilted like warm lettuce is want to do, and just pretty lousy in flavor.  I've had better Caesar salads at inexpensive chain restaurants.  I was also disappointed the staff did not notice or remark that neither of us ate the salad.  A whole entree sent back to the kitchen unnoticed.. . The steaks were cooked to perfection and we very much enjoyed the butternut squash risotto.. . We did not get dessert because the choices were less than stellar for gluten free options.. . Overall, the food was good, but minus one star for inedible Caesar salad, and minus one star for no gluten free dessert options (sorbet and strange flavored ice cream does not count). . . I would recommend you try this restaurant, but temper your expectations.
I was very excited to try out Tom's restaurant. I was traveling on business and eating alone so I sat at the bar.The bartender/wait staff was excellent. Very helpful when helping me navigate the menu. . . I ordered the 10 ounce filet, the sauteed kale w/ white beans and bacon, and the fingerling potatoes with rosemary. In a word AMAZING!  The steak melted in my mouth, the kale was to die for and potatoes were the perfect compliment to taste explosion in my mouth. . . This is a must on your dinner list when in Vegas.
My husband and I went here for my birthday on 11/24/14.  We had the angus steak tasting menu.   I've been reading reviews until I was blue in the face trying to figure out how many courses and how the tasting menu worked. This is how it works.  Everything is family style except the soup.. First, you get lobster bisque.. Then they bring some appetizers - we had proscuitto with pears, an heirloom tomato salad with champagne vinaigrette and Italian buffalo mozzarella with hazelnuts and balsamic.. then you get your steak - we had ribeye and filet. with sides - we had potato puree, brussel sprouts with bacon and roasted mushrooms. Then, dessert - we had orange basil sorbet and rum raisin ice cream, a fruit plate and sweet potato cheesecake.. Then, for my birthday, they brought out the monkey bread with banana ice cream.. . My favorite parts were:. the lobster bisque.  I love it anyway.  Hubby never had it and he loved it.  It comes to the table with just lobster in the bowl and then they pour the bisque over the top.  So, big chunks of lobster in the bisque.  I LOVED it.  The flavor was amazing (i think i tasted sherry in there, which is YUM).  I could eat a vat of that.. the filet was perfect.  We ordered it medium rare to rare.  it was medium to medium rare, but it was melt in your mouth delicious.  The ribeye was great too, but next to the filet, it was definitely second fiddle (as you would expect).  . the monkey bread with banana ice cream - this was just perfect perfect perfect.  I was sad I had to share.. . the not so great:. proscuitto. - i like proscuitto, but it was just proscuitto on a plate.  come on, man.. rum raisin ice cream - way to boozy.  the raisins must have been soaked in rum and then covered in rum and then tossed in rum and then the ice cream was mostly rum.  super rum rum rum.  ew.. . There is SO MUCH food.  Hubby and I left some behind - we were very sad.  and we practically rolled out. so, bring your appetite if you get the tasting menu.  . Now that I've done it, I will probably go back and just get the bisque, filet and monkey bread, but I suggest giving the tasting menu a shot at least once.  . . the wait staff was incredible.  It was a fine dining experience that wasn't stuffy or uncomfortable.  Blue was our main waiter and he was just so great - helpful and accommodating and just plain nice.  There was another waiter that stopped by here and there to make sure everything was perfect and I wish I could remember his name, but he was really nice and personable as well.. . Only one bad thing, there was a photographer who came around and took some seriously cheesy posed pictures.  Then, later came back with them all printed out to sell to us.  I didn't even like the pictures.  I didn't want this intrusion.  I hope they stop this practice.. . All in all a great experience.  I was torn on where to spend my birthday dinner and ultimately chose Craftsteak because I knew both me and hubby would enjoy it and I have ZERO regrets.  I think this is going to be one of our must stops in vegas from now on.
Great service and great food. Both the Wagyu skirt steak and Wagyu New York strip (medium rare) was cooked to perfection. Warm centers and warm on the outside. However, I think my boyfriend and I over did the ordering. We were extremely stuffed and did not finish our food. We split the lobster bisque (did not smell like seafood) and the Wagyu tartare. Everything was delicious and not over done, definitely coming back.
You gotta do at least 1 fancy dinner in Vegas and staying in MGM and this was most convenient for us. We were seated right away with Opentable resos and checked out the really warm, wood-filled decor on the way to our table. We were seated and told we had 2 servers because 1 was in training. Ok, cool. We had the complimentary bread (the best part of everything), bottle of wine, lobster bisque, salmon for me and ribeye for him. Service was a little odd, again with 2 servers. It seemed like they didn't communicate well and didn't know if we ordered something or the tables near us. It also took forever and a day to get our meals. . . The lobster bisque was as cold as Chicago in February and this was no gazpacho. My fish was good but the veggies paired with it were crazy bitter. I don't understand why they'd pair these together. Hubby loved his steak and said it was a game changer since he never orders rib-eyes. They gave us little rich chocolate squares for celebrating our anniversary and brought the bill.. . Idk if they were trying to be slick or a genuine error, but they charged us one of the most expensive wine bottles in place of the regularly priced one we ordered. We had to wait quite a while for this to be corrected, since the server in training didn't have authority or whatever to correct the issue. It was fixed but just left an even more bitter taste after all those bitter greens. . . I was hoping TM's would blow me away but it was just ok.
I recently took my wife here for dinner as it was on her bucket list of restaurants here in Vegas.  I had a reservation, we were seated almost immediately upon checking in. We were seated at a table for two kind of in the middle. The noise level was a little high, which didn't really bother us, the table is pretty wide though and without the option to sit side by side made for some difficulty having any conversation. This was a little disappointing in that I had just rocked her world and she was so excited and it was difficult to share in that. The service was great, being addressed by name was a very cool touch. The food, mostly amazing, except her steak which was overdone and dry (upsetting to me a bit as this was her surprise dinner) but like a trooper she didn't let it ruin anything. I am not wealthy so this was a special night, I am hoping to be able to take her again (after some saving lol) and this time get her a properly cooked steak and maybe sit in a booth. This time, 3 star for the seating and the steak. I will reserve judgement and a 5 star rating for our next visit. Having been to Ramsey Steak we had pretty high expectations. As it sits now Gordon Ramsey Steak 1 Craft 0 hopefully we'll even that up next time.
I have to admit that the food is really good but I can't get past the cost ratio.  2 people at $600 plus is just to much to validate the experience.  Its the perfect choice when someone else is buying!
Good but frankly I expected more. Service was slow. Beer selection was average. Sides were average and I had better steak at triple George's in old Vegas. Super expensive for what our experience was. Went there to wine and dine a customer and we ended up poking fun at the service. I have to assume TC has a higher standard and I am sure it's only a fluke.
HORRIBLE customer service. Scheduled an anniversary dinner here, and was flummoxed when I tried to let them know we'd be running a bit late (15 minutes), as it was an unusual rain storm that had snarled traffic. First, the woman who answered the phone couldn't seem to find the reservation. Second, the fifteen minute grace period was obviously not okay with her. I was told the only other available time was three hours later. When I told her that we could either be there, but fifteen minutes late, or not come at all, she opted to accept that we wouldn't be coming and spending money there. What??! I mean, not everyone can have TOP CHEF money, but still. Craftsteak is not in need of building a client base? Give me a break. Clearly, the customer service of Tom Colicchio's staff is non-existant. Instead, hubris and bitchiness prevail -- almost like TOP CHEF itself.
I'm not sure what's happened here.  The service is still great, but the quality of the meat was really different than when we were here last.  We ordered the bone-in ribeye and it was chain grocery store quality at best.  You know how lower grade meat has that mealy texture?  We ordered it medium rare and it was still that way.  We were really disappointed because the last time we were here it was a delicious experience.  Maybe their purveyors are pulling a fast one on them.  To be fair, we are used to prime steakhouses and this wasn't listed as prime...but we still didn't expect it to be as low in quality as it was.
Expensive but delicious! I had the surf and turf and it was amazing! I would go again.
We had the tasting menu and it was too much food for two people...  The frisee salad, skirt steak, and brussel sprouts were our favorites and based on portion sizes from the menu would have been enough for us to share.  The wine pairing was fabulous!  The service was amazing.  It was a great meal.
Very disappointing meal...  We take a yearly trip to Vegas and always have a steak dinner on the last night.  We've hit a them all on the strip, but this is the first time I've been truly disappointed. They were out of a few of the items on the drink menu. The steaks were mediocre at best. In particular the prime NY strop was extremely bad. No flavor at all and there was so much fat and connected tissue that I couldn't even eat 3/4 of it. Upon telling the staff, they were in different. No apology or effort to make it right.  I've had better steaks and service at your middle of the road steak chain on the side of the highway. I would not return and would recommend going elsewhere. On top of everything else they have a photographer walking thru taking pictures of you like you are at an amusement park...quite tacky!  Go
Great steak options and a full menu of great appetizers and entrees to choose from.  Our party of 4 all loved the steaks we chose.  I really don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.  Great service...very friendly!
Made a reservation on Open Table and got seated right away. We were staying at the MGM and decided to find a good dining establishment right here in the hotel for the convenience. CRAFTSTEAK did not disappoint!. . Food:. . 1) Roasted Beet Salad $13: this dish was beautifully presented. My favorite part of this dish was the pickled egg that was dyed pink. The acid definitely brought out the sweetness in the beets.. . 2) Butternut squash soup $16: They bring out a soup bowl with pancetta lining the bottom of the bowl. Then they pour your butternut squash soup into your bowl. The soup was creamy and delicious.. . 3) Wagyu Skirt Steak $78: Heeding the recommendations of several Yelp reviews, I landed on the Wagyu Skirt steak. I love skirt steak because you can really taste the beefiness. What made this skirt steak so special was that not only was the flavor on point, it was SOOO tender! I usually have problems chewing on beef because of some dental issues but with this steak, there were no issues at all. I was able to savor every bite and enjoy it. This was the best skirt steak I have ever tried.. . 4) Angus Rib Eye $55: a nice hunk of beef! I usually get rib eye whenever I can but I was happy that my partner ordered this. It was meaty and fatty, just how a rib eye should be.. . 5) Our sides approx $13 each: maui onion, yukon gold puree, prosciutto butternut risotto: we enjoyed each of the sides that we ordered. . . 6) Monkeybread with banana ice cream $15: It didn't take much convincing to order this dessert. Wish it came with more ice cream though!. . Total cost of dinner came out to about $300 after tip. We definitely had food leftover and packaged it up to go. It was STILL very tasty the next day!!!
12.28.14. . Now that I'm older and have no desire or energy to go clubbing when I'm in Vegas, I've found another way to blow my hard-earned cash.. . $$$$ restaurants definitely fit the mold. Unfortunately, Robuchon was booked up through the week, so plan B it was. OpenTable reservations were plentiful for Craftsteak, so this was nice and easy.. . We waited a bit to be seated. We waited a bit longer to get our drink orders in (highland fling for him, malbec for me). And even longer between courses. Service was spotty, to say the least.. . Portions, however, were generous. I'm glad we settled on sharing one appetizer (the lobster bisque), one protein each (short ribs for me, kobe skirt steak for him), and a side (shishito peppers).. . Lowlight: the lobster bisque was way over-seasoned, and didn't really signal a great start to the meal.. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tom-colicchios-craftsteak-las-vegas-2?select=g3iit_zkN6Fw0eDJhvqzDg#g3iit_zkN6Fw0eDJhvqzDg. . Saving grace: both the short ribs and the skirt steak were cooked perfectly. The ribs came out steaming hot while the skirt steak was a tad cooler - perhaps was waiting for the other dish to be finished before being brought out all together.. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tom-colicchios-craftsteak-las-vegas-2?select=g3iit_zkN6Fw0eDJhvqzDg#03DW_mPIiZEWZA0mEoTb6w. . The shishito peppers were a good balance, but we could only finish half the plate given how large the meat dishes were.. . Overall: glad I checked this off my list, but no desire to return anytime soon.. . Total damage for two: $229
