Still in Las Vegas. Very late dinner yesterday at Sushi Samba and great experience. Wagyu beef carpaccio fantastic. Samba roll. Pork belly and kampachi neck were amazing. Waitress was very nice, service impeccable. A must try guys
Came in here for a quick snack while shopping. Service was slow and the food took a while even at the bar. Got some riceless hand rolls, but the fish was just ok. I've had better sushi in Vegas.
This place is amazing. Food was amazing and service was even better.  Our waiter took the time to explain the menu and made several great recommendations.  He even offered to make us a menu based on our price point per person. Portions are a bit small, however the quality is top notch and everything tasted so fresh.  Every dish we tried was excellent but my favorite was the Chilean sea bass.
Not likely to return after what was supposed to be a great 30th Birthday Dinner.... . Eleven of us arrived a few minutes before our reservation and I checked in while we grabbed a few drinks at the bar. We were seated just shortly after our check-in when our whole party arrived, which was great, but after that our time at the table seemed to be an unsuccessful long one. We weren't seated with menus and waited quite a while for some info as to what was going on. When our server, Justin notified us that the Chef usually likes to do a "tasting menu" for larger parties bringing us items geared towards our tastes we thought that sounded pretty good. He left us to talk it over, and when he came back I asked him if he was sure it was going to be enough food and he said yes we would all leave full so eight out of the eleven in my party decided to try it. With that being said, it wasn't even close to enough food. Edamame, fried green beans and roasted peppers along with what totaled up to be a little more than one sushi roll for each of us and a few skewers of chicken and what looked like a single portion of steak, we all left hungry.. . I will say the food was delicious, there just was not enough of it and each of my guests felt guilty not wanting to eat more than others. Several of my party asked me if there was more food coming, but after we received the meat portion that was it. Justin was nice enough to bring a round of shots over for the party, but this was only after two people in my party, who had skipped on the preset menu asked about how much longer their food was going to be after they had ordered it almost thirty minutes earlier! The food was finally brought out with some apologies and my friends ate while we all sat and waited for them to be done. They had insisted it just be cancelled because they felt so bad for us having to wait for them, but I told them to go ahead and eat their dinner. To my surprise, the order that had taken almost thirty additional minutes to come out was still on their bill. . . I wish our experience would have been better and we would have left full and happy from an enjoyable birthday dinner, but instead I left feeling embarrassed that my friends and my experience wasn't a better one. . . I will also say I tried to reach out to the restaurant directly about my concerns and was told someone would contact me on November 21st... needless to say I never heard anything.
To start off this place is not a traditional Japanese restaurant if that's what you're looking for. It's Peruvian, Brazilian, and Japanese fusion cuisine. Def one of a kind of place. It has an ambiance for a nice meal right before a night on the town. . . I've been here quite a few times. Came 3 times for omakase. Which is amazing. And of course the sashimi, I could inhale it. . . My favorite was the oysters and Kobe beef. Which is cooked on a stone. . The tacos there are so light and fresh.. Our server was really nice and definitely felt out what we wanted during omakase. Ah I wish I remembered his name. . . Also the restaurant was busy and we came a little late but the girls up front did their best to accommodate us. Also very welcoming. . . If you're not looking to spend too much, check out their happy hours for a quick bite to eat :)
This restaurant came highly recommended by a friend who said this is a must go in Vegas. My own experience was that the food was good but not the very best as I thought it would be. We ordered the scallops, the duck, the oysters, the teriyaki chicken, coconut rice and the beef dumplings. The dumplings was my favorite. Others in the party liked the scallops and the oysters too. Maybe we should have tried the wagyu beef, but were too tired and hungry to try cook it on the table.
Sushi Samba has some excellent tasting libations, meat dishes, and appetizers. Their beverage manager is doing an excellent job with menu and service. The Sakeoke (karaoke in the back bar) needs some help. The song list is short, the DJ is a little clueless, and the signage for the nightly event is sorely lacking. Don't worry if the front staff seems a bit pretentious; they are. But the back room staff and managers are great. The food is pricey when you don't realize that you ordered your 5th drink after your third song. You'll find it easy to make new friends at the karaoke. Have fun.
HHMMM Sushi what more can I say I am a fan of it..... . SS is an awesome place to have just the freshest Sushi in town. . The atmosphere is cool and the bar staff and wait staff rock.... . I go to the bar 2 times a week and it is the same each and every time. . SS has a different vibe from most Sushi places they mix Brazilian with Japanese and it works..... . You will not go wrong with this place
I ate here last week. I initially enjoyed the ambiance, the nice wait staff, and the wide selection of sushi, robata, and cocktails. However, our food and drinks were littered with inedible garnishes. One of our drinks contained inedible wood sticks and leaves, while the plate came with a side of hollowed out crustacean appendages.. . While I understand that the harvested tree parts add to the flavor of the drink, the crustacean carcases added nothing to the plate other than to disgust their customers. It was sickening. I almost sent the food back, but I decided to give it a try.. . Fortunately the food and drinks were decent. They weren't memorable in the sense that I will tell my friends and family about it, but the food and drinks were a good attempt at sushi, robata, and cocktails. I would give the quality of the food 3 stars.. . However, when I spoke with the manager about the disproportionate amount of inedible food on the plate, he was extremely rude to me. Instead of explaining why the presentation was the way it was, he simply said "this is the way we make it," and he walked away. Anyone in a customer service centric job can tell you this is the wrong way to respond to a custom complaint.. . At the end of the evening my wife and I were left feeling that we were overcharged, under-served, and disrespected by the management. I could forgive the obvious technical errors with the food if the staff was more communicative, but the interaction I had with the evening under-experienced manager only added insult to injury, which is why I give this restaurant 1 star.
3.5 stars. The nigiri sushi was good, but the salmon roll we had barely had any fish and was overpowered with the add ons (mozzerella, sauce, crispy onions), so it didn't taste like a sushi roll. The yellowtail taquitos, Peruvian corn, and shishito peppers were also good. The rice pudding had too many flavors and the pineapple was not fresh. I really liked the lemon samurai cocktail, but would have enjoyed it more if it came out before our meal. We had 3 food items prior to receiving our drinks. The service was good, nothing remarkable. Decent meal but not a place I would revisit.
Had to pick up tickets for the Panda show so I stopped here for lunch with the Family.  Sat at the sushi bar and admittedly, I'm a sushi snob so take that for what it's worth.  The fish is slightly above average and the rice is ok.  Perhaps the other stuff on the menu is worth investigating, but I wasn't interested.. . I will give credit for 2 things.  The kid's sushi box is a great value.  My daughter truly enjoyed it all.  Secondly, the Yamato Roll is tasty.  I don't do rolls, but this one includes foie and ostera caviar.  For me, well worth the $19 price tag for 3 pieces.
Service is INCREDIBLE! Our server was really cool. We ordered a tasting menu. This is the way to go. You select your price they take care of the rest. Tanice asked about our food preferences and based on that she created a menu of different courses to suit our taste. The food is delicious but it's the service that will make me come back. Throughout our evening Allen the restaurant manager came by to make sure we were having a great experience.
One of the best restaurants in Vegas. Here is what to order: rock shrimp, yellowtail tacos (taquitos), Sea bass skewers are a must. Optional WARNING very expensive - Wagyu steak cook on hot rock. You can also do some of the sushi but do not miss out on the first three options. Enjoy.
I took my daughter there for her 21st bday - Rico was our waiter/bartender. He was BEYOND FABULOUS! And Jeremy, the manager, treated us very well too. Food was AMAZING! I will be back - thanks to you both!!!
Amazing service! The staff is absolutely incredible and the food is unbelievably delicious. Highly recommend the El Topo roll. Also they have a back club area that has karaoke which was a blast!
I was in charge of making reservations for a large group on our recent trip to Las Vegas. My first phone call was to Sushi Samba, which was (previously) my favorite Las Vegas restaurant. Sadly, they really let us down this time. . . When we arrived on a Thursday night, there was a sign letting us know that there was a filming in progress at the restaurant...interesting, since this was never mentioned to me in the three phone calls I'd had with the hostess (one to make the reservation, one to confirm, and one to move the reservation back an hour). The lights were up and the music was off, which wasn't the typical fun atmosphere I've come to expect.. . We sat down and were immediately approached by the filming crew. Turns out, they were filming a promo commercial for the hotel and were wondering if they could film us. We were promised free drinks and appetizers, so we agreed and signed their waivers. We then had a full crew come over to light the table and were joined by the on-air host. He asked us questions about how much we loved staying at the Palazzo (we weren't staying there), brought out a round of drinks (which were essentially fruit juices with fancy garnishes...looks good on camera, but nothing we would have ordered), and proceeded to help himself to our Wagyu beef (at $32/oz). Our waiter was nowhere to be seen until the bill showed up....a bill which reflected absolutely no compensation for the ridiculous experience. . . I calmly asked to speak to the manager. The reason Sushi Samba was one of my favorites is because of the food and the experience. While the food was still tasty, it was completely ruined by the absolute lack of service that we received, especially given that we'd done them a favor and agreed to be in their commercial. We never received any discount on our bill, but I did get the manager's card and a lukewarm promise that if I called him, he'd make it up to me next time. . . There's not going to be a next time. Do yourself a favor and go to Nobu instead.
Prix fix bachelor party menu. $85 per person.. . Probably like 9 course sample appetizer menu in which you get stuffed.. . Wagyu cooked on stone.!!! Awesome.. . Sea bass skewer is just ridiculously good. Also get 3 rolls along with desert that includes a Peruvian churro?. . well worth your money.
I personally wouldn't recommend this.  It is really expensive, and you initially think it is not until they tell you that they are Tapas style servings of the food, and even then it is not really enough to feed people.  I thought it was really overpriced and didnt think the food was that good.  I had a sushi roll and it was just mediocre and cost around 30.00.  I think that with all the restaurants on the Strip, you would be better off skipping this place.
Omg gyoza is a must!! Never had such a amazing one! My LP loved the pumpkin puree, it is worth every penny
We had the most amazing dinner at sushi samba last night! The food and atmosphere are fantastic and the staff isextremely helpful and competent! They took care of us and our birthday girl going above and beyond! Shout out to the manager Jason being a great host
By far the best sushi, sashimi, tempura, green tea I've had. Great service! Do try the spicy tuna roll! Totally recommended!
My favorite place in Vegas. Top quality fish, and great flavor combinations. I recommend getting the combo of all 4 sashimi. The desserts are also works of art that taste great. They are big and can be shared. My wife said they are the best desserts she's seen in America.
Service A+.  Staff was very accommodating and great.  Food was overpriced and terrible. 1 star for great service but would have rather had crappy service and great food
We stayed at Palazzo over the holidays and decided to try out this place.  I had made reservations for 9pm but arrived about 20mins early and was seated right away.  Overall a decent experience.. Ambience:  Dark and somewhat trendy sushi fusion joint.  There is a bar area but the rest of the tables are set up in a funky circular fashion.  Tables are pretty close to each other and you will not have a private dining experience.  . Service:  For the most part good.  We were seated right away.  It did take a while for the server to get to us (and she apologized).  She didn't give us the Sushi Samba intro like I heard another server give the table next to us (explaining the whole fusion thing).  Orders were taken and things proceeded to go smoothly.  There were no mistakes on our order.  We asked for sake recommendations and she appeared really knowledgeable.  She was decent in explaining their omikase (pretty much no set omikase).  Food came out at a decent pace.  Water was refilled quite nicely too.. Food:  Past review said that this was a great sushi place.  I disagree.  If you want the best sushi, you don't go to a fusion place in Vegas for it.  If you want to try a different twist on japanese/brazillian cuisine, then this is the place. So I went here without much expectations.  Highlights included the Yellowtail taquitos (more like tacos).  I loved the sauce/foam that came with it.  Very light and a nice way to wet your appetite.  Sea bass and Lamb Robata (sp?) were both really really good.  There was a sweet sauce on both.  Sea bass melted in your mouth.  Came with 2 skewers.  The lamb was a decent size and was sliced thinly.  This was also a melt-in-your mouth experience.  I would order both again. We had one of their specials which was a white fish in a tofu sauce.  It was just ok.  We made the mistake of ordering a roll.  I think it was an El Toro (or something like that) and it came with salmon, cilantro, mozerella cheese, among other things.  The flavor was ok, but the rice in the roll itself was really hard.  Like they had premade it.  Made the whole roll just awful.  I like their sake selection.  We passed on dessert.. Value:  Just like vegas, things are pricier. But I thought the vibe was decent.  . . All in all, a decent date night place.  Just don't come expecting over the top sushi.
Interesting blend of sushi, peruvian and brazilian cuisine. I had heard raving reviews of the place so had high expectations. We ordered a number of small plates, being a pescetarian, our meal was restricted to fish and vegetarian items. The shishito peppers were delicious. The Peruvian corn was authentic. We ordered a couple of pieces of nigiri sushi - they were well cut and the rice was warn to the right degree. We had also ordered a salmon roll, it was so so, you could hardly taste the fish, there was too much tempura wrapped around. I had ordered the caipirinha was it was excellent. The service was somewhat sloppy, we placed the drink and dinner ordered, but the drink took forever and the shishito peppers were actually served before the drinks. 3.5 stars.
Don't believe the positive reviews. If you've had really good sushi before, this place will disappoint. What makes it really not worth the money or time is the rude wait staff.
Didn't know what to order here so left it up to the waitress to determine my tastebud's fate. She asked us simple questions and ordered items based off of that keeping in mind a budget we provided to her. Overall, I would give her an 8 out of 10 for her effort.. . It's been weeks since I've been so sometimes, that really helps me remember what was memorable if I mention it in my review. The uni was super fresh here! There was also a mushroom dish that came with a poached egg on top, that was also to die for. I also really enjoyed the sea bass yakitori, this dissolved in your mouth like cotton candy! The sushi rolls that came out wasn't anything special, but knowing that, I'll probably stick to some of their more inventive dishes. The dessert was some kind of banana flavored one- can't remember how to describe it, but it was a winner in my book.. . Overall- it isn't too bad of a spot to check out at least once if you want to try something new. The likelihood of me returning is not that high but based on that one experience alone (along with the service), it was a solid 4 stars!
I think our waitress was new because she was really confused and awkward but that wasn't really an issue since the food was amazing!. . We got the tasting menu and you can choose if you want to pay $50-$100 pp, so if you've never been here it's a good way to go. The waitress will ask you if you have any food allergies and what you can/can't eat and then will bring out 5 or so appetizers and 2 types of sushi (if you get the $50-$60 pp) and then will let you know how much money you have left  and you can either use it to get another dish or use it for dessert which is what we did.. . Everything we got was good but the best one was the sea bass...so delicious!  We also got the yellow tail tacos,  wagyu beef goyza, tempura green beans, tuna app, some sushi and the green tea chocolate dessert. Looking back at the menu now I don't see all of the items we got so it's a bit confusing like some of the reviews say.
Sushi Samba in Las Vegas is always a favorite, and my wife and my dinner there last night was another spectacular experience. The food, service, and decor are always top notch. The usuals  (all four tiraditos, tuna taquitos, samba tea, waygu gyoza, miso butterscotch pork belly, aji Amarillo chicken robata, ceviche, and neo Tokyo roll) were mind blowing.
This has become a must eat place by my family when in the Venetian complex. The food is consistently worthy and Fresh. The wit staff service is exemplary. The Manager brought us new items at no charge, and it was great. They even have fried collard greens for us Southerners.
it's not worth its price!! The taste was just so so. The waiter always recommended us the expensive food but not good food!
