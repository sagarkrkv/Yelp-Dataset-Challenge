Great service creative dishes.  I love the sage chicken and waffles. Eggs Benedict with spinach is awesome.  The pancakes are huge!
If I'm ever feeling famished and want some really good comfort breakfast food, I  go to this location of Hash House a Go Go for large mounds of food.  Service is friendly and brisk.. . Order any entree and it will be enough for two.  It is a literal mound of food on a plate.  I love the fried chicken and waffles here.  The chicken is dusted in some rosemary giving it a nice herb flavored crust.  The batter is not to soft or hard, but has just the right crunch to it.  The waffles are bacon waffles.  How can you not love bacon waffles.. . They'll also give you a to go cup for your drink if you ask for it.  That was new to me.  I had a nice Arnold Palmer on my drive back to LA.
I highly recommend the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. I've had it many times before. I usually go to Hash House whenever I'm in Vegas. I've been there numerous times always accompanied by others all of which have agreed that the food is really good!. . The portions are humongous! Where else can you go and get a tall can of beer served in a brown paper bag?
The food is quite tasty but must be shared to be enjoyed. The portions are too huge and you can't take it to go very easily in Vegas. I do always try to stop in though when I am in Vegas. Get the chicken and waffles dish
I rarely write reviews but I really wanted to share this info. The prices are so reasonable given the generous portions, fine quality, fresh ingredients,vast menu choices,GREAT coffee,beautiful enviroment,location & parking. ALL the staff is friendly & professional. In this day & age I'm heartened to find such an establishment!
I don't understand what is the hype about this place. Based on the ratings, I decided to try it myself. I got the chicken and waffle breakfast and my husband got the man vs. food house special. . . I was surprised by the portion because their hella huge. Its like a meal for two. I am a big fan of chicken and waffle breakfast but I was not impressed with theirs. First the waffle was soggy so I asked for the waffle to be crispy. When it came back to me, it still wasn't crispy but the server said that's their crispy. I asked for it to be almost burned. I waited patience and started eating my chicken. It was actually good. But reminded me of southern style chicken. I don't care much for it. When the waffle came back, it still was not crispy. So I just gave up on it. . . I think my husband had the andy's sage fried chicken. It a bunch of stuff on a place. I don't even know where to explain. For me it was ALRIGHT. I would eat it but it was just too much to finish. On the other hand, my husband (who is a chef) did not care for it at all. So that was a total fail. . . Would I do back again? Probably not. We love good food and appreciate where what we spend our money on. This was just not one of them.
I really like the food here. You can tell it's prepared with a lot of attention and care. Love eating there.
Size matters.  But does it matter enough?  The first thing that strikes you about Hash House, even as your hostess walks you to your table, is the size of the breakfasts on the tables you walk past.  Ranging from ample to massive, the breakfasts seem to dare you to finish them.  Eggs Benedicts piled so high you have to peak around them to find your Bloody Mary.  Pancakes the size of a small trampoline.  You're going to need a bigger fork.. . But this is Vegas, and there are at least a couple of dozen hotels offering massive breakfast buffets.  Here, eating your fill is not enough to knock your socks off.  So, Hash House, what else you got?. . Well, as it turns out, they got pretty good food and a lot of attitude.  By "attitude," I mean a mildly "holier-than-thou" approach to their menu, reminiscent of Prius owners' approach to their cars.  Hash House makes it a point of pride that nothing on the menu is quite what you expect.  They offer a variety of Benedicts, but none of them with the traditional hollandaise sauce because that would be so, you know, traditional.  (I know that's the reason, because I asked the waiter.)  Breakfast potatoes are mashed or crispy-roasted, but not hash browns.  "Favorite" scrambles (according to the menu) are salmon, chuck roast, and smoked chicken.  And if you're really curious, you can order the "Old School Fried Mush."  (Don't ask me; I didn't order it.). . The service was friendly, but a little slow.  One of our party ordered hash with a poached egg on top.  The hash arrived, without the poached egg.  We asked for the egg.  Five minutes later, the server came over and told us that the chef had broken the egg and would have to cook another one.  Another five minutes, and the egg arrived.  Five minutes?  What, were they waiting on the chicken?. . Anyway, the one thing you have to say about Hash House is that if popularity is a metric, they must be doing something right.  Our wait to be seated was only about 15 minutes on a Saturday morning, but judging from the size of the outdoor waiting area there must be times when the line outside is longer than the dining room inside.  . Hash House is quirky, but definitely worth a try.
I am not one to give out stars liberally so when you see 5 at the top of my review, you should immediately drop whatever you are doing and go eat there! The food was A.Maz.Ing. My husband and I shared the Cobb salad, and the Indiana style pounded pork tenderloin. The salad was literally the best Cobb I've ever had. Adding balsamic and avocado takes it to a whole other level, who knew? HH did! The salad came in a bowl the size of a basketball, which more than compensated for the $14 price tag. The pork tenderloin was to die for. First, the plate was the size of a man hole cover. We are not talking small portions here. The sauce is an amazing mix of tomatoes,cream, and love. It is magical. I could eat a shoe covered in that sauce. The pork was so tender I could cut it with a spoon. (Not that I did, mind you, but I could've.) Our total bill for the 2 of us sharing these two items and a soda pop each was a reasonable $41, and we each had a to go box for lunch the next day left. I desperately wanted to try the cheesecake for dessert but I literally could not eat one more bite. The only criticism I have is that there is not one close to Seattle. I hope they get on that soon.
Worst service ever!!!! . . My family and I literally walked out of the restaurant, our waitress was extremely rude from the start she seemed upset that she had to take our drink order.  When she took our drink order she didn't return with our drinks until 20 minutes later.  As she began taking order she insulted my 10 year old step daughter stating she didn't look ten, immediately we asked for the Manger.  Chris the manager on duty actually stood behind us and watched everything transpire, we again requested to speak with the manager again, when another waitress( very sweet with tattoos) searched for him, when we realized that Chris the manager was right behind us we approached him, he refused to offer assistance when my fiance asked him if he was aware of the situation Chris then stated he was busy and that he didn't care and Merry Christmas.
I have been to this location a few times.  I have always enjoyed the breakfast menu. I recommend the pancakes. My only complaint is that the music is alway blasting so if you are with a group it difficult to hear across the table.  This place is very busy on the weekends but you can usually get in quickly weekdays. I will come here again.
Wow! First off, the portions are huge! I would definitely suggest sharing unless you are absolutely starving! My family and I tried the Sage Chicken and Waffles, the pot pie, and Andy's Sage Chicken Eggs Benedict. All the dishes, once again, were large in portion size, and tasted great! The chicken and waffles were a great combo specifically the crispy chicken with the sweet of the waffles and the salty bacon in the waffles! Then dunk all that salty sweet goodness into some maple syrup, topped with fried leaks.... A bite of deliciousness. I also appreciated the service, which was quick and efficient, friendly and helpful! Wonderful brunch spot worth checking out!
Pretty decent, huge portions. Expected more chicken for andy's fried chicken though! It turned out to be more carbs than chicken. The flapjacks and waffles were pretty good in terms of texture, but my friends didnt like it.
awesome amazing food...
way to go bro.....awesome amazing food...
Worst service. First, we were quoted 45 minutesbut then it ended up being one hour and 15 minutes. Pathetic. They should have a better system. Food is overrated.
Everything I've ever tried is full of flavor and just yummy. Portions are more than enough for 2 people, you might even have leftovers. They take pride in the presentation of their dishes, very original. If you've never tried this place you should, you won't regret it.
Completely worth the hype. The portions are soo huge a must share! The food is amazing. Great kids menu and great prices for what you get. I would definitely come back.
