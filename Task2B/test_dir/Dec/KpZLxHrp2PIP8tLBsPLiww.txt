The only reason i did not give this place 5 stars is the location. Although the hotel is connected to MGM grand on the strip you have to walk about a half mile through walkways to get to the casino. It is a pain because once you reach the strip from walking your burnt out. Hotel itself is great and rooms are huge compared to typical hotels. Price cannot be beat during New Years week.
Had a great weekend here Room was on the 34th floor wow amazing views.
The hubby and I recently returned from a few days in Las Vegas and were lucky enough to stay in The Signature at MGM Grand.  This was our very first stay here and it definitely won't be the last.  Our suite was on the 36th floor of the 2nd tower and had a balcony (the views were amazing!).  There was plenty of room for us and the bathroom was just open and spacious.  We had a stove, fridge, stove top and microwave in the kitchenette area.  The bathroom itself had a jetted Jacuzzi tub right next to a see through stand up shower.  There's even a small flat screen tv in there if you wanted to watch the tube while relaxing in the tub.. . All their staff are super nice and friendly.  We ordered room service and food was delivered faster than expected.  The gentleman wentway out of his way to make sure everything was set up right for us in the room.  . . I like that the Signature is non-gaming.  I'm not much of a gambler and it helps to make it less busy/crowded.  The hubby only had to walk a short distance along the connecting walkway to get into MGM for all the casino action so he was happy about that.  All in all we were very impressed with the The Signature in Las Vegas.  Next time we are in town we are definitely booking here again.  Would really recommend to anyone visiting sin city.
this place is FanDamnTastic.. . i booked online and finally found a great deal for a weekday getaway. after a perfect flight we checked in, and i was smitten by the beauty of the property. the staff was efficient and friendly. Maisha in en suite dining totally blew me by greeting me when we ordered dinner in, and her exceptional service was extended by assisting with last minute requests. thank you, again, Maisha!. . penultimate moment: there was a bit of an Wifi connectivity issue upon arrival and we had no Wifi until late into day 2. also, i had an Extended Stay scheduled for this trip but Housekeeping came to our room anyway. as i checked out, i explained to clerk Russell the aforementioned Wah and he promptly adjusted my final balance to make those missteps right. Russell is very polite and  friendly. thank you, again, Russell.. . i love this place-clean, friendly, beautiful and the staff was awesome. . I'm watching my email for a special promo so i can go back.
Definitely one of my worst Vegas hotel experiences:. . 1. The hotel room doors have nothing to stop them from slamming shut. This is not only a danger to children with heavy doors slamming shut, but guess what you will get to hear all night? Drunk people coming home and slamming their room doors. Midnight...1am...2am...3am.... . 2. The hotel is connect to the MGM grand and the strip...via a more than a half mile corridor one-way. There are moving sidewalks, but they functioned about 25% of the time during our stay.. . 3. Only half the wall electrical outlets in the room worked. Some had metal pieces sticking out of the wall.. . 4. Their "low-flow" toilet took 20 minutes to fill...that's 20 minutes between flushes. Hope your group isn't in a rush to use the bathroom when you get back to the room...
we check in on Dec 4 for 1 night. very  impressed how nice, clean and smoke free hotel.we stay 21st floor .we enjoy everythings there .be back again,
Worst service I have ever received at a hotel in my life. We purched a discounted room through living social. When we got here the room was disgusting! It was uncleared from the previous people. Hair all over the floor, sheets thrown all over the room, bathroom was dirty and shower too. We had to wait in this room for 2 hours with my baby waiting for a team to come clean it. I could not unpack, or breast feed my child. We had to sit with an already tired and hungry baby for hours waiting for them. Our entire first night was ruined by this! Our baby goes to sleep early so we were counting on a speedy check in so we could enjoy some time in the city but it was impossible. We missed dinner we missed site seeing we missed it all. Sitting in a filthy room trying to keep my baby from touching anything to gross
I recently stayed here for a staycation. This beautiful, modern, non-gaming complex of three high-rises is made up of condos, time shares, and hotel rooms. Indoor, covered walkways connect each tower and lead to the MGM Grand, making it a great option if you want to access their dining and entertainment, but don't want to sleep above the  smokey casino environment.. . The one bedroom unit we stayed in was gorgeous. It had a small kitchen, dining area, living room and half bath connected to the spacious bedroom and large master bath. The TV in the bedroom is tucked away inside a desk and raises when you turn it on. Unfortunately, it's not high-def. The best thing about the unit was the shower pressure. It's the kind of pressure I haven't experienced since living on the east coast.. . The third tower has an outdoor pool. There's a deli in tower 2 and a Starbucks and convenience store in tower 1. An ATM is located in the walkway outside of tower 1.. . If you can get a room on a high floor, you'll have a great view of the Strip, High Roller, and the rest of the valley. For the price (it can be very affordable depending on the week), it's a great alternative to staying directly on the Strip.
Wow just Wow! We stayed on the 33rd floor in tower 1 ( which is closer to the strip about 5 min walk ) . . Everyone here is so professional and upscale. Every time we asked for tea, towels, coffee, toothbrushes, etc... they brought up plenty.. . The Suite came with full kitchenette- oven- stove- microwave - toaster- blender- sink - even soap and kitchen supplies.. . Jetted hot tub for 2 people very roomy and spotless.. the King size bed was superb with soft pillows but not too soft.. Sheets were changed daily and always clean.. . Loved the fact that we had a huge balcony! The Hotel is non- smoking so this was perfect for us. We took our Hookah! . . The bathroom had the toilet in separate room and twin sinks for his and hers. A stone tiled shower w great water pressure and plenty of hot water. Full sized mirrors everywhere - Makes perfect selfie pics! . Lighting was excellent and lots of counter space.. Closet had two comfy robes, safe ( fits laptop) iron with iron board, and plenty of hangers.. . Room also had a couch with coffee table, desk with notepads and lamp. There is a separate cabinet for ice and plenty of cabinet space all around. . I could not be any happier with this Hotel. . Hotel also has a gift shop, gym and plenty of swimming pools and jacuzzis around... beautiful grounds super clean.. . Only cons were: TV had only one HBO station ( they are updating this soon ). Food service was excellent but food is pricey and bland.. There is a $25 resort fee per night but totally worth it.. Everyone was super nice and walking distance front the strip. The night was peaceful and we didn't run into one problem. I will def be staying here when in Vegas! LOVED IT
The rooms are forever from the casino. Very noisy on the airport side and they have a bullshit $25 resort fee we were not told about. The rooms are nice. I would suggest the one room suite it is bad ass and has a balcony. It is just to far ( 3 blocks to the strip) and a longer walk to the mgm
First impression of the SIGNATURE tower 3 at 145pm on Saturday 12/13/14 .... Walked in to the front desk to a guy that literally yawned wide mouth opened for about 15 seconds while I stood in front of him ... Did not apologize just said "last name." Your room is not ready till 3 so come back then. Id say his name but never introduced himself or said welcome to the Signature. Being in the industry was probably one of the rudest experience I've yet had. Guess we will see what happens at 3. Almost wanted to go behind the counter to teach him how to properly greet and treat guests.
Watch out for BED BUGS. Stayed in tower 2, pent house floors for halloween 2014. They did give us a new room but GROSS!!!
Ok ... I have to say there was some saving grace. When it came time for us to come back and check in were were greeted by PIA at the front desk who was absolutely wonderful. She remembered seeing us walking towards MGM with my 2 year old daughter while waiting for our room to be ready. She also did see by the time we got back both our little kids were tired and sleepy cranky so even if it wasn't exactly 3 she got the check in process started so that right at 3 she could pass the keys to us. A wonderful gesture on her part. We both appreciated. After long driving of 6 hours with two kids 2 or under 2 a welcome smile and kind greeting goes a long way. After that  everyone we met was more than helpful.  I would have given 4 stars but had to take one away because ofthe first encounter just stuck in my mind the whole trip. Well of someone in Management is reading this please extend our thanks to PIA and the rest of the staff for making up for that one front desk employees horrible 1st impression.
Cheating dealers and pit boss.. . I was at a $15 black jack game. A player turned over AJ. The Dealer offered even money. the player took it, and the dealer put out $15 to deliver the player's winnings.. . The dealer turns over a 21, the pit boss comes over and declares no even money bet allowed at the table !  The player's winning were taken back! I protested on behalf of the player that she had placed the offered bet BEFORE the dealer turned over, but the pit boss would not deliver the offered bet!. . From this moment henceforth, I shall never deliver a single dollar unto the MLIFE consortium on account of terrible customer service, taking advantage of inexperienced gamblers, and poor pit boss judgement.. . I had been hopeful of the perks of my MLIFE membership, but am now forever forlorn.. . G
Superb customer service... From the responsive valet to the assertive maids and bell hops to the front desk rep who took care of us (I believe her name was Tamika), I highly recommend booking one of their sweet penthouses overlooking the strip.
I prefer non-smoking/no casino type of hotels. It's quieter and a lot less choking on smoke. Not to mention people as well. I love that this hotel is gated, you have to have a key pass to get in, feels so exclusive except where it's located it's kind of... Bland. We're facing this really run down looking medical clinic and an empty lot next to it. It's kind of disappointing, but the hotel itself is pretty grand.. . ROOMS:. Booked three rooms on the 4th floor, thankfully ours is right next to the elevator so no getting lost trying to find it. Lol. The room is very nice and spacious with a very cool jacuzzi tub and stand up shower. They also have a small telly by the sinks so you have something to watch in the morning. I have mine tuned to the cooking channel! :D The beds are muey comfortable and the blackout curtains work wonders in the morning! It also comes with a small kitchenette to cook food! Only downside was that, not a huge fan of the design work, I like the more modern approach like Vdara's. So far only complaint is having terrible neighbors that blasts music 3am in the morning. -_- But called front desk and they took care of it right away.. . PARKING:. They have comp valet parking! So no worries about parking, just unload your bag and they'll give you a ticket for your car to hold onto.
The best thing about the MGM and Signature was the air quality. We were in most of the better hotels and the MGM's was always the best.  The Signature was great, room, staff and location.  Can't wait to return.
Nice rooms and exceptional service but the the valet wait is beyond terrifying.  And they only have valet parking!  They dont have any system here and all scramble mode.  Waited over an hour to get my car when checking out.  Pls avoid rush hours!!!
This review gets a one star based on the fact that this hotel made me miss my flight! Checked out around 11am and there was a 2 hour wait to get my car back from the valet!?!? There were like 100 people waiting to check out and thy had no system in place to get people their cars! Absolutely the worst experience with 3 little kids running around in the lobby. They could not even let us stay in the room a little extra for the inconvenience. James the manager couldn't find a solution to the problem and Jill the general manager was no where to be found. Absolutely ridiculous .
Great place to stay. Very close to the strip
If these guys give me a free room and $500 cash I wouldnt stay here. Its seriously by far the worst service... I cant even begin to explain. From initial parking, valet, bell desk... Omg!
** adding **. I just emailed their customer relations to file a complaint about our valet parking wait experience on 12/26.  we'll see what they say about this.. MGM should know better on how to handle these typesof situations.  understaffing excuse is not reasonable as customer spend alot of their $$$$$ to stay here.  making people wait for over than an hour for their cars outside is unreasonable and unexcusable.  they have been in this businesss for years!
We stayed for a few days.. before and after Xmas.. Suites are clean and decent. Has a Jacuzzi, stand in shower and TV inside the bathroom. Equipped with Microwave, Toaster, Electric Stove top if you plan to do some cooking. We had 2 rooms with pool views. House keeping is great. Valte guys are nice...Everyone was professional.. . ---FYI they do have a 32.00 resort fee +  tax PER DAY added your your room bill.. . Loss of 1 star due to 30-40 minute wait times for Valet. I know it's the holidays but this hotel DOES NOT have self parking. You HAVE to valet your cars.. . Will return and do recommend but I would stay elsewhere during peak seasons.
We return two years later and left with disappointment.. . Here's what goes wrong,. . 1. We booked a room with balcony this time, upon check-in, Tina at the front desk gave us room number 05607 in tower 1. As we get into our room we found out that instead of the jet SPA bathtub that we had last time, there's only a stand up shower.. . We thought this is due to the different room set up for the balcony room, but not until when we check out, we finally realized we're given a accessible room for the disable !!  We never made such request and I'm in my late 20s, I have no idea why Tina would gave us such room.. . Here is what it says on their official site:. . "Your Balcony Deluxe Suite experience includes:. . Whirlpool spa tub and separate shower". . In another word, they breach the contract and fail to offer what's promised.. . 2. A lots of stuff are missing from the kitchenette, there's no tableware, not knife, no wine glass, no pot, no frying pan, no nothing.. . Only thing left was some appliances and paper towel. I wonder if they got robbed by the last guest.. . 3. Like last time, we received $50 dining credit, but this time we could only spent it in The Signature or the MGM Grand, instead of restaurants at all other hotels under the MGM Resorts, so there's a lot less to choose from.. . Everything else was still great, free valet is still fast and convenient, room is still clean and well maintained. However, the Signature is no longer our first choice.
Don't valet park your vehicle!  My car battery was somehow dead and they recharged it right before i got my car WITHOUT telling me. I was lucky to get back home without knowing that.  And the next morning i couldn't even start my car.  I found that out cuz the battery positive cover was left opened and apparently someone charged it.   Man what if i got stuck in the middle of nowhere with no battery.   . . By the way I was forced to do valet cuz there was no self parking at this hotel. The closest was guest park but no one was willing to give us clear instruction on where this "guest" parking was. They only told me i could use guest parking "half a mile" walking distance from signature to mgm.
