2000th review my favorite club! Kaskade NYE 2013!! :D. Spacious and always the best DJs.. I love how there's an outdoor area and you can go to the pool as well.. Never had a bad night here!
This club sucks so bad. Supposedly I went on the best nights and it was literally dead in here. Drinks at the bar was good but the music is Terrible! Nothing but EDM and no Hip Hop. I believe clubs will never play as much anymore due to the hype of EDM. Their layout is just like Tryst only difference is XS is a lot bigger and doesn't have the 90 ft waterfall.
This place is big but the people are so rude! The floor was so nasty my heels would get stuck on the dirty ass floor. David getta or how ever you spell his name was the sj and I'm sorry it was horrible! No one was dancing it was so packed with old people just standing there being creeps.
The nightclub is one of the best that I have been to. But this past Saturday December 13th was not a good one. This was my third time going to XS, and for the second time of the three I was treated with such disrespect from the staff that works for the nightclub that I do not think I am coming back in a long time. They ruined my night and I felt so humiliated to be treated as if I was not paying for the service. Hopefully none of you guys will be treated like I was, and I feel like someone from the hotel or the nightclub should check their staff service.
This was one of the best experiences i ever had. .. One of our friends had forgotten her ID, so the best part was,we did not have to start from the end of the queue..the bouncer kept place for us and let us in straight away as we came back with the ID.. Ambience was fantastic!! Superb music with gr8 drinks!!
I'm being generous here.  I used to frequent XS when it first opened. It set the bar for Vegas clubs. This review is for table and bottle service. Unfortunately I didn't use my people for the reservation and my buddy and his crew used someone who didn't care. $3500 for a tiny booth next to the restrooms.  It's no longer got any class to it.  I've never been somewhere where so much money was being spent and I had my drink knocked so many times.  Half the time it was from a bouncer charging through the crowd without care. I has to dry clean everything and my new JV boots were scuffed beyond repair. I'd advise dressing down for this place. We saw our waitress 4 times for the entire night and she was difficult, unaccommodating, and moody. The place was also packed to the point where a sea of people were swaying through the room and we were literally getting crushed against our booth.  A shame as Encore is still a great hotel.
Had a blast at this club and thanks to Michelle she got us on the guest list and made our night even better. She is really awesome at what she does and made sure to keep in touch the whole time I was there. she recommend a few clubs and put me and my girlfriends on the guest list will definitely keep her number for my next Vegas trip. I recommend hitting her up if your in Vegas. Michelle # 9087703570 I Michelle_vegasnightlife Facebook: Facebook.com/Michelle.vivalasguestlist. . Thanks Michelle!!!!
XS is my absolute favorite nightclub in Vegas!. . The layout of the venue is great and I especially love the outdoor area; it's beautiful and even has a bar and tables set up for gamblers. But be careful not to get too schwasted and fall in the pool.... . Lines can get long so try to get there a little earlier. Contact a promoter to get you and your friends on the guest list to avoid paying a ridiculous cover fee. The ratio of females to males must be even in order for your group to qualify for the "free" pass.. . The last time I went, my friends and I (4 girls, 3 guys) got in for free, but only had access to the outdoor area... weird. There was a cover fee to get inside ($25/girl and $55/guy) but we hustled the bouncers and managed to get all the girls in free of charge. The guys, unfortunately, ended up having to hand over $100 for all three of them to get inside. But hey, better than $55 per person, right?. . Highly, highly recommended if you want to make your Vegas trip memorable (or not, if you drink enough).
Went on an Industry night.  So this of course means that all of the locals and that chill crowd is there.  It's a nice spot and we didn't have any trouble going through the line and of course the bouncers had the ability to be a pain in the butt but they weren't.  They were cordial and let us through with no issues.  The place is pretty big when you go in the summer but we were there during the "winter" months so we just allowed ourselves to roam.  Nice set up and it was packed but not so packed that people were stepping all over you.  As always, there were some creepers but we had a great time bringing in my husband's birthday.  I'd go to XS again only if I don't have to pay cover.  Great spot.
EDC's Insomniac crew held an afterparty here with Afrojack DJing and the crowd was non stop "ignit". Everyone looks gorgeous. Even the architecture and setup alone is magnificent. If you're into having a crazy and unforgettable night, make sure you rage it out here for some fun.
I TAKE BACK EVERYTHING GOOD I SAID ABOUT THIS CLUB! Came here for Kaskade on 12/20/2014 and it was absolute chaos! . . Pros: . 1. For how long the line was, we got in pretty fast.. 2. Kaskade . . CON: . Bouncers, the club pays you guys to conduct line/crowd control.. I HIGHLY DOUBT that they have ever instructed you to verbally harass and/or physically harm people! I was previously shoved by a bouncer here last year but I decided to overlook it because I had such a great time. BUT this time, I can no longer remain silent about it.. . Apparently, guests needed 3 stamps on their hands Saturday night in order to go inside for Kaskade. I heard this and was trying my best to cooperate with the bouncers to get out of the crowd. However, things escalated really quickly and got  completely out of hand. All I remember is hearing the bouncer cussing the crowd out and pushing us back forcefully. Heck... the crowd was not even pushing!  TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR! . . Final Verdict: . I come to Vegas to destress not to get stressed.. I am going elsewhere from now on! . Out of safety concerns, Management really needs to keep a close eye on this, because someone can really get hurt!
Not my favorite nightclub in Vegas but still a popular choice among my groups of friends. They always have some cool deejay being featured on the weekends we are there, which makes it difficult to get in if you're not on the guest list. For me, the deejay had better be freaking amazing because this place gets overwhemingly packed.. . XS is HUGE, both indoors and outdoors. It's absolutely gorgeous during the day or at night. Everything from the lights to the furniture is breathtaking, and even if you go to experience being surrounded by high class glamour, it's totally worth it. Just be careful not to fall into the water when you're not dressed for it!
This club is  a really beautiful indoor / outdoor club, that I would definitely recommend seeing if you have the chance. The reason I knocked a star off was because the night we decided to come everyone else in Vegas was also trying to get it (cascade was playing that night). It took just over an hour to get through the promoter line (no cover though) and they were giving the ladies one free drink.. . Once through the line, there are two pools that are part of the outside part, both of which make a beautiful view. The club was so packed, be careful not to fall in (I saw that happen!). There are heaters outside so it's fairly comfortable even though it's December. . . We didn't make it to the inside part of the club, because it was just far too crowded to squeeze through. Next time in Vegas I will try to go on an off night to enjoy the whole club.
Fist time in Vagas after many years and of course confused because there is so many places and so crowded. One of my friend introduced me and my friends  to a promoter name Chris Cowette. We contacted Chris and right away he responded and gave us all the information that was needed to get to XS night club. . When we got there Chris warmly welcomed us and took us to the table . Inside XS night club  was amazingly beautiful and the DJ was playing the best music to a point that i did not want to stop dancing ( even though i was so tired ). Through out the night Chris was there to help with drinks and any questions we had ( trust me once you get drunk you all of a sudden have lots of question to ask )..  It was a great night and i highly recommend anyone going to Las Vegas going to XS night club and of course contact Chris for the best service . This is his number btw (702) 722-8585
Why it could be a four or three depending on if you bought a ticket for the Dj dance floor area or just guest list that is any other place not the main area.  I was here once Calvin Harris and I'll say this there won't be a dance floor for long so stay at the front and hold it in. . . On this trip I was here for Kaskade I literally saw everyone and their moms here it was madness.  . . If you are outside the dance floor there are plenty of places around to chill it's great and you get to listen to cool DJs and possibly dance with actual space.  Enjoy the sight of the pool and garden.  There is a lot of room to move around and chill outside the main dance area.. . Bartenders weren't bad and don't mess with the bouncers you're gonna make a scene by just messing with the rope.
Always an amazing time at XS!! Me and my friends have had bottle service there multiple times. Best service and world class DJ's, need I say any more? The staff are friendly and security make sure you are well taken care of!
