Quick Tips:. . 1. The fountain shows are approximately 15 minutes apart and run even into the night.. . 2. You can find comps and room deals both on smartervegas.com and through the MyVegas facebook/iphone app.. . 3. There are quite a few famous restaurants in Bellagio and among them in Sensi, check them out near the Bellagio garden exhibits.. . 4. Bellagio boasts the largest chocolate fountain in the world at their installment of Jean Phillipe Patisserie.. . 5. They are the last stop on a short tram between the Monte Carlo, Aria, Vdara, and Bellagio with an entrance a little past the gift shop area towards the conference room area.. . Bellagio is an iconic hotel. Featured in so many TV shows to movies (remember Ocean's!?) and has been around for quite some time. The hotel is loved by many because of the beautiful fountains that go on a water show every few minutes to the fact that they are a 5 star luxury hotel.. . The hotel campus boasts some of the best views on the strip. They are located almost in the middle of the action across from the equally beautiful, but dated Paris Las Vegas and next to the Cosmopolitan and Aria. . . There are many things to do besides gambling when staying at the Bellagio. Their pool is rather famous for its collection of fun fountains to swim under to the more refined atmosphere of other pool goers. I also can't stop raving about their exhibits that they change up every few months. We are about to visit for Christmas and can't wait to see how they've transformed the Bellagio gardens area. . . Besides the gardens and the pool, Bellagio is sandwiched between two high end shopping areas. The Crystals shopping center is reachable by a short tram ride and the Bellagio is connected to its own series of shops.. . One of the main attractions of Bellagio is heading to "O" the highly acclaimed cirque du soleil show. I've personally never been to the show due to its price, but it comes highly recommended from friends who have been wowed by the experience.. . And, of course, I can't forget to mention their own wonderful places to have food. From Jean Phillipe Patisserie which boasts the largest chocolate fountain in the United States and the best cheap eats such as pressed chicken basil paninis, to the more upscale Sensi restaurant, these are all awesome places to check out. Their buffet needs a little updating, but it's still a good stop for those who want to try it.. . Now, why after this pretty much gushing review does Bellagio only deserve 4 stars? Well, the rooms are still pretty dated and a little less advanced then the newer Aria Las Vegas. I think that the price point for the Bellagio is a bit too high. They probably estimate the value of their rooms based on the fact that it is one of the most iconic landmarks on the strip.. . Still, I prefer the rooms over at the Aria. Good luck to those staying at this awesome place though, I hope you all have a wonderful time!
Location is decent, within a 10 minute walk from Times Square. The hotel has a lot of charm, but the air conditioning couldn't cope with the heat wave. There was construction on our floor, but the contractors were considerate and there was always hotel staff there keeping an eye on progress and guests. The quad room was surprisingly large for NV . Didn't get a chance to try the bar or restaurant, but doormen were friendly and helpful
Stayed for a few nights. Initially they had me booked for different rooms each night but that was resolved for us. Can't say the same for others in our party and so there was a little annoyance of when they had to call the hotel operators to send up new room cards. The ambience was good and the fountain shows attracted the crowds. At the casino, didn't have to wait long to be asked if I wanted anything to drink which was pretty nice compared to when I was over at Aria for a few hours. Not sure if this was intentional or not but I enjoyed all the cocktails I had.
I had a pretty poor experience here.  Me and two friends came to Vegas to run in the Rock and roll marathon. - everything seems nice . The rooms were pretty small and a little dated but had very nice bathrooms and showers/tubs.  For the money though I don't think the room was worth it. But the night we got there (the night before the race) we went to bed early so that we could be well rested for the marathon. The alarm clock woke us up at 3am (mind you, we never touched the alarm clock - this was never turned off from before we got there). Being half asleep we just unplugged the thing.  10 minutes later it went off again.  We just started hitting buttons. Ten minutes later, once again it woke us up.  So I took it and put it in the hall way and tried to go back asleep so my marathon that we have all been training for was not ruined from lack of sleep,  the next morning we told the front desk but they didn't coven apologize.. . Right before the race. I bought a salad and took it up to my room I noticed I did not have a fork. So I called front desk. Who then transferred me to room service who then transferred me back to front desk. They all acted as if asking for a fork was an odd request. I stayed on hold with the front desk for ten minutes then finally he said they would have someone bring it up. An hour later I finally got my fork.  When I was checking out they said that I owed 12 dollars. I asked for what and they said room service. I told them I did not order room service and had them look it up - it was for the fork. So I filed an investigation and said I would not pay the 12 dollars because that is absolutely crazy to me. Especially islet since they never said I would be charged.
The service, decor and attention to detail here is amazing as you would expect from the FAMOUS Bellagio. They treat you like royalty, always check your key before you enter the elevator area and all staff is saying HI at all times. The casino floor is great, the lobby is great an the place is well worth the visit and stay. . . So why only 4 stars? This place is  a true tourist trap which them impedes on other services you may be in need of like getting a taxi. Expect at least a 20 minute wait in their taxi line and if you want too walk down to the strip, expect to fight the crowds that line up to watch the water show. They do have a back way to walk down, but that takes a bit of searching to get it done. This is the only drawback, as everything else was good.
This is probably my favorite hotel, and I also do very well here at the slots.  The down side is its owned by MGM and I am more loyal to the Caesar's Entertainment group.  . . I have stayed here a few times, usually as a wedding guest.  The Bellagio does a top notch job on weddings, and their prime rib is probably one of the best on the Strip.  I think it was probably the best wedding reception I've been to in all time.. . As a guest, the rooms are spacious, and classy.  Their check in process is pretty fast, which says a lot considering the volume of guests they have.. . The down side is EVERYONE wants to visit this casino, so there's wall to wall people miling around, gawking at the lobby, the holiday decorations and of course, the water show (which runs every 1/2 hour until 8:00 pm, then every 15 minutes).. . Overall a great hotel/ casino.
My wife was coming up and she has always wanted to stay at the Bellagio. I decided to surprise her with a premier fountain view from the penthouse suite. . . Well worth the smile on my wife's face! . . The service is top notch. We were picked up by limo at the airport. Our driver was awesome and very friendly. . . At the hotel everything was taken care of, we didn't need to lug our luggage around and checked in at the VIP lounge. . . The room was HUGE, the views were amazing. I can't express to you how comfortable the bed was. There were 2.5 bathrooms. The shower was a steam shower which was awesome. . . Everyone was extremely helpful. If you get the penthouse you don't have to wait in line for the buffet which saved us about 45 mins.
My husband and I hotel hop for this birthday bash. So that weekend we decided to stay at three different hotels and one of which was Bellagio. This place is really nice and we came back again for the summer. It gets really crowded sometimes but it's all worth it because they have everything here. Love their buffet for dinner and the Cafe for brunch. My family are always here for the buffet and brunch whenever we are in the city. Can't miss it.
The Bellagio was absolutely gorgeous!  It's completely immaculate despite the fact that some of it is under construction.  Our room was really nice--upscale, clean and big.  The service we encountered was top notch and I honestly can't think of one thing that could've been better (other than the construction walls up in the lobby).  Bellagio, you are a beautiful property and I can't wait to go back.  See you soon.
Beautiful Winter Wonderland. The Bellagio never underwhelms with they're Christmas decorating. It's always a must see when visiting Las Vegas. Cute polar bears made of flowers with frolicking penguins in a cute snow scene. Gigantic tree twinkling lights, with a train circling around and bright colored ornaments hanging from the ceiling. Lots of photo opportunities here.  Very festive and cheery. A nice break from gambling and rambling. . . Nice to visit and admire all the lights and Christmas decorations throughout the hotel.
I used to be a huge fan of the Bellagio. In my opinion, it was one of the premiere properties in Vegas. Key word: WAS. I wanted to get an upgraded room for a recent business trip to Vegas in early October. I was attending a lecture series at the Bellagio and I booked a fountain view room for 4 nights. Check in was fast. The art installation in the lobby was new and I couldn't wait to check it out. It is one of my favorite reasons for visiting the property. I was really getting excited about my stay. It wasn't until that evening that things started going downhill. I'm not sure if it is the Bellagio's club or one across the street, but the bass from the sound system kept us awake until 4am. I called the front desk to ask them if they were aware that the bass was so loud, it rattled our windows. I don't remember if they apologized or not, but they didn't have any rooms to move us to. The next day, I was so exhausted from not sleeping that I couldn't focus on the lectures being given. I missed a good portion of the day because I went to my room to take a nap. . . That evening, the bass started again. I knew my ability to pay attention to the next day's lectures would be a disaster like the first so I decided to check out in the morning and head home. The front desk was nice enough to credit me $112, which was nothing compared to the $450 a night I was paying for my room that I couldn't even sleep in, but here is where you need to pay attention people. Even though I checked out, they continued to charge my card for the next two days!! I contacted them about the charges and they said they would credit me the days back. I got my credit card statement and they attempted to steal $65 from me still!! I called and the lady at the front desk said, "That was dumb of us to charge you for 2 days of resort fees even though you weren't here." No apology. . . You can stay and play, but you better keep your eye on your credit card bill. After my last visit, I don't think the Bellagio is as nice as it used to be. Even the crowd seemed more down-dressed. I guess the upper class crowd has moved on to the Winn properties or other new casinos in town. Good luck!
We had a few issues with our hotel room..The room was very clean and the beds were ok.  . . We had no power in the outlet in our bathroom and I had to call the service desk twice to get it dealt with properly.  The first time they came up they claimed to fix it but they hadn't.  They offered turned down service but we found that we didn't have turn down service every day.. . We found the restaurants were over priced and didn't end up eating at the hotel and went out most of the time.. . I felt that $5.00 for a small coffee wasn't reasonable.. . Room was ok, location is great but we would likely not stay here again.  We found it too smokey as well.
I just completed a three night stay at the Bellagio in Las Vegas as part of a conference I was attending. Here are the issues I had with my room:. . 1) Bobby pins on the carpet next to the bed. 2) Clock was more than two hours off. 3) Number plate for the room fell off the wall in the hallway. 4) Door handle to the bathroom was falling apart. 5) Shower valve handle came off. 6) Shower head caked with minerals. 7) Bathroom vanity covered with water spots. 8) Dental floss on the carpet in front of the bed. . I reported the first two issues on my first morning, and the clock was correct later in the day. I mentioned the remaining issues to an assistant manager at the front desk on my last morning there. She offered to adjust the room rate or provide meal vouchers, neither of which were useful to me since I was staying as part of a convention where all of that was covered. I just asked that she make sure the issues were fixed for future guests.. . Back in my room, waiting for check-out, I got a call from the "amenities department" as they had a delivery for me. Turns out the front desk sent an apology card and a nice assortment of snacks for my troubles. Since it wasn't a chain hotel where I could request points as compensation I figured this was good enough and I'd be on my way.. . When I was on my flight home I got an updated folio from the hotel showing a single charge: a tip for $1.61 for delivery of an amenity to the room. Yes, that's right. They charged me a tip for the delivery of the apology gift they sent me.. . I e-mailed the front desk and the charge was reversed, but no apology was given.. . With all the hotel options in Vegas you can do much better than here.
At the shopping area with my family, great music, the decorations are great. Nice dinner at olives, just very disappointed with security letting 2 men half dress like Santa showing off???? Really? Is this appropriate specially with lots of families?? Come on security, don't let this happen in your property
The Bellagio represents the beginning of modern Vegas (circa 1999) where the city finally (re)found it's identity as the Adult Disneyland.  Prior to this during the 90's there were a bunch of unfortunate family oriented resorts opening up all over the place (New York, New York, Treasure Island, the very venerable Excalibur) all of which were forgetting that the first megacasino, The Mirage, made no attempt to try to court little kids because.... KIDS DON'T GAMBLE, DRINK or EAT (WELL)!  The Bellagio put the nail in the coffin of that nonsense and forever there on out the city has transformed into something far more aligned with the original spirit of the city than annoying families and $1.99 prime rib dinners.. . Unfortunately these days the Bellagio is a mixed bag and it's pretty much divided straight down the line between staying there and just going there to have fun with other resort amenities.  Just to get the key negatives out of the way fast: unless you're high rolling the standard rooms here are now pretty dated and not recommended at all in contrast to pretty much any of the new resorts.  If you haven't been to Vegas before I *know* you've seen Ocean's 11 and the Bellagio looks pretty pimp but trust me, you can get a comparably priced room at places like the Aria, the Mandrian, the Cosmo and sometimes the Wynn (although usually it's a bit more expensive) that is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better.  Unless they've recently renovated the rooms here are nothing special at all and definitely feel like they're from another era of Vegas.. . The good news is that much of the rest of Bellagio is still very cool and worth you time.  I could be seeing things but I feel like the Bellagio has a lot more tables for you to play at than any other casino in Vegas so that's pretty cool.  I'll save this for another review but Picasso is still a fantastic fine dining establishment worth your hard won cash.  Olives is a good place to sit outside, see the water show and look at the strip (although the food is just okay!)  The Bellagio Buffet used to be the reigning champ of all you can gorge gluttony but I think it's been supplanted in recent years by the Wynn and the Cosmo (although I don't go to buffets much anymore so your tastes may vary!). . So, the short version: Visit this place but don't stay here.
came here with my wife for a two night stay over the weekend in early December. . . The hotel is spectacular and immaculate. Everything here from floor to ceiling was designed with great care and luxurious materials. The hotel is so large it does take some time to navigate back and forth to and fro from casino, parking, front desk, shops, etc. we got a king sized bed room in the spa tower. The room was very large, probably ~600 sq ft. Bathroom had a shower area and a tub with dual sinks. Room has a large led Samsung tv with very refined high end everything ( desk, sofa chairs, and linens - linens are very soft and comfy). Room has a bunch of snacks and drinks, and a locked mini fridge (not complimentary). . While the hotel itself, it's location (middle of the busiest intersection on the strip), and it's grandness was amazing, the service was definitely sub par. This was the biggest disappointment because I've been looking forward to staying here for awhile. My story begins with the front desk, we were given a room after we checked in late on Friday near 7pm. The place was bristling with people but they checked us in quickly. However when we finally trekked to our room, there was a couple in that entered the room with luggage literally RIGHT in front of us in the hallway.... We didn't want to make the trek back to the lobby since it was far away so we called the Desk with the phones along the floor. They put us on hold for 3 to 5 minutes, which was frustrating considering we were pretty tired and saw how they can muck up assigning rooms to guests... They reassigned us to another room on a different floor and said our cards would work in the new room. So we again trekked to the other floor we were assigned, and Lo and behold, only one key worked......at least one worked, and we were able to get in... . . After we got settled we went back to the lobby and told them one of he keys didn't work and we told them what happened..... With no apologies, the lady who was helping us said.....this isn't supposed to be your room..... We were getting very frustrated now...because we weren't going to move or change rooms again...this was getting ridiculous.... After another 5 minutes she took our old cards and issued us new cards and said it should be fine now..... Without apologizing for any inconvenience. . . Now fast forward to check out day, we didn't have change to give to our cleaning person so wanted to break change. The gift shop next to the elevators in spa tower just said no without reason and told me to go to the casino for any change..... . . Additionally multiple times I was stopped and asked for my room card going up to the guest elevators (sometimes with and without luggage and singled out amongst other guests). . For $300-$400 per night stay... its dissapointing to be treated like second class citizens and discriminated upon.. . Stayed December 2014, traveled as a couple
The front desk was exceptionally slow and rude. I don't feel like a paying customer at all.... We booked a fountain view double queen room, but we're told the first night that 1. we did not pay extra $30 guarantee so we get either king fountain or double queen non-fountain, and 2. we can get room change the next day and 3. the prices are the same.. The next day they sold out again and we were unable to get our room because we booked only for 2 people, and only booking for 3+ will guarantee double queen fountain view. . They gave us ambiguous reasons with no consistency at all.. Finally we were referred around several times because non of them seem to keep a straight story and we waited more than 15 minutes for the manager and got a $30 discount out of the $200+ room cost.. Will not recommend to anyone. Just view the fountain from the outside and absorb the beauty, staying here will totally ruin your holiday mood.
Elegant, beautiful, and well set up; this place is great. It also has the best most convenient parking on The Strip.. I just wish it wasn't so expensive to stay, eat, or shop here.
Whenever I think of Las Vegas, the Bellagio Hotel comes to mind. With it's grand fountain in front to the conservatory full of flowers inside to the large rooms and great restaurants. The casino and hotel are grand and decorated with every last ounce of grandiour. Sadly, with competition so stiff amongst the hotels... some of the newer hotels with all their bells and whistles are capturing our attention away from all that is the Bellagio. Time to lower the rates to compete!
This review is for the "O" Theater employees. When a family shows up to pick up their (3) $200 per seat tickets for the show, perhaps you make eye contact, smile and refrain from making fun of previous patrons with your co-workers. Also, learn from or rather OBSERVE that your co-workers want nothing to do with your conversation nor want you whispering in their ear...WHILE WE ARE STILL STANDING THERE completing the transaction. Can this be construed as rude? Bellagio used to be one of the best ..... About 10 years ago, but we followed Steve Wynn to The Wynn many years ago and have never been disappointed.. . Exiting the show was by far the most unorganized exits from all shows...and I've been to almost every single Cirque show since 1984.. . The show "O" was fantastic, just the venue lacked any ushers, and was very unorganized, and the rude staff at ticket counter was pathetic considering we what we spent to see the show.. . Steve Wynn must have taken his well trained staff to The Wynn and Encore! Glad we stayed at the Wynn.
I have been a regular visitor 2x/y since shortly after it opened, and sadly I must say that I have had the quality of my experience decline to the point that I will now look to stay elsewhere.. The rooms are now dated and this visit, I discovered that my bedsheet had a large hole in the top sheet near my feet. And not for the first time my TV did not work, and after 1h I am still waiting for someone to look at it.. I no longer feel appreciated for my loyalty to this hotel.  I belong to the Mlife reward program and one of the most important benefits to me has been the buffet line pass which circumvents hours long waits.  Last night on entering the line I was told that because it was so busy, I could not enter since the higher tier members were having to wait too long in the member line....my only option was to get in the regular line and wait 2h.  When I called this morning, I was told that this was a new policy, but no one bothered to tell me.  I was told anyone can pay extra to get a line pass...this certainly does not cut back on the potential wait for upper tier members.  And this is representative of the changes that I see adding extra charges for many things.. There are huge crowds here which affect the quality of the visit with lines and masses of people everywhere.. In the distant past room upgrades and a late checkout were offered, but this is no longer something that I have experienced unless one pays extra.. No question the Bellagio has been a quality, beautiful resort at which I have always felt special, but unfortunately as a regular visitor I have seen the overall quality of my experience here deteriorate.  I have great memories, but things have changed and are not at all the same.. I feel that perhaps one of the Wynne resorts is a better option.. ......as I am ready to leave I return to my room and I am locked out (the hotel ASSUMED I checked out) and my call to the manger to follow up on my concerns has not been returned.. bye bye Bellagio!
As mentioned earlier - this money minting casino/hotel lost its charm as it once did due to lack of cleanliness/maintenance and over crowding. One expects far better experience at suite level prices. Wynn for us next time.
We stopped by here for their Christmas display and it was just beautiful!!!!! It's free, so definitely stop by and check it out. I loved the polar bears made out of carnations, amazing!!!!
Amazing!  This hotel is all around amazing.  From the moment you get off of the cab/shuttle/car your  are living the Vegas experience.   Located in the center of the strip, easy access to other attractions. . . Nice big lobby filled with flowers and lots of plants.  They have a small mall (LV, Armani, Chanel, high end stores) located within the mall.. . I have been here twice and the first time I went we got a room that was beautiful.  I man everything was wood, huge bathroom with marble floors, super nice comfy beds.   The second time we had a nice room also, but different.  It was smaller and the furniture was just average.. . The rates are a  bit on the higher end, but it is a nice hotel.   Worth it, I would recommend this hotel.
