For a place with such solid star ratings on Yelp, I think I was expecting perhaps too much. That or we ordered the wrong things and service was off that day? Located at the forum shops, we were surprised to see lots of empty tables. . . We wanted to start off with an appetizer so we ordered the white corn croquettes and they were delicious!! White corn anything is such a treat with all that sweetness. There was quite a thick layer of bread crumbs which I disliked but a minor complaint. . . There were a few tables around us enjoying ice cream sundaes so I was immediately drawn to that. Sadly, there were only two sundae options and both consisted of peanut butter ice cream. I am not the biggest fan of peanut butter, but we still decided to order the Euphoria Peanut Butter Chocolate Fudge Sundae. The crunchy hazelnut bits were my favorite part. Be warned that half of our sundae was SO MUCH peanut butter flavor/stuff and the other half was not so much. Unfortunate for me, guess which side I was eating until I finally decided to say something, to which my boyfriend said "wait, try this side!" :(:( . . Service was horrible. We literally sat there for what seemed like forever, while our waitress went to get our waters. After 10-15 minutes, I waved down another waiter who reluctantly took our order. By the time our food arrived, our waters had not. Grabbing the bill was another big fiasco. This was a simple dessert pit-stop for us, but definitely took longer than necessary.
When friends and families ask for restaurant recommendations in Vegas, I ALWAYS recommend this place because it's one of my favorite places of all times. My stepmom from China wanted Chinese food but I wanted to take her to this place instead and she was absolutely surprised at how good American food tastes. Then another time I went with friends from college and they all loved my recommendation. Everything on the menu is delicious!!! Recently when i tried recommending this location again, so SAD to learn on yelp that it's closed :(( will have to try the other locations on the east coast&worldwide.
