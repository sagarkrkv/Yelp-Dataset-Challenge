Suppose I will do this again since my previous update apparently was read by a humourless "Support team" member whose vision might be good enough to (incorrectly) determine lack of "new firsthand experience" but not the obvious number of confirmed check-ins north of the review (establishing that I have firsthand experiences).. . I did not watch a "reality" television programme and decide to type out a review afterwards. I did not read an article in the local newspaper and decide to update my year-old review because of that. I actually go to TI. . . I actually go to TI entirely too often. . . Alright, with that all being said: . - Bring back the Sirens show; . - Add a will call only window to the TI Theatre box office; . - Turn down the goddamn volume at Senor Frogs;. - Be different than the other corporations on the strip and cease the madness of the superfluous resort fees; and. - Bring back the Sirens show. . . TI has some of the most comfortable beds on the strip corridor, the slowest tram anywhere in the world still operating in 2014 C.E., and a cool elephant tusk carved into over several generations. - E
I love this hotel. I stayed here before and I thought it was just an OKAY hotel. But then the next time I came to Vegas, I stayed at the Paris, and it was horrible! So now my friends and I decided to go to Vegas to celebrate New Year's Eve, I told them to stay at Treasure Island. So we did, and it was a right decision!. . The hotel is nice, doesn't look like an old hotel. The bed is nice and comfortable, the interior is luxurious, the TV is flat screen (unlike Paris' that has old TV; bulky and has antennas!), and the bathroom is nice and looks elegant!. . The only reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is their Buffet. They don't offer a lot of variety of food, and their food aren't that good, but they do offer a pretty good deal for it; 2 people for a price of one. Not bad, but there are other hotels' buffets that offer better food.. . But yeah, this hotel is a great hotel for a pretty good deal
Thanksgiving 2014!!! We decided at the last minute to book an impromtu trip to Vegas with our kids (3 teenagers - 2 girls and our son). We booked via Expedia and the rates were great. At check-in we were assisted and treated warmly. We booked 2 rooms and were told that maybe our rooms would not be joining. In the end we were totally accommodated with joining rooms and a spectacular view of the strip. This was our kids 1st time and their socks were def knocked off. We were on the 24th floor, the view was amazing and the rooms were great. If you plan on taking a gaming console don't bother, the TVs are rigged to not allow for it. We didn't eat at the restaurants cuz the kids don't care for PHO and we had other places in mind. The staff was great, the hotel is clean and doesn't smell of old cigarettes. The view i think is the best on the strip we stayed on the South side with a spectacular of the Palazzo, the Venetian the Mirage. Out of all the places we stayed, i'd say we had the best view this time. Would def recommend a stay here. It's not the most expensive and its not a dingy crummy hotel. I love that you can just hop over to the Palazzo and the Venetian. . I recall the place being driven by the Pirates theme. This is no longer the case and the new management has brought the hotel up a few notches for the better. We'd def stay here again. Bell service and Valet service was prompt and on their game. Thanks for a great stay TI. Hope to stay there again real soon.
It's a good location, but if you're banking on an upgrade, think again. They didn't offer anything to me, maybe because it was thanksgiving? Or maybe I looked poor?. . The rooms were comfy and I like the location very much. There's not much restaurants or anything going inside, but a few but there was one restaurant that had people in it 24 hours. I think it's called Pho Noodle. . . You can walk to the mall through the over bridge, and you are right across from Venetian and two hotels away from Forum Shop (Caesar). . . I even called to check out and called for extra blankets. The resort fee was $25, which includes wifi, boarding pass print out, other coupons, pool, gym, and drinks. To be honest, you can go to the business center and just print your pass out because there's no code or authentication. . . I didn't watch the pirate show because I've seen it before. . . I don't mind coming back though.
We have stayed at TI around 4 times over the past 5 years. This visit the hotel seemed to be feeling it's age.  The rooms were more worn though still very spacious and received a strip view room for the first time which was awesome view. Comfortable but definitely aging.  About half of the escalators or other mechanical items were out of order, basically if you could get up, then down was stairs only or circle to another area of the property.  Staff was friendly enough but no real enthusiasm or providing much in way of overview of features of the hotel, just hurry you on your way and move on to the next guest.  We were supposed to get some kind of champagne service free but nothing in the packet from the front desk explained how it worked so never bothered.  . . Valet is a joke. Not enough staff and either poorly trained or poorly paid.  5pm on a Friday and they had two lanes open, one guy working and he forgot about the second lane.  You had 5 guests who waited 30 minutes to get service and another 15 cars that were served within 10 minutes, just depended on if you were in the unlucky lane. Morning was just as bad though plenty of staff working. Had guy that took four tickets, dropped one and didn't remember how many he took so left guest waiting for 30 minutes. Found the ticket and tried to hid fact it was lost, didn't bother to apologize and still had 10 minute wait to pull the car up.  . . On the upside,TI is very conveniently located to reach fashion mall and several other casinos. Parking is easy and casino is easy to move around. On downside, not that much in comparison to other hotels to get you to stay and dine or play, more likely to head out somewhere more fun. Or with better food. Even places like Gilleys had older crowd who was mostly eating and no real excitement. The island grill had best crowd though didn't make it there to eat. . . Gambling was low key, didn't play much but slots and didn't win enough to keep playing for long enough to count.. . Reasonable priced hotel, comfortable if older rooms, and convenient location would be reasons to stay. If looking for young crowd, high energy or exciting dining options, look elsewhere.
Just returned from two nights at Treasure Island.  Excellent value for money.  Great location.  Excellent easy access free parking.  Large modern rooms.  I asked for a room on a high level to avoid any noise/smoke issues.  Will return.
Great location, beautiful views from every spot in the room... Free room upgrade which was very nice, can be quite pricey but, your in the middle of the strip
Very disappointed with our recent stay. We are frequent guests at this hotel's stay here several times a year.  The last time we were here we were not charged a resort fee.  Today we went to use our 2 for 1 Buffet but we were advised we needed the coupon we get from check in. The buffet cashier told us to inquire with the front desk.  We go to the front desk the guy said we did not pay a resort fee.  When we checked in the attendant at the front desk told us the resort fee is waived and did not charge us the fee.  The person at the desk told us (in a rude manner) there's a difference between the fee being waived and comped. We told him that we were not given a choice when we checked in the attendant told us the fee will be waived (we assumed they weren't charging it to us since we are frequent guests). Bottom line's attendant was rude.  The front desk was not clear with things.  Very dissatisfied with this last stay. We will not be staying atthis hotel anymore. . . Lastly the valet has been horrible the past 4 days. Is it too much to ask to open the passenger door?  Every hotel we have every been to in Vegas,  the valet attendants have always opened the passengers door.  Mind you the valet wasn't busy during our stay (during the weekdays it's kind of slow... plenty of times we were the only ones waiting in the valet). Last night the valet phone was ringing over 5 minutes and there was no one at the valet desk. . . Do yourself a favor and stay at one of the many other resorts near by.
With TI's renovation, I'd have to say that the stay here was nice.  Our room was clean and equipped with the basics for a Vegas stay (considering you're not spending a lot of time in the room).  The casino itself is decent.  I think the best part of this hotel is the convenient location in the middle of the strip.  And the fact that Starbucks is located inside (but plan on long lines at almost any time of the day).. . Overall if the price is right, I'd stay again.
One of the worst customer service ever received... One of their employees discriminated against us by assuming that we did not speak English. She attempted to request from us to show her our room key in Spanish by saying "Where is the llave." Something that I found extremely disrespectful. We made an attempt to complain to the "supervisor" (Stevenson Graham) but instead he took her side and did not allow her to apologize to us for what she had done. Instead, Mr. Graham forced us out of our room making us leave some of our belongings behind. Worst experience ever at Treasure Island. Never going back to that hotel.
I choose to stay at treasure island because of their good prices and a history of winning in their casino. I didn't have time to gamble this trip so I can't attest if that's true. We arrived around 10:30 to check in and the escalator down to the Lobby from self parking was broken. The elevator was around the corner or you could take stairs. There was no line to check in but the girls working the desk were the most boring, in happy I've ever seen in Vegas. We were informed our reserved king room was not available but we could do two queens and move to the king the next day. We opted to stay in the two queens so we didn't have to repack. After reading the previous reviews of being charged for the room twice I brought cash to pay for the room. The lady asked for the booking card and proceeded to charge the balance due on my card. I stopped her and asked if we could pay cash. She looked at me with attitude sighed and said "you don't want it on the card?" I said no and we finished the transaction she handed us the room keys and didn't tell us about any of the coupons, where room was located or what our room number was. I had to ask her how to get there and she said around the corner.. . Our room was non smoking but you could smell the cigarets first thing walking in. The tv sucked, the iron didn't work, moths were flying in from the air vent but everything else was decent. The in room fridge and safe were nice to have. Upon getting ready the first night my shirt got wet from the countertop and there have been some residual clean agent in the counter and it left a bleach stain on my shirt. . . The crowd in the casino consist of older people, cheap tourist and hookers. The tram to the mirage was broken for our entire stay from Thursday through Monday. Not a big variety of food locations especially for later hours although the 24 Starbucks is nice to have so close.
Legitimately the worst experience I've had in a hotel. I work in customer service, so perhaps having legitimate expectations for how problems are addressed is an issue for Treasure Island. . A smoking room with no alternative? Ridiculous. Our room was booked months ago, specifically designating a nonsmoking room- that's not an acceptable way to conduct check in. The room was disgusting, smelled of weed throughout the night and morning. We were offered an "upgrade" the following day, which is the sole reason we stayed at the hotel. It is the SAME room with the SAME view a few floors higher. The manager at the front desk couldn't have cared less for the fact that I was sick and this experience has been completely unacceptable. After offering the same small room with a different view (which may have made sense in the first place), which I declined because I'm tired of seeing any more mediocrity- the manager waived the resort fee. That's "cool"- but the experience of this weekend has been ruined and the attitude with which she spoke was unacceptable. I hoped the upgrade would've  change our feelings and didn't right a review when we were initially frustrated- but this place deserves no stars at all.
We came to TI for a company party. While we were here we experienced the most rude personal. This was my friend and I first time here. We did the valet parking and asked for help with our bags. The guy who helped us with our bags was ok, not much of a talker. When our bags was loaded on to the cart which mind you we helped with, he all of a sudden became a chaddy Kathy. He proceeded to tell us that he would not be the one taking our bags up and stood there waiting for a tip. We however did not have any cash on us at that time. We felt bad but in return just thanked him for his service. To our surprise he ripped us a new one as we where walking away, he proceeded to say "is there anything else I could help you with! Really! Thanks for your generosity and have a good day!" Everyone standing around just stopped and look. We were so embarrassed. I could not believe what he had done.  I wish I would have gotten his name. Then when we got up to our room and had them bring our luggage up we knew we would encounter the same thing. So we came up with a $2 dollars I mean come on all he's going to do is bring the cart that is already loaded up he elevator. Again we helped unload the bags and handed him the tip. He unravelled the money and smirked. I will never come here again!
This place must be closing. There is No obvious or available management. They are the rude "stodgy" type of staff that you would expect for lack of management.. I've checked into maybe 500 hotels?? At least?? 3 continents. I Never felt such a high amount of tension being a customer checking in between myself and the hotel clerk Chin. This is Vegas! I just got Married yesterday! I even tell that to the clerk. He is unaffected. It's $46 and he wants valid ID and CC! I left my ID in my car, faaaarrrrrr away for self park BTW.. Nonetheless. This is the Walmart of the Vegas Strip. It was a Groupon. I'm learning about Groupon and whhhhhy businesses hire Groupon to promote them. Cause they have POOR hospitality! Poor Service! Room seems clean so far but I paid for a Strip view and got a parking lot. Chin says I can switch rooms Tomorrow, after I've "settled" in. Bottom LineTM Keep your expectations low! . Ps , they charge a Very high "resort" fee, REGARDLESS of the "resort" being closed!! I'll never be here again.. UPDATE: we were given 2 keys and 1 doesn't work. We had a Very far walk to the hotel desk.. Update: I received a message from an employee named Anthony K. of Treasure Island that said and I quote "Clearly given your appearance and the way you conduct yourself, you're white trash. I guess you're too ignorant and stupid to know better. It's times like this where I feel sad because pond scum like you exist; you know that gross-annoying shit you get at the bottom of your shoe? Ya, that's you. Rat-vile.". . I feel this message is perfectly reflective of the service Treasure Island employees provide to their patrons. One day when it closes, we can all read this review and understand why.
I do not expect to be changed for things that were once free . By charging me a fee to watch TV , Internet access, gym thats located on the 3rd floor, a news paper that I need to go pick up at the guest services desk,  local calls from my room,  copies and notary service. By the way all services and taxes can be changed without even letting you know. All at a rate of $28 per night.  Not to mention there is construction going on that makes some areas closed off. Why these new fees ? I wonder when they started this extra fee? My guess is right around the start of construction. I was inconvenience by the construction and really insulted by the surprise fee. Also housekeeping below Standards.  I will not ever come back to treasure island hotel Los Vegas
I stayed here on a Saturday night during NFR. We got here and the valet was "full". I asked if we were actually hotel guests if it was still full and of course they made room for us. Thank you valet guys for not making us carry our luggage too far. :). When we were checking in, the gentlemen that helped us was not friendly. No small talk, welcome to Vegas, etc. Very, heres what your charged, heres your room #, "next!" kind of attitude. I understand that it was late, but we were the only ones in line and they were not busy. Plus, I was invited by the hotel to stay there! . . The room was nice and clean. Three lamps were missing some light bulbs so our room was very dim. Also, two outlets did not work and the Curtain rod was broken so we could not reach to open and close it easily.  . . Side note**They may want to rearrange where they put the beds... I'm sure I'm not the only person woken up by other peoples "night noises" because the headbords from room to room share a wall. . . Overall as a hotel, I have stayed here before and would stay here again. . . I did not gamble much but walking through the casino floor, it did not seem like many people were excited about winning so I am not sure about the gambling. . . We ate at the Coffee Shop/ Pho restaurant, I'll leave a review for that seperate. . . The customer service was the only complaint. They all seemed like they did not want to be there, not a single smile, or warm greeting.
This is a nice place instate of this the room too small and the but tub as well ;( I didn't enjoy as much I expect from Vegas hotels also the gym was close too early so I couldn't go to do my gym time... Anyway it's not the best but it was ok
The stay was ok, the individual checking us in was not very nice.  I have a hearing problem I asked my girlfriend to be my listener and the lady mumbled something it was very apparent she had been beaten up a bit as there was a large line and so I gave her some slack but she was a bit rude and got a little short with us.. The room was nice, the towels were minimal, the people that really drive the hotel, the cleaning crew were awesome and made our stay a great one despite that experience.. This resort fee thing that's popular in Vegas..to use the gym, and internet..well mixed feelings there, however the internet was extremely fast and easy to set up.. . This hotel is in the middle of the strip and a short walk from pretty much everywhere so we had a good few days here without the need of using our car.   . . But I agree with a lot of reviewers on here, the wait staff at the desk it's a sign of management not coaching the staff, not encouraging them to go above and beyond, good things come to people that do their best at their jobs.  They may not think of it as a career option perhaps, but regardless, put in your best effort, you never know who will be on the other side of that counter, imagine "I remember you, you were so nice to me and my wife and still had a smile even after checking what seems like thousands of people", at an interview where you are sweating bullets for a job you really want.. . Management needs to make that one change or take lessons from the cleaning crew who were 100x's nicer, and it would clearly be a 5 star hotel.
This is a pretty crappyand old hotel. The room was dusty and had several missing items such as cups and laundry bags.  The bed sheet was dirty and had a huge bloodstain right in the middle of the bed. I had to ask housekeeping to come and replace the bed sheets.
Fabulous hotel!  Get place to stay.  Clean and comfortable.  If you go next store to the mall there is a food court which is very affordable.  Loved the fact that TI had so many places to eat inside the hotel too.  It's at the end of strip where you don't have alot of beggers.  Casino gives you a couple of buy one free dinners at Buffet.  Plan to stay here again!
Its 3AM in the morning and it took us 4 hours of driving to arrive at this supposedly 4 Stars hotel. Guess what they tell us when we've arrived at Check-In? Sorry our system is down and we can't check you in at this time. Please come back 45 minutes to an hour before the system is backup and running again...Really!!?? This is absolutely unacceptable!!! We are tired and want our room that we'd already paid for. I have the receipt to prove it too. Wish I can give them negative stars....never again will we stay at this hotel again. Everyone, considered this as a warning for you, DON'T COME HERE!!!
Love coming here! I bring the kids here a couple times a year. The prices are good and the rooms are great. The beds are really comfortable. I find it easyto get in and out of the hotel's parking garage as well. I recommend this hotel to families!
Great hotel on the strip! Its just a bit further down from where the main action is but the rates are about half! . . We had a quick and simple check in and since our rooms were all booked we got moved to the 31st floor. The view was amazing. Great time I will definitely come back on my next vegas trip!
Directional signage from the garage to the front desk was so poor (on purpose?) that caused us to traverse the entire smoky casino before we found the check in. Then the front desk told us we had a smoking room - no, we specifically requested a non smoking room. Front desk says there are no non smoking rooms so after a few minutes we were given a non smoking handicap room. Room was small but comfortable. Bathroom quite posh (despite the handicap overhead tracks). An ice chest but not one glass or cup. Smoking allowed everywhere, it smelled like.
Stayed here for 5 days and 4 nights. Upon checking in, I was upgraded to the top floor room with the panoramic view! The view was lovely, especially in the early morning to watch the sunrise. The staff was helpful and friendly:) The casino area was clean and not to crowded, and the buffet (of course) is worth stopping to have dinner at. Only complaint I would have is the prices of non alcoholic drinks and food.. One example: $3 for a small bottle of water!
