Open on a holiday! How very accommodating!. . Pros:. - Waiters were very attentive to our needs! . - Food was amazing! I have never seen mashed potatoes cooked so amazing! MmMmm. - very pretty setting. - steak is cooked a little rarer (if ask for well done, comes out medium well). - wine selection by the bottle is fair. - portion size is really good for single meal! Not too much and not too little... It's perfect!. - sides are generous and made for sharing. . Cons:. - pricy for sure, but it's Vegas!. - not enough wines by the glass.... Would have liked a bigger selection for that. - didn't really see a "stand out" factor
I just finished reading RESTAURANT MAN, by Joe Bastianich.  It explains why he plays rock'n roll at his restaurants.  The book also scared me even further away from looking to open my own restaurant.  Im planning a december trip to vegas to try out B&B Burger.  It will be tough to try a burger place in vegas not named BurGR!
No food does it for me quite like a bone-in ribeye- so when we saw it on the menu- it became a "must order." And clearly this decision was among the best we've made in a town full of...well..let's just say "not so great ones." The waiter instructed us to order it medium, if we normally were medium-rare guys, as they under-cook their steaks and he was right. I've actually never ordered a steak above medium-rare- but this one came out just to my liking. Now- what made this steak perfection was simple- perfect amount of salt, pepper, rosemary to season, which allowed it to be nicely charred and then they drizzle it with great olive oil at the table. WOW is the right word to describe it- as I not only helped finish the steak with my two buddies- but I got the bone and tore it apart (there are pictures to prove that I sat there and ate every piece of steak off the bone like some sort of dog). Ok- my apologies for the novel on just the steak- but I had to share the love I've developed for Vegas via this ribeye. . Other amazing highlights- the bread with the two spreads. The only negative I have about the pork fat spread is just the name- a rebranding of such is in need to soften what sounds like "heart attack in a bowl!" Maybe call it something like- "pork infused butter!". It's quite amazing, especially when you mix it with the normal butter at the table. . For the sides we got a truffle pasta (honestly I don't remember this dish much, as I was in heavenly bliss with my steak while it occupied space on our table), which tasted pretty damn great. We also got the mash potatoes, which I did sample at the end and they were quite epic. We ended dinner with a chocolate and peanut butter torte for my buddy's birthday and that also was fantastic! Just perfect ending to a perfect meal with great friends, food and vino! Mr. Batali- you've outdone yourself again and the name is perfect, as it truly sums it all up!
Great steakhouse. We ordered the bone in ribeye and the lamb chops. Both were excellent. Also had a great Malbec to go with it that our waiter suggested. We also had the beef tartar and beef cheek ravioli as appetizers, and they were phenomenal. All in all a great meal.
I am being generous with two stars. I am here now and it is terrible. The app was not tasty, the "special bread" is dripping I grease and basically flavorless. I did not enjoy the steak ( it was cold) even though very expensive. Please consider another location for your very expensiveve yet mediocre dinner. This is hat makes me feel as if Las Vegas has no good restaurants.. . Ok.  So the main has finally come and I have gone back and changed to a one star.  This place is incredibly expensive  for what you get.  Go pretty much anywhere else.  No kidding.
Most amazing rib eye you will ever have!  This steakhouse is in the Palazzo and I have eaten here twice.  Both times I ordered the dry aged bone-in rib eye ($144).  The beef is massive and cooked to perfection.  Carved table side into thick cuts, stacked into a salivating beef pyramid, drizzled with a tad bit of olive oil (it is an Italian steakhouse after all), and finished off with a dash of coarsely ground sea salt...the best!. . I've also tried the riserva rib eye.  FYI - the riserva is a special line of their beef aged 180-240 days and ordered by the inch ($$$$).  The riserva steaks have a higher concentration of flavor and are more tender due to the aging process.  . . You'll hear that riserva steak has a rich "blue cheese-like" after taste and I definitely would agree with that description of uniqueness to the flavor.  Personally, I preferred their standard 90 day aged rib eye but tasting the riserva was a fine experience I would recommend to anyone to try at least once....when in Rome!
This place is good but for the price you pay for a meal here - there are plenty of better restaurants.  Nothing really stood out to me when it comes to the food.  As Juan Pablo would say "ess okayyyy".
Poor quality. Bad pasta. Would be ok for a $5-10 dish. Do yourself a favor and go to a different place.
Unfortunately, this fancy upscale steak joint is only A-OK for me and here's why:. . - head waiter took a full 5 min explaining the menu, only to have all but disappeared by the time we wanted to order dessert (had to flag down another waiter). . - friends ordered the bone in ribeye, don't know about the marbling but it sure had a lot of fat that needed to be trimmed from it (and this is after the table side cutting/presentation). . - my veal cutlets were pounded nice and thing, but not anywhere as tender as I would have expected. . - was told everything here was cooked a little more rare, which was misleading as my fiancee ordered her filet medium and it came out way overcooked, while my friends' ribeye was ordered med rare and it came out as just that. . On the plus side, the sides were good and the assistant waiter was attentive in keeping our drinks filled. . . At the end of the day though, this was just a bit of a let down by Vegas standards. The food and total experience here isn't any nicer than what I can, and have experienced, in Atlanta.
This was my first time at Carne Vino and It was excellent. The meat was great quality and the side dishes were good. I think I prefer more traditional sides but it was good nonetheless.
First World Problems. **************************. . For me, a weekend getaway to Vegas is not complete without a FAT steak.  I love dry aged steaks and if I am going to pay a premium,  I want it to at least beat the basic chains like Fleming's and Ruth Chris.  The steak was good but it did NOT exceed this basic benchmark unfortunately.  It was just -"OK. " . . The decor and service were outstanding.  But lets talk food.. . I ordered the bone in rib eye for $144 (don't get confused as it says $72 on the menu without clearly stating its per person).  . . Lots of fat on this steak.  And the taste - good but again, not as savory as the basic chain steak houses like Ruth Chris.  . . The sides - brussel sprouts and fried octopus, don't even remember, it was nothing to write about.  . . Bottom line:  group yelp rating gets it about right  at 3-3.5 stars.  Its too expensive for just - "OK."   Overall, a bit disappointed for my weekend-getaway-Vegas-steak experience.
Let me start by saying that I don't typically write bad reviews, so the fact I'm doing so should speak volumes. I'm a Vegas local who frequents the upscale steakhouses in town. CarneVino was far and away the worst of the many I've been to. This bothers me more than usual only because the Palazzo is my favorite property in Vegas.. . I ordered the $144 ribeye and it was incredibly tough. I could barely cut through the meat and obviously had an even harder time chewing. When we brought this to the attention of the server he told us he'd let the chef know. You'd think that if you're dishing out that kind of money on a cut of meat SOMETHING would be done. The resolution was the server saying "Sorry the meat was a little tough for you, hope we'll be able to see you again." Nothing was done or even offered for that matter. I know everyone has an off night, but the fact that nothing was done about my $144 steak makes me not want to give them the benefit of the doubt.. . Furthermore, for a restaurant of this magnitude you'd expect the service to be outstanding. I will say that the man who refilled the water and carved our steak, Carl, was fantastic. However, our main server straight down to the hostess was rude and rarely came by the table to check on us.. . There are far better places in Vegas to spend your money on a nice meal - including in the Palazzo and Venetian (CUT by Wolfgang Puck is in the same hotel and far better). Save your money and skip this place.
Do not eat here.  I took my family to CarneVino for a Christmas Dinner and the food was terrible.  Small portions for the price and just lousy food.  We had two orders of the aged ribeye and a few pasta dishes. The steak was over-cooked, fatty and tasted gamy.  The pasta was basically a bunch of mushrooms with a few noodles that tasted like it was re-heated.  When I asked to speak to a manager about the food, Valerie said there are no managers to speak to until next week because he's on vacation. We didn't finish our meal it was so bad and the manager never returned my call.  If you want a good steak, go to Wolfgang Puck; we had a good meal/steak dinner there. Also, Samba Sushi in the Palazzo is excellent!
A party of 7 dined here this past Friday. First the good; beautifully decorated dining room, excellent service. We had been so looking forward to the finest steak we had ever had. To quote one of the dinner guests; "it was a swing and a miss". We had the 2 featured steaks, rib eye for 2 and the porterhouse for. 2. Both were very disappointing.   The taste was simply not great and not up the taste standards of either SW Wynn or Del Friscos. And the prices were considerably higher. Save alot of disappointment and money and go elsewhere.
I bought my parents a Carnevino gift card worth $200 for their 40th anniversary in December. I made a reservation for my parents and confirmed with two hostesses that  about the special occasion of the evening. Both hostesses said they made a note of their anniversary and would do something special for dessert to commemorate their anniversary. One even said that upon arrival, there would be something special done for them upon arrival. After my parent's meal there, my mom mentioned that nothing AT ALL was done in commemoration of their special evening. My parents ordered a gelato for dessert, and NO MENTION or commemoration of their anniversary at all. If I had known that their staff were dishonest, I would have purchased them a gift card at one of the top notch restauarants at neighboring Wynn hotel, where I was promised something much more special for their anniversary celebration. Definitely would not dine here again given their lack of honesty. I even spoke to the General Manager, who only offered a verbal apology and said I hoped I would dine with them again. No gift card or anything to make up for the dishonest experience. A 40th anniversary is a once in a lifetime event!
(Our group's reservation was made a comfortable two days before our visit) . The evening was already soured when our hostess rudely broke her centimeter-thick temper. Our group of five asked to be seated in the main restaurant, and not the small, triangle room completely separated and across the hotel hallway. The hostess then told us that they only have two tables in the entire restaurant that can accommodate 5 people. We were then seated in "the wine cellar" beneath the hotel escalators. First encounter with a restaurant should not be a poor mannered hostess. Ambience was off putting as music choice was loud and inappropriate for an Italian steakhouse that only offers very few bottles of red wine under $200. . . However-. . Our waiter and sommelier were very kind and very knowledgable of the menu and wine list. Major props to them- when asked about wine pairings for a crab and white truffle sformato, they were able to offer great, educated choices (we ended up pairing the dish with a heavy Chardonnay which, though wildly overpriced, worked well). Other notes on the food:. . (Everything was overpriced- so I won't mention it in every description). . Porterhouse Steak (MR): not sure what happened here, the cut more resembled venison as it tasted unusually gamy. . . Filet Mignon (MR): my order- very tasty, great portion, well cooked, and cut like butter. . . . Beet Carpaccio: lots of flavors, fun presentation, very light, very small portion. . . Pastas: we ordered two pastas which were both relatively underwhelming, though very fresh- mostly poor meal pairing on our part I suppose?. . Desserts: light and tasty, no flavor complaints.. . In general- everything was very harsh on the palate, which made building our meal in three-course form, as the restaurant suggested, difficult. There were some pleasant notes in the evening, but overall we were underwhelmed and unimpressed.
