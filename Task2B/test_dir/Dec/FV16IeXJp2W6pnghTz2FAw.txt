Service was great for me but I was turned off by a piece of cubed fat i found in the pho. I'm guessing they use it for flavor. Little more expensive than other nearby places that are open late as well and equally if not more tasty. Also has smelled a bit funny in there when I take-out latenight boba (not the typical pho joint smell). Atmosphere is nicer than the majority of pho places in town. Kind of hip, swanky, dim lighting. Good for a date.
Bad service, dirty, not good food!
I really need to get out and explore Chinatown a bit more! This 24 hour restaurant is a pretty good place to get a meal after a night out on the town. At 2am, it was busy!  My plan was to get some pho, but I ended up getting something else. I can't even remember the name of it, but it had noodles, salad greens, small egg rolls, and shrimp in it. It was okay, not fantastic- but a lot of sauce helped add some flavor. The service was pretty speedy, and the prices reasonable. The portion was pretty large as well.. . Decent food for soaking up the alcohol, and available whenever the mood strikes you!
This was the only Pho location open 24/7, located conveniantly in Chinatown.. . Maybe it was the odd hour I stopped by, (Around 5-6am?), but the food wasn't spectacular or something to scream about.. . I've passed by this location a few times, and always wondered why the interior/workers were very formal - then I found out it was to perhaps make up for the lack of good food.. . Ordered the meatball pho, portion was pretty small. The weather here is FREEZING, and a nice hot bowl of pho is usually the cure! . But this bowl was lukewarm.. The meatballs tasted rubbery and artificial. I left
It's been over three years since I first reviewed Pho Kim Long.  They have gotten a little too popular for their own good. They're open 24/7 now and the consistency isn't what it once was unfortunately. . . The one thing I think they still do here better than most is their Chicken Pho. Since chicken pho isn't all that popular most places simply have it as an after-thought. At PKL it is done well with a very good broth.. . They must be doing something right to always be as busy as they are, but unless it 3am and you just got out of the club, I still think there are better options in the vicinity.
Honestly, I don't understand the hype of this place or the giant lines.  Yes, the place is very pretty and absolutely the service is very good, but the food?  Meh.  The first time I went there was a couple of years ago for lunch and it was very good - delicious pho.  Went for dinner with a bunch of friends more recently and the quality was just not there.   I thought it was just okay.  Pho wasn't entirely hot when I got it, which was disappointing. As others have mentioned, some foods taste like they were bought pre-packaged and not made in house. One of my companions is Vietnamese and came from a family of caterers, to boot.  He ripped the place a new one over the food - spices were off, dishes were not done properly, etc.  I was genuinely disappointed as I love all kinds of Asian food and wanted to really like this place.  Unfortunately, I think they've gotten a little big for their britches, they know folks are going to show up no matter what and just are phoning it in now. . . Now when I want pho I go down a few doors to Fat Dumpling - great pho with all fresh ingredients, no ridiculously long lines, and better price.
We have eaten here 3 times and while the food is good the service really isn't. Our last visit was the worst: no drink refills, we had to track someone down for our check, and this was at 2:30 in the afternoon so they weren't even busy. Previous times weren't quite as bad but they also weren't good.
Best Pho in town. If I am hungry anytime of the night I always can count on Pho Kim Long.
The atmosphere was nice and the food was decent. The service was just okay maybe because they were a little bit busy. Not sure if I will return.
Went today after I got off work because I wanted some pho, which I haven't had in a very long time. Was super disappointed in how much it has changed. We waited for our server to come which was about 20 minutes, to be rushed with our order to receiving the food, which was average, to waiting for the server to come back over so I could order to go. The server again rushed my order and was more worried about making sure the check was signed. I was disappointed in everything. I ended up receiving my to go order and left because I was disgusted about the way everything was. I get home to find out they screwed my to go order up....besides the horrible service, the decor was okay, they should get remodeled due to the scuffed tables, walls and chairs to the chairs cushions being torn, the bathrooms being utterly disgusting and to the fish tanks that have maybe 1-2 fish max in there. It's gone downhill, and I used to recommend this place to everyone.
Pho is alright, broth is hot, sliced beef are very good and rare, but can't compare to anything from NorCal or SoCal. 24/7 hours is good for the late night partiers in Vegas, and near by themain strip. Ambience and interior is nice.. . As typical with most Asian places, service was subpar. Not even a single hot water refill, even after paying a buck for tea.. . Do NOT order the spicy salt fried calamari; crazy over salted, I barely ate 2 bites.. . Not good, not bad pho, doubt I'll come back again.
Pho is acceptable BUT service is the pits! VEEY RUDE SERVERS and CASHIER! They gave us the impression of hurry and eat and get out of here!
Two words: HELLA GOOD. Wish we had one of these in Oregon! Visited in October while on a business trip. So glad we chose this place over the pho place a few doors down. Nothing against the one a few doors down, I have never been there but EVERYTHING about our experience at Pho Kim Long was awesome. We chose this place over the other solely because the name was too awesome to pass up and I couldn't resist a check-in on Facebook.. . Everything from our appetizer to the dessert was amazing. We started with the Calamari which my mouth is watering for as I write this review two months later. Very salty but nothing wrong with that! Next up for me was the pho which is hard to screw up but surprisingly some places in Oregon do. It was spot on- perfect flavor. For dessert we had the pineapple half with ice cream. The ice cream could have been served a little but it was still great.. . To top it all off our server was one of the most friendly servers I've had. I believe he said it was only his second day working there. He did an outstanding job and was very personable. The whole family left very satisfied!
Been coming here for close to give or take 7 years. . . Really good pho! I usually like to do either the rare beef with brisket or flank and the spring rolls. . . Salt and pepper chicken wings are great! (The jalapeno is the pepper). . BBQ pork appetizer is great as well. . . If your feeling authentic try the braised catfish clay pot it is excellently full of flavor!. . The service is very fast unless you come during their peak times then you might wait just a little longer. . . Definitely one of my favorite pho spots in Vegas!
This place deserve 5 stars. Service was good, clean and most important the pho was good. Tasty soup base; not salty. And generous portion.
The Chinese broccoli was the best dish we had there, but steep at 11 dollars a plate.  Just your average Vietnamese place with poor service.
Awesome food STELLAR service! Don't be intimidated by the long line. They service you rather quickly but still are super attentive. Such a gem right off the strip! Worth the short drive down!!  Ohh and try everything!! Large party of 12 and EVERYTHING was exceptional! 5 Stars!!!
This place hands down is the worst. The food is Mediocre it's not even worth the wait. We came in at 12:30 and didn't get seated until 1:15. And we waited another 20 mins for our order to be taken. We came in with a large group and even after waiting an hour we didn't get to sit together cause I guess It's too difficult to push tables together. And they were so pushy about separating us from each other. Everyone who works here looks so miserable while they're working like they hate their life. The service here is so rude that it just ruins the meal for you. Also the tables who were sat after us received their food and water way after us. Pho Kim Long is so dysfunctional, unorganized, and has one of the work customer service I have ever received. I'm sure there are other pho places in Vegas that are way better than this.
When you're drunk, after a night out, a bowl of pho here will taste like a 5 star.  But when you come here, sober, do you start to have better judgement and assessment of their service and quality - hence, my 3 stars.. . Coming here for lunch on a sober morning, we were seated at a reasonable time and given a menu to browse.  Right after that, the experience went downhill from there.  It took almost 10 minutes before anyone came to our table to take our order.  Once our order was placed, it didn't take as long for our food to arrive.. . We ordered their bun bo hue and pho combination. Broth for both was simply salty.  Their bun bo hue was nothing I would have expected from what should be a spicy flavorful broth, it was rather plain and simply salty.. . I left with excessive sodium intake and needed H2O to normalize.  Perhaps it is the salty hot broth that when intoxicated hits the spot, but when awake and alert... it is a different experience.
I have been here once early this year, went there around 9pm and everything was ok...I am not a Pho expert but I liked it at the time. This time I figure I invite out of town guests at around 0230 in the morning Monday December 22nd 2014.....The initial waitress did not say a single word to us in the 4 times she went to our table and took a little over 10 minutes to make first contact. The Male waiter was short and unfriendly too, got our order and disappeared , forgot the spoons. . . The food was ok but ruined by RUDE service and the following: My guest (which happens to run a million dollar restaurant)  requested carbonated water from the soda tap (gas bubbles and water).... when we got the bill they charged it as a full flavored soda . . 3 dollars for carbonated water! . we questioned it since nowhere else in AMERICA they charge for Co2 and water, they went to get the manager (which claimed to be the owner). That younger male with an attitude of a major jerk, leaned on the table with both "fists" on the table, leaned over into our personal space and asked: whats your problem! . . The question of why in the name of everything that is 100% free anywhere in America he was charging 3 dollars for carbonated water and with a major attitude and tone of voice he said: . . "I don't care if I lose a customer that doesn't want to pay for carbonated water, Its 2.99 and I will not remove it from the bill" .. . Needless to say the rude waiters did not get tip and I will never go back and I will never suggest this hole again.  I am sure that punk is the SON of the hard working parents who most likely slave all morning and afternoon to get this restaurant running..... If you look at the reviews, most of the lesser stars are because the graveyard staff attitude.
Now I understand they're voted the best in Vegas, food isalways good. Service is great. And the reason why Pho Kim Long is getting five stars from me is, I accidentally ordered the wrong thing and they happily replaced it with no problem
The best thing about this place is that it's 24 hours. Cost about $9 for a small bowl, a dollar and some change more than what's around. Which wouldn't be a problem if it tasted better. Mediocre pho to say the least. Not the worst I've had though. It's just eh.
I was serious dissapointed when I asked the waitress what kind of Pho they serve in here? Is it the North version or South version, and he hesitated reply me: Chinese Pho version :/ I was completely speechless. Pho is not even from China. I ordered Bun Bo Hue, it taste kinda ok, but very greasy. The noodle is not the right kind for bun bo hue, it was too thin. Services is alright, but I would recommend Pho in here
Every time I've been here the food has been great. That said tonight I experienced terrible service and want to make sure people watch for it. Our server was fine but her manager Lam (or Lamb?) was a nasty person. I heard him speak so negative to our server using profanity for something that was his fault. A customer should never hear that nor should an employee be crying because of bad management. I hope the establishment takes note because we go there often in large groups but it's not worth someone suffering  over. I hope this guy gets what he deserves. As a business owner I can say he would have been let go a long time ago for his attitude and bad work ethic.
OMG, the girl named Hana(/Hanna?)was so rude. I never met any waitress that ruder than her. this was my first time to this restaurant but I was extremely upset due to this discourteous behavior. the food was ok, not the best Vietnamese dishes in town. Never come back unless they fire the girl.
Racists!  I've been treated poorly by Asians before, but this place takes the cake.  My friend and I were seated and ignored.  A pair of Asian men sat at the table next to us ten minutes later and so the waiter HAD to show up.  Of course he took their order first and our food made it out eventually.  I paid with my credit card and went out to my car where I was chased down by the manager who asked me if I had paid!  Evidently the "waiter" was quick to our table only if it meant money in his pocket.  Hateful racists.  Is all of Chinatown harboring such hatred?
Was not impressed. Confused why there is a wait and the place seems to be popular. It was dirty, service was impersonal and the food was second rate at best. The shrimp was undercooked in both the appetizer and entree that we ordered. The sauce for our fried calamari was right out of a can. We tried two appetizers, four dishes including pho which was watered down and under seasoned. There is no love in this food.
Really yummy but don't expect authentic vietnamese a bit thrown by the Thai and chinese dishes too
I don't like being negative, but I don't mind telling the truth. The most mediocre Pho I've ever had. And some of the crappiest service around...unless you're asian. . . I absolutely dislike saying this, but it was so clearly apparent. Our waiter was a jerk! In the entire restaurant, there was only our table and one other table that wasn't asian. Both tables were neglected and weren't even given chopsticks. Come on!!! White people can't use chopsticks? . . Our waiter also forgot my sister in laws noodles and two beverages. How do you just forget an order that you wrote down? . . And my Beef Pho wasn't very flavorful and the beef was nearly inedible. It was so fatty and chewy. But, it was inexpensive. $7-something and came with add-ins. Like jalapenos, basil and mung beans. There's also house made sauces and spicy pepper sauces like Sriracha. . . And I guess you need to go stupid early, because A) Parking is a Nightmare and B) there's a 6 p.m. dinner rush which means you will be smushed in the doorway with a bunch of grumpy people for an hour. . . It's also open 24 hours and located within Las Vegas's China Town. . . All in all...I'm not recommending this place if you want good Pho or if you're not asian? I totally don't understand the reviews. Because apparently the clueless white folks are getting the crappy scraps or something.
Things have changed......came back for the calamari  and the filet mignon pho'....... service was terrible! . The waiters acted as if we were annoying them or something...like waiting on us was a  waist of their time? . The food came out quickly, but had to wrestle up a waiter for drink refill, and when refilling my son's sprite... they poured water in his soda and walked off like nothing had happened.. The quality of the Pho' isn't what past experiences has brought me to remember...not even close to the amount of noodles they used to give and the broth was mediocre at best....... I was sooooo looking forward to my old Pho Kim Long, and this wasn't it!!
Cold soup and noodles for pho ha ( Chicken Noodle Soup) plus the egg rolls gave after the payment waiting too long for this food never happen like this before in the past I'm sad and disappointed
There is more truth in these reviews for this restaurant than any other restaurant I've read upon on yelp that I've visited. Ive been many times and my experiences range from awful, to mediocre, to fantastic.  Pricing is really not that bad. .      Service ranges just like the food...sometimes its terrible, and sometimes its great. I do agree with a few of the other posters in regards to asian customers seem to get better treatment and food. And i say this with the most confidence and its my friends family who owns the place and I've been with there, with her, and other family members, and we got NO discount or any other special treatment.  . . Also, this place plays no games. I've seen many people kicked out of the restaurant. You too drunk? Goodbye! Your too loud? Goodbye! Rude? Sleeping at table? Taking forever to eat? Goodbye! . . .      Parking sucks and the place stays busy. 24 hour restaurant. Some of the best Pho I've had has been here as well as some of the worst. . .      I'd highly recommend this place when all is said and done. Its hard to beat a place that is close to the strip, thats 24 hours. If you 10 times, you will enjoy at least 5 of those trips....but thats expected at places like this that stay this busy all the time.
Best pho in Vegas but the service is slow and horrible. If you're that busy, hire more damn employees.
if I could give a 0 star I would ! service was bad food was bad. we ordered just a basic pho with brisket we asked for extra hot broth and they said they can't do it, and then when we finally got our food the broth was lukewarm.  it took forever for them to bring out water, they threw down the bowls, it was waste of money and tip. we will never go there again.
The food here is pretty tasty for the first couple of bites but it gets to you after and get sickening to eat. My pan fried noodles were a bit salty. The service is pretty quick here though. Right after we ordered the food literally came out within a few minutes but they can be a little rude handling your food. One server didn't really tell us which noodle it was and kind of expected us to know whose bowl is whose. But at least it opens 24 hours!
