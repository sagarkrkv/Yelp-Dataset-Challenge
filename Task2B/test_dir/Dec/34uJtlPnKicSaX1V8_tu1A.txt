If you're going to go to Vegas make sure you walk through the Venetian Hotel;  its a beautiful hotel.  There are lots of areas that are real works of art!  I know some people made consider this place as ostentatious or over the top, but consider this is what Vegas is all about!  Vegas is a simple statement of the basic law of Economics: it's the first thing you learn in Econ 100... man's wants is unlimited!  . . Ok I like the Venetian Hotel.  My friend and I were able to snag a suite on the 27th floor with a view of the strip.  I have to admit we didn't stay in the room much.  We were too busy golfing or dining to really enjoy the hotel and the suite.  Oh the excesses of money....  Haha!!!
Gone downhill over the past several years.  . . The ventilation is terrible.  Nonsmoking rooms smell of smoke. A coworker mentioned the "scent" they spray in the casino to cover any odors there reminds her of the lady's room. I realize for some that could, perhaps, be a bonus and I'll try not to judge. . . I've tried several restaurants and they are mediocre at best. . . The last straw was after paying hundreds per night plus an additional Resort Fee I get internet service that is useless.
While The Venetian in Las Vegas is nowhere near as grand as the real thing in Italy, it does offer a taste of Europe, but minus the pick pockets.. . I've stayed here a couple times and since it's an all-suite hotel, all rooms are spacious, complete with a separate couch space for watching TV, or staring blankly at a wall while fantasizing about winning the Megabucks jackpot. It may not be as modern as the City Center hotels, but you'll be more than satisfied with the amenities and shops.
After years of staying in Vegas in "non-luxury" hotels we finally decided it was time to splurge. A bit pricey even in off season but was well worth it.. Husband and I wanted a nice hotel with all the perks. We don't gamble but love dining and just the relaxation of a nice room we can kick up our feet in at the end of the day. Are we the norm for Vegas? No....we enjoy getting to the room early evening and watching in room movies, snacking and just kicking back. Nothing like getting away from the busy life of work and kids. We live close enough and this was our third time this year. . . A nice thing about going this year was the weather. We've always gone when temps reached triple digits so this was a nice change of pace. . . Our room was amazing. It did feel like luxury. It was clean, had a mini bar (over priced but with a Walgreens right outside the Hotel-we didn't get into it) THREE TV's....one in the bedroom (Big one) one in the sitting room (where we watched The Equalizer before dinner)and in the bathroom. Who watches in the bathroom? They always have free wifi that connected fast and great service. We even opted for Valet parking this time. Never did that before. Yes, it was a special trip. . . We walked around the whole hotel and the Grand Canal Shoppes. Or should I say window shopped. Although the hotel is a wonderful stay....shopping here was way over my budget. I don't make it a habit of shopping in Vegas. . . Would I stay here again? As much as I would love to....we're just blue collar workers. I will stick to what we know and are comfortable with, besides we typically see shows while there and I would rather spend my disposable income on Penn & Teller and such.. . If you have never splurged on yourself in Vegas this is the place to do it. I felt like a Queen for the weekend.
Was there on a recent vacation. It is by far the best luxury resort in vegas hands down.... . Visited all the resorts on the strip. Nothing comes close not even the Wynn or the Mandarin or the Bellagio. . . The staff is amazing. Truly the most enriching experience.. . From Decor, Suite comfort levels, service and food.... . The best
My family has been a fan of staying at the Palazzo. We love the convenient of self park parking structure that we never have to wait for our car. The hotel itself is always clean and we almost get the best view and the room. Most of the time we get free upgrade because we come here so often. Love the front desk and checking in is always fast. Love this place!
What a phenomenal stay!. . The cab ride from airport to Hotel was great, once we arrived we were greeted by the door staff which were nice to recommend to always pay cash to cab drivers because it's cheaper and they don't get all tips if you use a CC. Once at front desk, young man called Mayool checked us in with no problems, we did arrive very late after midnight so we had to check in to a smoking room, we are not smokers and Mayool just wanted us to try it out because it had a phenomenal view up high, just for the night and have us move the next two days, we had no problem with it because the room was not in bad condition nor too smelly and it was an amazing view. Next day we moved to a none smoking room which Mayool nicely had blocked for us and which we are thankful for.. . Next day we did lots of shopping and entertainment so we just wanted to relax and watch a movie, our movies in room were having a little issue so I called the front desk and a girl by the name Jennifer was incredible pleasant, she has the nicest voice and very helpful attitude, she called maintenance for us because it was in issue she couldn't resolve on her end.. . No later than 10 min, a gentlemen by the name of Brian from maintenance came to room and did some magic, my movies were fixed in less than 5 min.. . The next morning we decided to use the Gym, all good equipment. After that we headed to Canyon Ranch cafe where a very cheerful Joe Arroyo, recommended what could possibly be one of the best smoothies I've ever had in my life (Banana, mango, peach and whey protein) nothing special but I wouldn't have come up with that combination and I love when people recommend something when I don't really know what to get.. . That same day we took the famous Gondola ride, needless to say, its mind blowing, an incredible experience and one of the most romantic moments we spent at the hotel.. . To finalize our wonderful stay, the next day we had a delightful brunch at an Italian Bistro, not sure the name of it but I believe it was Zeffirinos? The place is a beautiful little spot with patio that every single person was taking pictures in. A wonderful British woman by name of Alethea was our server, who wouldn't enjoy the services of a British accent person!? Truly, it just made me feel like I was in Europe.. . Overall it was a Phenomenal trip to Vegas and I wanted to take the time to thank all the staff for the wonderful services and I'm sure all other departments that I didn't mention, do a terrific Job as well.. . Thank you, because of you is that we shall return.. . Mayool FD. . Jennifer FD. . Brian Maintenance. . Joe Arroyo F&B Canyon Ranch Cafe. . Alethea F&B Zefferinos. . Emily F&B Buddy V's
You know this saying "you get what you pay for" well The venetian fits that saying. Very beautiful resort, not liking the resort fee so I called everyday for things I didn't need toothpaste and mouthwash, I bring my own but $25 a day... I have to get even some way. The rooms are very big & comes with a living room & 3 TV's, one of the TV's is in the bathroom. The bed is extremely comfortable & it's very quite. After a hardcore night of partying, you will get a great night or day rest here. Worth the money.
I fell in front of the Venetian on slippery cement. Security asked if I wanted an EMT, I said no. But after a few days my tail bone was killing me so I called Venetian and they said sorry, because I waited they wouldn't help pay for my care. I am a senior and they dismissed me. I will never take anymore of my company to Venetian. VENETIAN DOESN'T CARE ABOUT SENIORS!!!!! It was their liability and they wouldn't accept it although I had alot of witnesses.
I have to say that employee The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino always goes out of her way to help me every morning in the hospitality suite. She always has a smile and keeps everything clean, organized and fully stocked. She even goes out of her way to get a special order item if needed. I look forward to seeing her on my visits.
Pros: Nice hotel overall.. Cons: 1.They charge a daily resort fee of $25.00 per night that gets you free wifi, a coffee and newspaper...that should be an option not a must. $125 of internet for a 5 day stay is ridiculous, I never read the newspaper...Pfff.. 2. They have a mini fridge in the suite filled with drinks...if you dare to even move one (even if you dont drink it) you get charged for it!! Who the hell puts mini fridges in a suite with $10 drinks (as a tramp I see it)..Ridiculous....those fridges should have 2 bottles of water and be empty for whatever the heck you wanna put em.... . 3. First hotel I ever stay in that doesnt even offer a courtesy bottle of water, yes there are a few bottles of water in the room when you arrive, but the same system as that fridge... drink one of those waters and you will be charged $8.00!!. 4. The beds are rock hard.. 5. They dont have fitted sheets on the mattress which makes it kind of nasty.... 6. The hotel is a maze...you spend a lot of time trying to get around, signs are not designed in a readable manner..just looking at them gave me a headache.. 7. A lot of employees dont even know their way around...imagine us guets...PFF!.  Items #1,2 and 3 really pissed me off about this hotel, will never stay here again..
The decorations indeed beautiful, but the staff are not so friendly as in Aria. I wait at the Bouchon for more than 5 minutes and nobody ever care about me. As for the room service, we have asked for it and the front desk said it would be served in 15 minutes. However the room staff arrived after 30 minutes! I asked for the kettle on my first day in Venetian, and I had to make two phone calls to get me kettle be sent to my room. The first lady on the phone only told me that the kettle was not available and I asked her please sent it to me asap if it could be available again. However, she totally forgot about this thing at all. Those things really made me disappointed, especially on the Xmas Day.  One star for Venetian.
The rooms are big and clean. Just like other five stars hotels in the area, plenty of restaurants onsite.
We came to ride the gondolas, 4 of us. We were interested in riding the outside ones, so we asked an employee who was there greeting us as we walked in where we could purchase them. He directed us to a desk with 2 guys, who said they could sell them to us. . Come to find out he was just trying to sell us show tickets and wasted an hour of our time. Once he realized we weren't  buying any show tickets, he told us where we could buy them. He also told us my daughter  was too young to ride, she is 2.5. Once we got outside, they said she could and we couldve bought the tickets out there in the 1st place. So we get on and the ride was nice, too short though. Same price as 1 of the pictures they try to sell you at the end. Then as we were about dock, our boatman mentions that tips are greatly appreciated.  I was going to tip, but felt kind of odd being asked to tip. I still did, but felt weird afterwards. Never again. Plus too, there is no buffet here, and if there is I couldnt find it. Felt like I was at a car lot and just got suckered. Employees here just felt too pushy, like those people in the mall. And they didn't have their information right. Nice hotel, but the customer service is terrible!
pros: location and the in-hotel casino, restaurant and ambiance overall/ beautiful room. cons: not great service but vallet and front desk/ no late check out option/ very busy parking/ we were on the 33th floor (almost on top) and the wind sound woke us up couple of times during night. There was sth wrong with the insulation I believe.. I am comparing this hotel with Wynn and Encore. overall good but not up to par with those two.
3 Days of great experience!!!. Amazing Suit ( we got the Prima), Great service, Great room service (The food ),. Everything was fast and easy.. Thank you so much Venetian Hotel.
nice hotel and Casino. unfortunately our room was 2 football fields and 2 elevator rides from any entrance or exit. it was excessive.
Went here on Christmas day, it was very busy. Check in staff was very friendly & helpful. The line went by quick. We got two rooms, the guy made sure we were on the same floor. The room was beautiful, like a little suite! Everything worked perfect, room was clean & the bed was comfortable. Looks like rooms are the same except you just pay for a view. I would've gave them 5 stars but at 9AM housekeeping comes knocks on door & walks away, comes back 30 mins later & tries to open the door! She does this just to wake you up so she can start cleaning. So annoying! Check out is at 11AM!! Let people sleep!!. . Also enjoyed the lux cafe & the casnio level food court. Staff there were also very kind. Food was alright but a bit pricey but it is Vegas... Lol
What a trip!  There is nothing like the Venetian. From the accordion player in the entry to the gorgeous painted ceilings. Rooms are very nice and comfortable and I love that they have robes and a "makeup station" in the bathroom. We ate at the Italian restaurant overlooking the canal and it was one of my favorite dining experiences ever. I also had a late night burger from the food court and it was awesome!  Gambling was fun and the dealers seemed patient. Don't expect complimentary coffee in your room or a fridge.... Everything has an up charge, I mean everything. It was in the center of everything.
All the rooms are suits so that gives you a lot of extra space. The bathroom is luxurious and they try really hard to be one of the nicest hotels in Vegas. I would rate them in the top 4. The nightclubs are great as are the restaurants in both the Palazzo and the Venetian. Service was good and I would definitely stay here again.
