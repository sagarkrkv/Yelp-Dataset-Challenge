We stumbled upon this place while wondering around the strip and to my surprise the place was really nice and it had a very fun atmosphere. . . My friends and I decided to grab something "light" but had no idea the portions were going to be so huge. . . I ordered the mozzarella cheese hamburger. The burger was really big and I also got the side of fries. The patty was very juicy and the temperature was perfect not too hot not too cold.  :) The cheese was perfectly melted on the patty. The sad part was.... THEY HAVE NO RANCH ... they had no RANCH!!!! :( I wanted to dip the fries in ranch !!! GAHHH hahah they gave me cucumber ranch?... which wasn't so bad but... didn't beat ranch.. . My friend ordered the smoked Applewood bacon hamburger I was too full to try hers but looked heavenly with the bacon in between the patty and the bun! She also ordered the tangerine mimosa but..that was definitely not a good choice.... . Other buddy of mine decided to order the sage fried chicken benedict. The presentation of the dish is very unappealing but the taste is the total opposite of what It looks like. There's so many flavors in one bite but it's complimentary with each other! . . Definitely a place to try when you're in the area and for the portion the price isn't so bad ! :) we actually took the left over back to the room and was enough to feed two people.
The late night service I'm receiving is nothing short of lazy and inconvenienced. The staff is impatient and static at best. Ordering food is a burden. If there were someplace better like. Denny's is more attractive than here. The night menu is limited and lazy. Wow. For all the praise this place gets I expect more. So not impressed. Bar staff is functional at best. She opens her own drink first rather than getting you a drink. Not impressive at all. Asked me if I wanted to order. I did. Then she didn't enter it in. Only asking me again what I ordered 5 minutes later. Not my favorite place period.
Seriously The Best Breakfast in Vegas!! I'm in love with Hash House!! Their hash scrambles and Bloody Mary's are to die for!! . Love, love this place!'
We were checking out the new O'Shea's Casino next to The Quad casino and decided to grab a little grub. We took the escalator up and came up to an empty hostess stand, but she came back pretty quickly and seated us right away. The waitress came over shortly thereafter and we were off and running. I ordered the corned beef hash with two eggs over easy. The potato cubes arrived super crispy, which I love. The hash was fresh and tasty and had some swiss cheese running throughout.  It also came with a nice slice of watermelon.  The corned beef is more of a shredded style of hash. I'm a fan and I'll definitely be back for more.
Food is great here, with large portion sizes and flavors galore.. . Love the bloody mary bar at the entrance. Great way to pass time when you're waiting. And not to mention they're "bloody" good!. . We only had about a 20 minute wait, but our kids were a little fussy. The bar was nice enough to give us a few slices of fruit (watermelon slices and orange slices) to distract them. Just perfect.. . The only downside for me was the volume of the music. It seemed really loud, making it difficulty to talk. Good to drowning out kid noice, but a little overwhelming too with everything else going around (televisions, hustle/bustle). I think taking it down a notch would make it perfect!
You shall find this amazing breakfast/brunch restaurant inside the Quad Resort & Casino.. . Came here during early Saturday morning and there was no line at all. Service was top notch - probably the best service I've ever had for a breakfast place. . . Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles (two chicken breasts w/ hardwood smoked bacon, waffle tower, hot maple reduction, fried leek - $16.95, New York Times Favorite) - First of all, I was completely astonished by the decoration. It was such a simple piece of art - fried leek stick on top of fried chicken. Honestly, fried chicken wasn't mind-blowing (not super juicy, but not horrible either). The bacon-infused waffle was interesting, but wasn't as fluffy and great tasting as I thought. Nonetheless, fired leek was pretty good! . . In terms of taste, I would probably give 3.5-stars. However, its amazing / friendly service, huge portion of food, and beautiful decoration (the "surprise" factor) definitely enhanced my overall dining experience. I am more than happy to come back here and something different next time.
Hungry? Well this place have delicious food and huge portions!! The atmosphere is great and everyone is nice I would definitely come back when I visit Vegas.
A must-have if you're on the Las Vegas Strip.  They do get busy.  Luckily, it wasn't too busy when we got there...around 11:00am.  They said it was a 30min wait, but we only waited like 10min.  Get the Chicken and Waffles.  The serving is enough for 2 people unless you're really hungry.  Their stuffed burgers are big...two burger patties.  We also  ordered their Corn Beef and it was good.  It had good flavors.  We will definitely return.
It was my first time eating at Hash House at this location. Everything was great. Our waitress Bri was attentive and friendly. Our drinks were always full and the food came out in a timely manner. There was five of us for a Bachelorette brunch and I expected it would take a lot longer for the food but we waited no more than 20 minutes. I ordered the French Toast and it tasted amazing! Another great thing about this location is that they're open 24 hours. I will be coming back. Great food with great service.
We arrived at 8:00am and got a table right away.  The term 'hash' is somewhat misleading here (at least in my book).  The meats are chopped or shredded up and then served over a bed of crispy potatoes and topped with eggs.  It's not your typical hash that most of us are familiar with.  Prices a bit higher than most breakfast joints, but the portions are very generous.  Hubby went with the corned beef hash and I ordered the egg whites scrambled with smoked salmon and onions (plus 'tons of fruit').  The corned beef hash was tasty and lots of it.  Hubby managed to plow through about half before tossing in the towel.  I only got through a third of my scrambled egg whites before getting full.. . Now, the really excellent item was the single, house-made biscuit that came with Hubby's breakfast.  It was flaky, buttery, and just darn delicious - especially with house made jam.  . . We just couldn't finish, so had them box it all up with every intent of taking it back to our time-share and heating it up for breakfast the next day (forgetting, of course, that we already had reservations for brunch).  Ended up giving it to a homeless gentleman that was rummaging through the trash pulling out partially eaten McDonald fries.  Hopefully, he enjoyed it as much as we did.
Stop with the Christmas treein the chicken and waffles please. Kept it simple.
I cannot say how impressed I was with this place.  First of all there was no wait which was already a good sign (or because it was 9am and most of the folks that went out the night before just went to bed an hour before that)...we get seated and about 3 minutes later, our server greets us.  Nicest guy ever.  Customer service is huge for me.  My cousin told him it was my birthday and he told me happy birthday and offered me a complimentary shot of whatever I wanted.  I'm sold! I ordered the chicken and waffles and OH.EM.GEE!  BOMBdotcom...I didn't even feel guilty about all of the calories because 1. it was my birthday 2. who the hell cares when it comes to chicken and waffles and 3. ITS VEGAS #turnup.  I will definitely be coming back to this place on a regular when I go back to Vegas.  Forget the buffets, this is really all I need and its way cheaper.  We went to Ceasar's before this and the buffet was $50 (but then again, it was Thanksgiving weekend).  Thank you for the excellent service.  I hope you guys keep this type of customer service consistant but I have a good feeling about it.
If you're a fan of unbelievable breakfast, don't look any further than HH. On a recent trip to Las Vegas, we needed some great food and a Bloody Mary to cure the blues from the night before. The portions will satisfy even the largest people on the planet. Think of a pancake as big as the turkey platter you just used. Yes, that big. They also offer tons of other plates equally as large, so bring your appetite.. The ambience is very "farm-like" so if you're into tractors and combines and such, you'll feel right at home. Everyone that works there is dressed the part and is as friendly as you'd expect from Indiana or Arkansas. Service was prompt and courteous. . Very important for me- if you're not a fan of Starbucks, Hash House will make you a much better cup of coffee to go. They score extra points for that in my book!
By far the best bang for your buck on the Strip. $15 for the most humongous plates, like chicken and waffles? That's why there's always a line here, even at odder times of the day. But still worth it because you can probably share the dishes and be full! They are indeed that huge.. . That said, we paid decently on the cocktails, and I didn't really like my electric blue sports drink cocktail (forgot the name). I think out of my friends, we only got 1 drink we liked. The waffles were pretty good, but I found the chicken to be pretty dry. Probably because I'm from the South and love my fried chicken juicy and greasy, but oh well.
It is a definite place to go to when you are at Vegas. It has been featured on Man vs. Food and you have to try the Benedict entree. It is big so if you want to share then that is okay. For me, I am a hungry guy and it always make me full and is delicious in taste. Do come here and try their food!  It can be a little pricy but definitely worth it!
Amazing! Always a long wait but worth every second. So much food you can share. We love breakfast and lunch. The drinks at the bar are a work of art!
Every time I go to Vegas, I always want to stop by in this restaurant to eat and to take a break from all the gambling.  It's always busy in here but it is always worth the wait!!. . After waiting for about 30 to 40 minutes, we were seated and then we were greeted promptly by out server.  She was really nice and she was patient with us since she probably could tell we were a little hung over from the night before.  She recommended the bloody mary to help!!  Cool points to her for that.  . . I recommend trying their hash dishes.  You won't be disappointed.  I actually love the corned beef hash.  Remember, the portions are big and you probably won't be able to finish all of it.  Another dish I tried before is the sage chicken and waffles.  That was also another huge plate and the chicken was cooked perfect over a great tasting waffle.  . . They also make great drinks!!  If you're not yet drunk from drinking while you're gambling, try the drinks they make here.  If you're hung over still try the drinks here.  You know the saying, the only way to cure a hangover is to drink more.  . . Great restaurant.  Great prices.  Great atmosphere!
In Vegas, wherever you can find cheap and large portion places is filled with people. we arrived this breakfast place on a Saturday noon around 11am, and the wait line is about 1 hour and 15 min long for two people. Well, I guess people here have nothing else to do, so the wait is tolerable. . . Since there is no where else you can find easy meal, we decided to wait. The restaurant is actually pretty big. A lot of people. Serve is fast though. The food took about 20-25 min to arrive, so that part was not too bad. But the food itself was not that great.. . We had a mojito, which was pretty strong and tasty. The food indeed came in huge portion, but the taste wasn't that great. We tried the french toast, which was lack much flavor except for the sweetness from the syrup. And my omelette with mushroom was very plain as well. Not taste of the egg. And the potato on the side was not crispy and not so great. The only highlight was their homemade strawberry jam and whipped butter. Those help the plain food to be more tasty.. . This is Vegas. Line up for the not so great food only for the big portion and cheap price.
words can't express the taste buds in my mouth. .everything so fresh and hot..this place is amazing the staff is amazing and honest. the drink or incredible. .i love the side glass...can't wait till we return
Never disappoints. First time at the Vegas location. It's open 24/7 which I like. Had pork tenderloin sandwich and French toast tracker. Portions are huge!
This place is fantastic!!. Food-Awesome. Cocktails-Awesome. Staff-Awesome. Price-Awesome. You get plenty of food and the place is clean! . Gary our waiter was amazing, fast and very easy on the eyes. He attitude and kindness was the frosting on the cake!!. **********
If you're looking for a good meal that is farm fresh come here.  This is not your traditional coffee, eggs, and toast farm fresh meal it is  much more.  The portions are huge also, I recommend splitting a meal with someone.  Be prepared to wait though as this is a really popular place both times I have been here I had to wait about 30 minutes.  Once I got inside it only took about 20 minutes to get my food once I was seated.  They have really good Bloody Mary's lemonades and chocolate milk.  I recommend getting Andy's sage fried chicken - spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs.
We met with family here for breakfast.  The portion sizes are ginormous. Their servers are friendly, The food is great.  There's not much that doesn't come with mashed potatoes.  Nobody was able to finish their food.  If you're a healthy eater,  order a lot of ala carte. The eggs were great,  and the hot chocolate was out of this world.  It's hard to find if you're not familiar with the area but if you self park at The Flamingo and walk straight through their casino,  past the Flamingo Habitat,  you'll see The Linq across the street and it's right inside. The escalators are marked HASH HOUSE.
Large portions for a reasonable price. Not amazing food, but it was good and exactly what we needed after drinking all night. This place is definitely a must for drunken nights and hangovers.
Really good when you feel like splurging and gorging yourself. Lol. The biggest servings of crazy concoctions, don't ask about calories or fat content. Better suited for those with a gall bladder.
Had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and it was very good, but the service was flat out horrible.  40 minutes to get our food and the beer that i ordered when i sat down.  The place wasnt all that busy either.
When I'm craving breakfast at anytime of the day I instantly think of the typical IHOP, Denny's, or some nearby casino cafe. Well now that I've officially dined at Hash Hash A Go Go I'll instantly think of here. It's breakfast 24/7 with huge plates.It also happens to be on the Vegas Strip. The portions are no joke humongous come here to stuff your face bringing someone to help eat is recommended. I believe they were also featured on some travel channel or food network show which is always cool.. . Sage chicken benedict http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=cGsK1B1Z519hdfb6YeX3HA it's a must here so delicious.. . The corned beef hash http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=_OC3pVhtKBDqgIhJeCqMPA waspretty good too. It came with eggs and a huge biscuit.. . And dont forget the softball sized biscuits drenched in gravy or not but why wouldn't you drench them in.gravy it only makes sense to.. . How about those huge French toast and pancakes. The French toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=T-5Gzq0cSGBQN5dOBAVIOw was covered with nuts, whipped cream, syrup, and powdered sugar. And those pancakes seemed almost an inch thick and was almost as large as the plate it was served on. They offer different flavors, like pumpkin! . . Customer service was excellent. We were in and out with no problem. Our server, forgot his name, was such a character made the whole experience even better than what we'd expected. The price is reasonable for the amount of food.. . Considering I had just eatan at a Xmas party maybe an hour ahead then unknowingly demolished a whole plate here the food has to be good. I'll definitely be back. Maybe they'll take that Groupon I bought a few years back for a location that closed at M casino.
Wow, server steve was outstanding. Gave us newbies the best advice.  Didnt want to waste time, so quickly asked, "whats your favorite on the menu?", and this dude knocked it outta the park. Worth a good tip indeed.  . . Did the andy sage chicken thingy.  Jen had the chicken and waffles.  Frickin huge.  Solid service, great food, great tastes,....all as advertised.  Coffee was excellent, large OJ was large, water was cold and filled quickly. Food hot, delivered quickly, and man did it hit the spot. . . We beat the crowd and showed up ona Tuesday am at 1030.  Thought it was a good move, and it paid off.  Will visit again.  Valet parking at Rio the way to go.  Duke the valet, and you get solid directions.
Huge portions, and open 24/7.  The food was just okay, nothing unforgettable. There was no waiting at 230am!
I was really looking forward to Hash House. Everything was good, but sadly nothing was great. Our server was friendly but with an agenda. There were two items he recommended - chicken and waffles, and the fried chicken benedict. I wanted the former, so that was fine. But David, rebel that he is, wanted instead a combo of fried chicken, eggs, bacon mashed potatoes and biscuit. Our server tried hard to steer David back to the benedict - "you have to trust me on this". But it wasn't what he wanted, and he stood firm. Substituting sausage for bacon was not allowed. Maybe that's what happens when you wander off the recommended path. My chicken was very generous, and I loved the fried leeks on top. One piece of chicken was very good, the other had some soft and chewy bits and just didn't taste as good. The waffles were ok, but nothing special. David liked his chicken, but thought the potatoes were uninteresting and the biscuit heavy. On the way out we reminisced about an amazing breakfast we had on our last trip which was to Seattle at Lola. This wasn't that. It's an interesting breakfast place but not a great breakfast place.
Hash House gets a solid 4 stars from me because my first visit was 5 stars, and my second visit was 3 stars. However, the inconsistency is something to say in itself. . . The first time I visited Hash House was in San Diego where I decided that it was the best breakfast I've ever eaten. I can't remember what I ordered since it was awhile back, but that feeling of satisfaction has never left my mind. . . More recently I went to the Vegas restaurant, eagerly awaiting my breakfast bliss once again as I climbed up the escalator @ Linq. This time, I was much more disappointed. I got the chicken rosemary hash and unfortunately the chicken was dry and bland. The eggs were ordinary. The only thing I loved on my plate was the huge flakey biscuit with a huge stick of rosemary speared through the middle.. . Note, they dont take reservations so you just have to wait.. and wait... and wait... Their seating area isn't huge so be mindful of the time if you leave the seating area and hang out in the casino.
This place is awesome! !! The size is ridiculously big for its price. First time to Vegas,  this is the only wow experience food restaurant.  Though the line is long but we got lucky to get seats very quick. . . I ordered a pork chop which is bigger than my face!!. For its price, it come in very very huge size. The picture provided did nor serve justice. I would suggest if you're not big greasy eater, order something to share! Save stomach for something else if possible.
GREAT service, GOOD food, MEDIOCRE cocktail (bloody mary's are premixed, supposedly every morning, but it was super watery). . . We had the popular Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Stuffed Waffles, and ordered a side of eggs & a homemade biscuit. . . Hubby loved it, I thought it was just good.  They do have AMAZING  tasting syrup, haha, yeah that stood out to me, weird but true :). . Would go back, but personally I'd try a benedict or omelet next time.
The service here was great!  The food was even better, though.  It is comfort food, but done so well!  The sage fried chicken tastes like you're biting in to Thanksgiving.  The side of salmon that my friend ordered with her salad was huge and delicious.  It was better prepared than what she had at Craft Restaurant the next day, and it was a fraction of the price.  These people are clear about what they want to deliver and then do it with excellence.  Well done!
Yes.....Yes.....Yes.....Yes.....Yes.....Yes.....Yes.....Yes.....Yes.....Yes.....Yes..... thats all I have to say about that!
Food itself is 3-3.5 stars, but the prices bring it up to a solid 4.. Compared to everywhere else in Vegas, it's a good deal!. . Cons:. - Potatoes are not particularly crispy.. - Only hot sauce is tabasco.. - Smoked salmon in smoked salmon scramble came out cooked, not lox-style.
We shared a GREAT meatloaf scramble with mashed taters...enough for 4 people. .Steven, our server, was always there with fresh brewed.  Just a yummy fun time...we come here on every visit to Lost Wages.
Had tried to come in for lunch but it was smack in the middle of lunch rush on Saturday and opted not to wait an hour for a table. Instead, we came back that evening for dinner. Ambience is very casual for a place where the food can actually get pretty pricey. However, it is very good, and the portions are TREMENDOUS (we made one giant to go box and gave it to a homeless man on the strip). . . Fiancee ordered the chicken and waffles and could barely eat half of it. I myself had the blackened chicken skillet and only made my way through 3/4. Chicken was nice and tender for both our entrees. Friends ordered the NY Strip and it was actually a very impressive steak for a place like this. . . Service was so-so but we didn't expect a whole lot so not a big deal.
Was not impressed in the least! Yes, the portions were huge but the condiments to go along with it were incredibly skimpy. Very overpriced for the quality of food. What I go back? No, not at all.
Good food that doesn't feel/taste like all the other casino places.  Fun atmosphere and awesome waiter equates to a 4 star rating.  I'd go again and you should give it a try...enjoy!
The ultimate locale to get fattening food in Vegas (and San Diego). I got their fried chicken tower with waffles, and it was delicious! The fried chicken was huge, but juicy throughout and very well-breaded. The waffles were crisp, and the bacon inside added a good meaty taste, I was wondering why IHOP doesn't do that too. The hashes are very tasty too! The price isn't cheap, but for the portions you get, you can get two or three meals out of a plate. Expect a long wait unless you go super late at night, it's veryyy popular.
Place has the weirdest foods which makes it harder to order something DECENT. And the lady that calls up the party's for their table is one of those very rude employees that scream in a rude tone. And on the way out I within a couple feet and she screamed "mike party for 5" and I almost went deaf. And floor is oldish and weird decor.
Zero star not worth the 2 hour wait. The service was really poor. I made eye contact so many times because the food took so long about 30 mins. The chicken and waffles were really floury. This place is overrated. They advertise with yelp. Why would a good restaurant pay for yelp?
Awesome food and awesome service.  We arrived around 8:45am on a Friday and waitedabout 20 minutes, not too bad.  Our server, Lonzo, was quick and knowledgeable.  We ordered the famous Chicken and waffles and the corned beef hash breakfast.  Both did not disappoint.  Hash House A GoGo is WORTH the wait Vegas Diners!  It is inside the Linq Hotel, on the second floor.
Wow! Lots o food!! Very above average, order 1 meal for every two people. If you don't walk away full...you must be a bottomless pit! Lots o carbs...cures a hangover!
This place gets two stars from me for being open 24 hours and a third star for good service. However, just based on quality of the food, I'd say, one star. Portions are huge but the food has no taste. May be they figured the "late late night" diners don't care. I had a bacon/avocado scramble. It was very bland and felt like someone threw in all the leftovers into the pan. My husband ordered a Benedict. And wow, we were speechless. This mess of a plate had a biscuit, scramble, deep fried battered chicken, and mashed potatoes.  It was nowhere near a Benedict and was disgusting. Even the parts of the dish alone were not that good. I guess this dish's big claim to fame is that it was featured on Man vs. Food. I'd say you are better off eating at a fast food place.
Went here around 11ish the morning after Christmas and the wait for a party of 4 was about 30 minutes or so.  Not too bad considering how packed it was!. A solid 5 stars for the food!!  We ordered the chorizo hash, the bacon/avocado scramble with griddled mashed potatoes, sundried tomato/goat cheese scramble with crispy potatoes, and the brown sugar banana pancake (a must-try!).  The portions were HUGE and awesome.  The 4 of us were starving when we came in and barely finished half of all the food we ordered.  Definitely recommend sharing!. Minus 1 star for the waiting area (very cramped and not a lot of space to sit or stand while you wait), noisy (the hostess screams the name of each party as tables become available and it can get annoying...also difficult to hear her over all the people...they should use a microphone/speaker system).  Also, the restaurant itself was kinda dim/dark and not the cleanest.  Service was okay, not great, not horrible, but got the job done.. Overall, a great brunch spot with great food (and portions), if you don't mind all the noise!
Sage chicken and waffles are divine and feed 3-4 people. The waffles have bacon in them! Pancakes are gigantic! We take all of our out of town guests here... especially late at night!
Huge portions and tasty!  Pancakes are the size of hubcaps and usually when its about quantity taste gets lost but not here.  Everything is big besides the scramble.  It was suprisingly small.  Service was great both times we went.  Once mid day and the other 2 am.  Late night it's not a full menu even tho it's open 24 hours.  Great coffee and bloody marys.
Great food and plenty of it. Fried chicken and waffles was great. Upon seeing the size of the portions, 4 of us ordered 2 dinners and left food behind. Highly recommended.
This place has huge portions, seriously, share. I had the Sage fried chicken and waffles. They were great, although the fried leeks were a strange flavor addition. Blood Mary's were perfect and very spicy. The prices are great. . Why would they get two stars then? . Our waiter, Ricky, on 12/28/14 was high as a kite it seemed. I'm not sure what was wrong with the guy, but kept thinking he had made a mistake and then would come back and ask if he did it right. His eyes were glazed over and his speech was slurred. He introduced himself four or five times. . He got worried about splitting our bill three ways. . He had no idea that he had already brought our food properly. . Get it together, Ricky.
First, You need to wait 20 minutes to get seats, then the nightmare just begins.  We waited for 1 hour to get our food. Besides, the food is not worth the wait time.
Yummy, yummy for the tummy!!! The chicken and waffles are a must have!!! My new favorite spot in Vegas. The food is fresh and fabulous.
When we first came to this restaurant, there was a long line of people on the outside of the restaurant, waiting. We were expecting a wait time of around 30 minutes, but in 10 minutes, we were in the restaurant. We ordered the watermelon lemonade (non alchoholic), their famous chicken and waffles, and their fried pork tenderloin sandwich. The watermelon lemonade was okay, it was slightly sweet with lots of watermelon pulp at the bottom. You had to mix it with a straw to have the perfect sip. Both the chicken and waffles and the pork tenderloin sandwich were massive. The chicken and waffles consisted of two giant pieces of chicken on top of four waffles on the bottom. The chicken was very crisp, tender, and juicy, and the waffles were very soft on the inside and crisp on the outside. The waffles even had bacon baked into them, which was a huge plus. The pork tenderloin sandwich was massive. The size of the fried pork tenderloin itself was four times the size of the bread that held it. The pork tenderloin was very crisp on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside, just like the fried chicken on the waffles. All of the food combined could feed a small army. Will definitely be coming back.
This is a favorite of my wife and I. As always, bring your appetites!  The flapjack is roughly 12" diameter. The brown sugar banana flapjack is to die for.
Chicken and waffles was great! Me and my boyfriend shared. The biscuits are good. The hot chocolate was huge and yummy. . . We went early around 9 am and there was no wait. After us there was a whole lobby of people waiting! Restaurant is 24/7.
Worth the wait! Food comes out fast, huge portions and delicious! If you don't want to wait, eat at the bar and try one of their awesome drinks :)
It you like tasty gigantic portions at a fair price hash house is it the place for you. First of they prepare everything from scratch so it takes awhile to get it. But when your food comes to your table you can help but to drop your jaw and take a picture. I orders the snickers pancake (yes I said snickers) and the chicken & waffles tour.  The waffles had bacon fused into them give you the sweet & salty taste that's amazing  the snickers pancake was as large as a pizza. It was large and thick and tasted so good it makes you wanna slap your mamma !!!! Def wanna go back
