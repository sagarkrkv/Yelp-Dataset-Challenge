fast, delicious, and good pricing.  I can always depend on Earls after a couple days of Vegas, with my wallet crying from the extravagant overpriced meals that fill the strip.  This Earl is so much more amazing due to the fact that it's open 24 hours!!  Lines can get long, but move pretty fast.  Their ordering system is efficient and speedy.. . Bread is delicious and the types of sandwiches they offer all compliment really with with the ingredients they use.  Nothing crazy intense here like mozarella sticks or overly saucy sandwiches.  What they offer is popular flavors made to perfection.  All the sandwiches Ive had here have tasted top notch, no matter when I go.  Italian, holiday turkey, and the classic all tasted good.
Very meh. Possibly hyped up due toYelp reviews.... . I tried the Chipotle Chicken Avocado, and taste wise, it was just OK. The Chicken Bacon Avocado at Safeway is an upgraded version of it in both taste and portion... and you can always just add some spicier sauce if you want a kick. Also tried the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich. Chicken was slightly dry and overall nothing special.. . Overall, the portions were small and taste was average. If you compare to Subway, then ya, taste is good... but I've easily had much better sandwiches for the same price.
This is one of the hidden gems in Las Vegas. The sandwiches are tasty and reasonably priced. We ate there twice in 3 days. Went to the ABC store and got some beer too (it's just 2 doors down from Earl's) . it was great. Next time you're in Vegas, give it try. You will not be disappointed.
The Holiday Turkey sandwich is so good, I just ordered one 4 days after Thanksgiving!
Pros:. -Affordable. -Good location - middle of the strip, in Planet Hollywood. -Convenience - I think its open 24 hours, but I'm not 100% sure. . Cons:. -Line can get really long. . My boyfriend ordered the italian sandwich. He said it was very good. I ordered the baja chicken salad. It was horrible. I probably should have ordered a sandwich.
This past Vegas trip I went on for a friends' birthday, I had Earls three days in a row. You'd think I would be sick of it but I wasn't! It made my stomach happy but more importantly, it made my wallet happier (darn school loans).. . Located at the Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood. You get in line, order your food, pay at the end, and grab a buzzer. When that buzzer starts vibrating, it'll be the best feeling in the world because your food is ready! They have plenty of sandwiches to choose from and sides as well. From pasta salad and potato salad to cookies and chips, pick your poison. The prices here are really inexpensive and affordable, which is great since you're going to be blowing your money on other things. Like TeeFlii, it's open for 24 hourzzz. . I should probably try new things but my go-to sandwich here is the Chipotle Chicken Avocado hot sandwich. ZOMG hands down my favorite sandwich. You really can't go wrong with chipotle, chicken, and avocado. It's a very hearty sandwich with loads of flavors that will make your taste buds go wild. I also tried one of the breakfast sandwiches, it's called the egg white avocado bagel thin (?) something like that. Honestly, it wasn't that great; it was very plain and bland but it got the job done and "healthy". I'd stick to their specialty sandwiches!. . Earls is perfect for lunch, dinner, or the late night drunchies.
So good! I'm not normally a sandwich person but I needed a casual lunch spot and given the rave reviews, I figured it was worth a try.. Had the Earl original 1762 sandwich and it was awesome! Warm and tasty bread with thinly sliced beef and just a touch of horseradish... Great flavor! I paired mine with a creamy tomato soup and it totally hit the spot in this unusually cool and overcast Vegas weather.. . All the sandwiches appear to be $6.50. The soup and sandwich was a nicelyfilling lunch for $11 - am tempted to come back again to try another one!
Thank you YELP! On a night I just wanted something "light" and didn't want a full sit down meal, I found this amazing place! . . It lives up to its amazing reviews!
What can I add that has not been said?  Other than to say emphatically that this is not just a place to get cheap sandwiches.  It is clean. They are organized and packed.   I had an Italian sandwich which was worth every penny.  Too bad I have been buying the same size sandwiches for 11- 12 bucks here at Aria.
I've been wanting to try this place ever since it opened to rave reviews on Yelp.  But we don't go to Strip places very often unless we have a reason.  We finally did:  a new show with comp tix at Planet Hollywood, and two hungry Yelpers not wanting to wait to eat after the show ended.  Perfect match.   . . Hubby and I both decided to order the same sandwich, pastrami, which doesn't let me write an extensive review of the food.  It was a good sandwich, very lean pastrami, but not all that plentiful.  The reported swiss cheese wasn't noticeable.  That was okay with me: I don't like swiss cheese, but didn't change it because to my way of thinking, cheese on a pastrami sandwich is sacrilegious.. . Strip prices being what they are, though, I guess it was as much as we should have expected, because this was  reasonably priced based on Earl's location.  The bread?  Good, now that I've all but given up hope of ever finding a sandwich on a crisp baguette in Las Vegas.  I'll have to go back to the east coast for that bit of heaven.. . We also ordered a bowl of tortilla soup.  I didn't want to, since I learned only after asking that it's a cream soup.  Rule #1:  authentic tortilla soup does not contain cream.  Rule #2:  I should not eat creamed soups.  They're bad for me.  And for my husband.  But he's not as much as a stickler for the rules as I am, so I let him get it after learning - again only after asking - that the tomato soup was also CREAM of tomato.  So much for healthier alternatives.  Would it be so hard to write that on the chalkboard these soups were listed on?  Having said that, it was a very tasty soup, as long as I didn't tell myself that it was tortilla soup (See Rule #1 above).  . . In sum, Earl of Sandwich is a decent place if you're a tourist in LV on a budget.  For us, we're not likely to feel the urge to return unless we're at PH again for some reason and in a hurry.
Good for a quick bite. Nothing spectacular considering so many other options in Vegas.
Cheap-ish sandwich on the Strip.  Had the tomato soup and the Montagu.  Soup was piping hot with delicious croutons that were crispy but not crunchy (if that makes sense).  The sandwich with its roast beef had its delicious melted cheese with its special mustard sauce.  If you can't decide what to eat, stop on by here. Better than spending 5x+ times the cost at a buffet, in my opinion. Save the moneyfor more booze from Fat Tuesday.
Price alone would bring this place up to a 4, maybe even a 5, but alas...the value just wasn't there.. . I got the Original since I love horseradish sauce, and while I thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich, i was left sorely disappointed by the value. With a one dollar sign on Yelp, I figured it would be cheaper than it was.. . The sandwich itself came out to about 7 bucks, but a drink was TWO NINETY-NINE! so one measly fountain drink, and I broke 10 bucks for lunch. OK fine...hope the sandwiches are big...well, they aren't. They aren't small exactly, but they would never be qualified as big.. . I finished my sandwich not full, but I made sure to get a refill of my soda to make up for the 3 bucks I spent on it. . . I don't know why in the hell I went to a strip lunch place and didn't expect strip prices, but shame on me.
I don't do sandwiches. But for Earl of Sandwich, I gladly make the exception. I love the Tuna Melt. This is the only thing I order from here. . . The melted cheese reminds of a delicious hot pocket. I know that might not sound really appetizing to some but honestly the melted cheese takes me back to my childhood. Just imagine a ham and cheese hot pocket, except way better bread and replace the ham with tuna. And the cheese, there's like 10xs way more cheese than a hot pocket.. . Another reason why this is a five-star is its location. It's easily accessible from casinos on the Strip. . . Quality food at an affordable price. Definitely hit the jackpot on this!
Not only fairly priced the sandwiches are truly 5 star amazing. I got a bbq hawaiian chicken it was warm fresh and amazing. Cant say enough. 2 sandwiches and a coffee was 16 bucks. Very very fairly price and delish. Its a must go to
First time here. Had the Italian with a side of potato salad. The sandwich is really good and the potato salad is... Well, a potato salad. . The only reason it lost a star is because of lack of easy access. It's an inconvenient trip to get there. If they had one outside of the casinos/ strip I'd probably eat there every other day.
Seriously, hands down one of the best places to eat in Vegas. GREAT price and AMAZING food. Only downside, it is so popular the wait time was a little long (but still acceptable given the outcome). Would definetly recommend and go there anytime!
Maybe Las Vegas doesn't have sandwiches?? Because I can't understand why this place has so many 5 star reviews. I ate here based on the reviews, and man was I disappointed! I got the club and my husband had the Reuben. They were both average at best. Nothing special AT ALL. They tasted like boring sandwiches from a chain restaurant. I would only eat here if I worked in the Planet Hollywood mall and had a short lunch break.
This was sincerely one of the tastiest soup and sandwich combos I've ever had. The Chicken Pesto sandwich and the Chili soup were just perfect!
"Eh" about sums this place up.  It's an overpriced "gourmet sandwich" shop that's actually an overpriced worse than average sandwich shop.  The cold sandwiches you get at kiosks in the airport are better than these.  I'm pretty sure they no longer exist in the MGM, and I can see why.
Nothing left to really be said; the volume and quality of the reviews speak for themself. You won't be disapointed even if you are a world class sandwich expert that judges at international compatitions... Price is amazing considering it's Vegas. Probably will make this our lunch stop daily through our trip.
Man oh' man oh' man! The best sandwich I have ever had in my life. Come here to find out!
Newly opened food court.   Got the Montague and the Earl Club.   Both are good but Montague was better.  Price was 7.99 each and 6.99 for club members.   Wish the sandwiches were bigger.
This is a Vegas-must. For how crowded this place can get at any time, the staff sure handles this flow efficiently! It might be a little tough to find Earl of Sandwich but just use a map (if you are sober) or ask around. Sandwiches used to cost anywhere from $5 to $7 but now it's all one price... I believe $6 each. Plus within the last year they significantly cut down the menu. . . My favorite sandwich is/was the Carribean Jerk Chicken, but I have now settled for the Chicken Chipotle. For me, the sandwiches are kinda dry because of the bread, but I love that they are always hot and delicious! One of the ultimate Vegas cravings.
Dropped by for breakfast as the first spot upon arrival.  The line was relatively quick. The food was tasty. I ordered the Mac and cheese along with the pastrami sandwich.  . . One star off cause the order took longer than expected then when I went up the food was ready.... Kind of counterproductive when you give out alarms.
A very nice place to have a light meal. We went there twice and tried a couple of sandwiches and wraps. All sandwiches and wraps are less than $7 and they were all good. The location is very nice too since it's so close to Planet Hollywood and other hotels/casinos in the strip. Another good point about this place is that they serve coffee and breakfast (the breakfast is only till 11:00 though).
I had a ruben pastrami and it was good. Not great but good. Bread is toasted, not enough meat, way too much sourkraut. . Line was pretty long, however, they were able to serve pretty fast for the volume they were handling. . Coleslaw was ok, too much green onions.. Buddy got mac and cheese, it looked pretty good.
I think this place is a bit overrated. I don't agree they make "The world's greatest hot sandwiches" that's a pretty big claim. You don't get to select the type of bread or customize your sandwich like most sandwich shops do so you're stuck with what you ordered. My son didn't like his non "grilled cheese" sandwich which looked more like a warm muffin with cheese in it and a bit dry I might add. My ham and cheese sandwich was ok didn't blow me away -- average at best. Prices I like but not the long wait, not enough tables and chairs to accommodate the crowd is what really killed it for me. We literally waited 45 minutes for our order while trying to find seating for four. We ended up spending more than an hour at this "slow food" joint. Would I come back next time? Probably but avoid lunch and dinner times at all cost unless you like slow service and the crowd.
Shared a Ruben pastrami, full mantague and had a mac n cheese. . The bread was perfectly toasted. Crunchy outside. Soft inside. . The full mantague was hands down better than the pastrami. . Coming back again
Best of the best sandwich I love this place the only negative thing is long lineeeees.
I had the Chicken Thai Wrap with peanut Sauce Dressing. It was very tasty.  I ordered a side cole slaw and it was just ok tasting. The sandwiches are reasonably priced and they are opened 24 hours. A great place to go after for the night clubbing crowd...
Lost our order and ended up waiting 30mins till the issue was addressed. Horrible when im hungry af.
Considering there isn't many cheap and good places to eat for your average college student just trying to have a good time in Vegas, I had to give this place 5 stars. And yes, this is a sober review.. . I appreciated how efficient the customer service was. When I first got the sandwich, I thought it was relatively small but it was actually pretty filling!. . I tried the Chipotle Chicken Avocado and the Holiday Turkey sandwhich. There were both reallyyyyyy good. Loved how they were hot sandwiches as the bread was toasted to perfection.. . However, if I had to choose between the two again, I would just get the Chipotle Chicken Avocado sandwich because I think the ingredients in this sandwich went really well together.. . 4.5 stars for their quality of food and price. Now I know why it's wrapped in gold foil.
Wow!!  What a gem on the strip. Went to Bobby Flay's and the Buffet at Bellagio, spent hundreds of dollars and came away disappointed. Came to this place and were blown away.  Everything was wonderful. The bread that they use is wonderful, plenty of meat and tons of flavor. The soup at Bellagio was inedible and tasted like dishwater...the soups and chili here was full-bodied and flavorful. Highest rating possible.
Why does this place have such good reviews!? These are regular sandwiches that you could get just about anywhere else. We got the Earl's club and chipotle chicken avocado and were expecting something out of this world based on the reviews and the food turned out to be just OK. I guess compared to other restaurants this place is cheap so maybe that's what the attraction is because the food definitely isn't.
feel like quality has declined... their menu has changed no more meatball =( but still a good option for late night eats still 24/7
I ate here during my trip to Vegas this past weekend.  It was convenient because I stayed at Planet Hollywood anyway and it's located in the Miracle Mile Shops.  I wanted to see what the hype was about.. . I really didn't know what to order but scanning through their Yelp pics, looks like The Full Montagu seemed to be popular so that's what I got and my belly was satisfied!  Oh and don't forget to order their side of Mac & Cheese.  So bomb!  Tastes homemade.  They even cooked it in this mini foil pan for each serving.  Delish!
We waited in line, placed our order at 1:06pm, found a table, and started to wait for our food.. 45 minutes later nothing and we started to wonder if it really take that long to make 2 sandwiches, 1 mac and cheese, and 1 salad?  So I went up to ask for our order and even told them when the order was placed...and then the  manager came and took my receipt to check on out order. As soon as I saw the manager walking back and forth and yelling out our number to see where's our sandwiches I knew they didn't have our order! While I was getting more frustrated I realized there's two more ladies around was also frustrated with the similar issue!!. Earl of Sandwich, you might want to improve or upgrade your system so the orders wouldn't go missing and make your customers wait forever while expecting their order is going to come out soon. . . 1 star for our first visit disappointment and will not visit again since there are other places to try too.
Having lived in Philly for almost a year, I've established a love-hate relationship with sandwiches. I eat them all the fucking time but I just can't stop because 1) sandwiches here are generally delicious, 2) there isn't an abundance of other great types of food in this area (flame suit on). . . Given this, I have to say that Earl is vastly overrated. Earl of Sandwich is amazing because you're drunk and hungry after doing all those drugs and dancing in Vegas at 3 in the morning with nothing else to eat, not because it is anything special.I tried over four sandwiches on my one trip to this place and while they were all decent (the pastrami and chicken avocado as the stand outs), it ain't no 4.5 stars. Make sure to ask for some horseradish sauce on the side with your pastrami as it'll add a nice kick to your sandwich.
3.5 stars. . The sandwiches aren't worthy of the overall 4.5-star rating here on Yelp but they are good enough .... as snacks!  The sandwiches are small and there's hardly any meat in them to the point where you might wish you had more... or perhaps ordered two for yourself.  . . We got:. . Pastrami Reuben - I really liked this as the flavor was definitely there but was disappointed when there was hardly any pastrami in my sandwich.  If I were to come back, I'd get this one again, though, since I'm a fan of pastrami.. . The Full Montagu - This had roasted beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  This wasn't bad but it definitely had more meat than the other sandwich.  Again, the sandwich was the same size as the other -- small! . . This place is convenient if you are either staying around the strip but I'd rather drive and explore what else Vegas has to offer.  I'm sure they have better sandwiches that have generous portions of meat for about the same price.  As good as the pastrami reuban was (minus the lack of pastrami), I'm most likely to pass these sandwiches up and drive to some place else.  Worth a try, though!
Located inside the Planet Hollywood, I finally got to try the famous Earl of Sandwich.  Oddly enough, I live in the LA area and never got around to trying the one in Downtown Disney.  The line was long when we got here mid-afternoon, but it was moving at a decent pace.  THIS PLACE IS OPEN 24 hours, which is pretty awesome.  The service was awesome and the staff answers any of your questions in a friendly manner.  . . The sandwiches are cut in half already, so it's perfect for sharing two different types like I did with one of my friends. (:  Each sandwich costs about $7-8? and their sizing is ok.  You won't be overly stuffed with the portion, but I was content.. . CHIPOTLE CHICKEN AVOCADO: This sandwich came with grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce, and this bomb chipotle sauce! I loved it and would totally order this again!!. . HAWAIIAN BBQ: This sandwich comes with grilled chicken, ham, swiss, pineapple, and bbq sauce.  I'm not usually a fan of hawaiian pizza or sandwiches, but this was awesome!!. . I loved both the sandwiches and their flavorful tastes.  Definitely stop by if you can! (:
