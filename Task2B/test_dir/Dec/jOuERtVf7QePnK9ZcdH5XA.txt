Ate here the day after Thanksgiving for a quick lunch.  I got the lemon salmon piccata.  I liked it a lot.  Kid got the kids pasta, she gobbled it.   Husband got the soup, salad, sandwich combo.  Service was quick and attentive.  Will definitely be back when in Vegas.
Grand Lux Cafe has become one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.  I visit Vegas maybe three to four times a year and I make it a must to eat at the Grand Lux at least once per visit. Its open 24 Hours and their service is excellent. Their hamburgers, pizzas, pastas, salads are delicious! There has not been a single item that I have disliked. My favorite item on the menu is the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Salad, it is to die for! I have not found a better salad than this. I highly recommend it!  . . The prices are fair and the portions are huge, every order is enough for two people. You're definitely getting bang for you buck!!. . It is a definite must for everyone!
Even though this is the same restaurant as in The Palazzo, food here is just slightly over seasoned. Have tried the traditional breakfast, lunch and dinner here. I would skip the pastas and just get either a sandwich or burger. Had a steak sandwich and it was great.
I visit Grand Lux at the Venetian frequently and have never been disappointed.  The options are many, including pasta, salads, main entrees and desserts.  If you have been to Cheesecake Factory, you will understand this is a similar menu.. . The servers have always been very attentive from initial order, to drink refills and checkout.  . . I've tried a variety of the meals here.  The Crispy Caramel Chicken is outstanding with a bit of sweetness to go with a little kick.  The steamed rice accompanies nicely.  The Buffalo Chicken sandwich, the Club, Chicken and Waffles, and several salads are a big hit as well.. . One tip: Order a dozen cookies when you first sit down and they are delivered to your table warm when you get ready to leave.  Excellent!. . Grand Lux is a great option for groups or if you want a nice variety to choose from.  Definitely recommend!
I have eaten at this restaurant many times over the years. I love it because of the diversity of the menu and generally good food.  This week was no exception. We ordered spring rolls filled with potatoes. They were not as warm as they should have been but they were still absolutely delicious.. My friend ordered a paste dish which she enjoyed but it was very rich. I had the Asian nachos. They were unique and quite good. . Service was good. She wasn't the most astute server but adequate and friendly enough. . This is a great place for good food and when you with a big group with a lot of different preferences or don't know what you want to eat. Lots of great choices.
I would like to share my amazing experience with the "grand lux cafe" at the Venetian.. this place have a great service! I went there for lunch and the server was super nice! They serve a very good portion size! I loved the salmon pasta... They busy most of the time so it's better order seats ahead.   . Its a place I highly suggest to eat  If your at the Venetian u most go there and the staff is amazing :)
If you like Cheesecake Factory you will like this place. It's the same company but jus packaged a little differently. It's a great option for meal to soak up all the alki after a long night of partying or gambling. The food portions are rather big, I haven't been disappointed once. Price point is really reasonable, around $15 a plate depending on what you get. The service and ambiance is warm and cozy. It's not a super fancy upscale date, break the bank kind of place. Great for families and large group of friends to kick back and enjoy a good meal. They do get busy during peak hours but there is Bouchon bakery around the corner, you can get a little snack as you wait, or play the slots.
I have to say I'm pretty disappointed by the service. Got seated right away, but it took 20 minutes for a server to come to us. I actually had to ask another server for water and ask for the manager before even being contacted. Manager barley apologized. Horrible service. Decent food.
Worse service ever. We were the only customers seated in the back area since we were 5 in the group. The waiters and waitresses never check on us if we needed something and every time we needed more bread or water we had to call one of them.  When we were done eating, nobody check on us if we needed dessert or more food. The service was so bad that we had to ask a waitress where to get our bill to pay for our food.  We should not have given them any tip but still gave them 10% in gratuities just for the food.  Food was okay except for the poor customer service.
A great experience for anyone staying at the Venetian or downtown in general. Almost no wait to be seated and the service was incredible. The chipotle-avocado burger was one of the best I've had and the Grey Goose martini I ordered was spot on.
The food here was mediocre.  We ate here after a show because it was one of two restaurants that were open so late.  The serve breakfast all day, which others in party thought was good. I got the short rib grill cheese.  It was tasty, but it was less of a grill cheese and more of a short rib sandwich.  I would eat here again if it was late or I had few options.
My friends and I went into Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian for a late dinner and drinks.  The food was OK, our server was reasonably pleasant, but the night manager Matt Timms, when questioned about the cost of an item on our bill, was so off the charts rude- my friends and I will never come back!  Mr. Timms even went so far as to threaten to call my girlfriend's employer to make her look bad when he learned we were locals.  I've never seen someone lose their cool like that, especially not a manager.  There are many better options for restaurants within this casino.  Beware!
Excellent. I had the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya. There were big pieces of chicken and shrimp. It was excellent!
Came here for lunch with a few co-workers.  It took our group of 5 to get organized before we got seated. We got seated in short order.  I wanted to order a half four cheese and half sausage, pepperoni and mushroom rustic pizza.  The server didn't know if they would do this.   I said if thet didn't I would order the rustic pizza with sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms.  I wanted too take half the cheese pizza home for the kids.  Service so far was good. They brought our drinks pretty quickly. Later the server said that they couldn't make the pizza half cheese and meats/mush  the other half because the bases are different.  They brought out some bread to munch on. The bread was very very good. We asked for more bread-the server never brought any more. . . It seemed to take as while to get the food but don't remember how long it too. . . A co-worker ordered the four cheese pizza so we I gave him four pieces of my pizza and he gave me four pieces of his pizza so I could take it home for my kids.   The meats/mush pizza wad good but very salty.  My co-worker said the cheese was not nearly as salty.  Maybe it was from the pepperoni and sausage.  My water was filled once when I was halfway early on during our visit but not once afterwards. Others had water and iced teas, but it wasn't filled either. . . Couldn't make half cheese half meat/mush pizza, super salty pizza, no refill for drinks after getting our food, and no requested bread makes for a subpar rating.
Nice non-buffet breakfast. Feels like a fancy cheese cake factory. Generous servings.
Had a breakfast sandwich here. Pretty good, and a lot of food considering it's one of the cheaper items.. . The reason I'm writing this review, though, is I got an eclair at the bakery and it's the ideal eclair. It is the third or fourth eclair I've had in three days in Vegas and it's the only eclair that was 1) really good and 2) worth the money. The other eclairs I had were just about as much money ($3.95) but this one was four times bigger, filled with a ton of custard AND whipped cream, was covered in just the right amount of good quality chocolate, and was filling without being too rich. It wasn't dry like the other eclairs either. I will probably get another one later.
Been waiting forever to order something and others said they have been here for almost an hour with no food yet
Absolutely zero star to manager "Matt Timms". He treats customers like ? . I'm really sorry for Venetian hotel with zero class restaurant. And the food is really bad... I never go to venetians hotel again because grand lux cafe!
Veggies as a meal, just a plate of simple veggies with rice. I feel like I have found the only simple and nutritious meal on the strip.
The cafe is inside Venetian reasonable price great food a must try if u don't wanna eat buffet the chicken waffle is good
Everything on the menu is great! It's fresh and light- nothing greasy. Kept coming back even though there are more popular restaurants. This place is no less! Belgian waffles- amazing!
Food is always good. Service was slow today. Not up to normal standard. Asian Nachos are the bomb.
The place is huge and always very crowded. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. Our server ,Kevin, was very attentive. I ordered chicken Royal fordinner and I could not finish it. They do have medium size plates and probably those are more reasonable for one to order.i would recommend this place for breakfast or lunch as it probably has the best lunch deal on the strip
Bakers dozen !! That's all i have to say. Yummmiiii
This has to be one of the best breakfasts in Vegas!. . In fact the whole menu is really good. Great value for money and great atmosphere! I came here after having so many POOR experiences in Vegas it was a refreshing change to actually like somewhere. The waiting staff are very quick and it has a great range of food.. . Will be back every trip to Vegas!
Good service but terrible food experience ...... We ordered the turkey burger, shrimp spring rolls, plan waffle with butter and syrup, and chicken tenders and French fries.... We sent back everything but the chicken tenders and French fries (and that was off the kids menu)!!!!!! The waffle was over cooked, the vegi burger was gross and the shrimp wasn't cooked in the spring rolls! And at the end we asked the serve where to go to get the good food she said Omgoodness what did you order? We told her and she said "yea those are bad choice" at least she was honest and knew what we ordered was disgusting!!
Great selection! Great salads!  Great pastas!  In a location that is usually $$$$$ but it itself is not.
Chain restaurant but food quality is always good. Price is reasonable compared to other high-end restaurants inside the hotel. . . The Service: Very efficient and attentive. Never disappointed. . . The Food: . . Shrimp Scampi - Sauteed with White Wine, Lemon, Garlic, Fresh Tomato, Basil, Parsley and a Touch of Cream. Served with Pasta. Huge portion~ Lots of pasta. The shrimp is to die for. Cooked to perfection. Love the garlic taste shrimp. The sauce is very flavorful. My favorite on the menu!
