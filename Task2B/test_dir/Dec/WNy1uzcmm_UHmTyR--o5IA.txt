Quite frankly, my little sister doesn't understand why I write reviews on Yelp and it annoys her when I take pictures of food, but she has demanded that I give this place 5 stars and exclaimed, "Look at the craftsmanship (of the pastry)...this is actually worth a photo!" Sooo, yeah Cornish Pastry Co is a 4.5 in my book, easily rounded up to a 5.. . While I would probably never find and/or try this restaurant on my own, I was highly intrigued by the excellent ratings and sheer number of reviews, so my sister and I dropped in just after 11:00 for lunch. I think we made the rookie mistake of entering through the dark, candle-lit kitchen side (with tables along the wall) rather than the far door with the actual dining room, but sitting on either is fine. They even have a patio!. . The staff was great, answering any questions we had about the menu and service was well-paced. Now...the FOOD! As a (mostly) vegetarian, I was pretty blown away by the options - I have to eat a lot of veggie burgers elsewhere - but this place has a whole vegan/vegetarian page of items, some of which include veggie chicken and beef. Forget what anyone else has said...nothing could be better than the Eggplant Parmesan pastie! ;) My sister also loved her Lamb and Mint pastie, saying it was "effing delicious" and that the mint was not overpowering. The pastry is not doughy like pizza crust, but rather flaky and crispy like a biscuit. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, as they were fresh and still a little crunchy. . . Literally my only complaint about this place is that my meal was so good I kept trying to bite into it while it was still hot, burning my mouth multiple times. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm visiting my sis in Tempe, as I know she's about to jump on the Cornish Pastry Co regular train! She already has the "Pilgrim" pastie picked out as her next one to try and at about $9/meal, I bet she'll have worked through most of the menu by the time I see her again.. . Definitely put this on your "must see" list of places to eat (for lunch)!
Great food, mediocre service.  Not someplace to go with a big group or kids, but if you have a little time to wait - it's worth it!  If you like mushrooms, you must try the Mushroom, Walnut, & Spinach Soup, it's amazing!  I come from a long line of miners from Cornwall, and pasties were a staple growing up.  These are the closest to homemade you will find.  Although, they could use more rutabagas, in my opinion.
A great, very small place with big flavorful portions. I usually get the cajun (comes with a pretty spicy chipotle sauce) that I can only finish a half of. Service is great, people are very friendly.
Very nice place and awesome pastries. There haven't been a single instance when my pastry was not good, it has been always awesome. There are so many options for every kind of taste. Everyone I have taken there for lunch has liked whatever they have ordered. Decor and setup is very good and different than a regular lunch place. There was only one instance, when I felt bad because they asked us to free up the table when we were having a short after lunch talk, I can understand their constraint because it was raining outside and there were few people waiting for their table. Other than this instance, it has always been a nice place to have tasty lunch.
This establishment was amazing the ambiance was fantastic for a dinner setting, music playing was great, and the staff was friendly and informative. This was my first time eating here. Myfriend told me how good the food was here.  I being a foodie deiced to come and check it out. I ordered a beer, chips, shepherds pie, the greek and the apple desert. Everything I ate was amazing. It was well priced. I thought it was going to be more expensive but I was pleasantly surprised when the bill came out.

The ambiance is very good and traditional with dull light. Very hospitable service. Food is really good. I am not a favorite of the dough so I prefer the stuffings to the outer crust. Overall really good.

Big flavor for a small price.  Pasty's are the best but and the walnut soup is something I order even when it is 110 degrees outside.  It is that good!. . I have moved away from Tempe but I'll go to Pasty's every time I'm in town.
Great food, I have tried many things on the menu and The Pilgrim is one of my favs.  I ordered The Royal once at the one on Dobson.  Wasn't much of a fan of that on.  Think I prefer the taste of a burger on a bun rather than in a pasty.  Really like the space and a great looking bar, it has a dark feeling which I think is great.

Unique British "pasty" restaurant - kind of like a meal in dough. An amazing selection of pasties and great beer list. Funky vibe with good music in the background. Repeat visitor.
I absolutely love this place.  I eat here about 2-3 times a month, and at this point have had most of the menu.  Sometimes it gets very busy, and the service can be slow, but the food is great.  If you do takeout, I would suggest getting the pasty once-baked (IE not cooked through).  They seem to batch prep, then finish cooking to order.. if you order once-baked, you can finish it off in your oven at your discretion, which can be better.. . They tend to have British punk music about 3-4 days a week, never really payed attention to which days are which for music.  The atmosphere is okay, but I prefer the feel of the Scottsdale and Mesa locations, this one is just the closest to me.. . Some of my favorites include the Potato Leak Soup (best I've had anywhere), and the following pasties... The Mexican (vegetarian version is good too), Lamb Vindaloo (it's a little spicy), and the Carne Adovada.... I've haven't had anything that was outright bad, but the Royal had way more onion than I care for, and I also didn't care for The Italian either which was way too close to a calzone, but the difference in a pasty crust wasn't my taste.. . All said, pretty much everyone can find something to like here... fair warning, it is definitely not a carb friendly menu.. there are a few salads which are good, but it's not their mainstay.
Beyond excellent.  For the price you can't beat it, although drinks are about average cost.  The food reheats the next day almost as well as in the restaurant - and they have an option to order one of the pastys half-cooked for a few bucks cheaper that you can take home and finish (or stock up).  Definitely a Tempe type place, but everyone is friendly.  I highly recommend sitting at the bar where you can be entertained by them making everything just behind it.
These pastys are always good and it is damn near impossible to pick one you won't love. Their pick up service lets you buy one almost finished that you can complete at home in your over. If you are not in the mood for the relaxing, but energized atmosphere or just want to eat at home, that is the way to go.
Best place I've eaten in my three weeks in the Phoenix area so far. Cool atmosphere and great music. Bangers and Mash Pasty was a perfect portion and just top notch. Banoffee pie dessert was HANDS DOWN THE BEST DESSERT I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE
My friends raved about this place so I was really excited to try it. We all shared the different pasties that we each ordered and they were all flavorless and underwhelming. Was not a fan.
Visited this location for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It was an overall good experience. The atmosphere is a little different - very dark and trendy. Good music. Ample indoor and outdoor seating. Service was little slow (it was a weeknight, around 9:00 PM) throughout the dining experience. I really enjoyed the mushroom soup - it was excellent and also liked the chicken pot pie pasty. The bread - this is the deal breaker - the most amazing bread ever! You have to have it! Despite the service, I will definitely return.
I love Cornish Pasty Co. Plain and simple.  And they know how to simply and eloquently charm you with their cozy tables, dark atmosphere, and good music. Perfect for date night, a friendly lunch, or a quick bite to eat!
Never fails to hit the spot! I could eat here every week and still love it. Outstanding menu and great on-tap selection, too. Definitely a Valley gem.

This place is definitely unique and worth checking out if you've never been. They have some nice vegetarian  options too like vegetarian rosemary chicken.
Awesome! Few British pubs in the area and this place gets it right! Awesome beer selection and the prices can't be beat. Try the shepards pie pasty if you have never tried one- simply fantastic. It truly felt like we were back in Europe... Try something different and go to Cornish Pasty.
What a great find. I was with my friend over the Christmas holiday and we decided to check this place out. Upon entering this BAR/restaurant I was immediately turned off by the blasting of music so loud my heart was pounding. After ordering and waiting on our drinks I had decided to just leave because of the music but was presently surprised that after asking the waitresses to turn the music down, she did with a smile. I guess they prefer a total BAR atmosphere ! After surveying the menu for 15 minutes I decided on the Philly Cheese Steak Pastie and my friend went traditional with the Shepherds Pie.. Let me say we were NOT disappointed, the Pasties were fresh and yummy delicious, mine came with a mustard cream sauce as well as their red wine gravy that I had asked for. I prefer the gravy ! My friends Shepherds Pie with Lamb and the wine gravy was also yummy. After a short walk around I was surprised to see all of these wonderful pie's were being made FRESH behind a short order/bar environment. Yes just like we used to see in the drug stores, a griddle and gas fired 4 burner stove and a tiny convection oven If you've never had a pastie, its basically like a calzone but uses a pastry crust. There were over 25 different variations with several great looking desserts, we decided on the homemade bread pudding, more chocolate brownie tasting then traditional bread pudding, but tasty all the same.. There prices were fair for the Tempe area, $9.50 and $9.75 respectively and the bread pudding was $7.50.. I am looking forward to dining there again when they are not out of their homemade sausage.. If you don't care for a Bar atmosphere, loud music, dark and dingy then you should steer clear or set outside.. I should add that I found it extremely odd that they used old church pews for a large part of their seating.
I want to give this place more than five stars, this is one of my favorite restaurants, period.. . I remember when this place opened, being British I was on my way over there as fast as I could drive to get a fill of a much-missed pasty. Back then there was only one location, and it was tiny tiny tiny. It's so exciting to see this place grow and expand like it has.. . I've tried their entire vegetarian menu and it is awesome, with so many options. Their veggie tikka masala is my favorite. Freakin' good sides, too. I love their garlic red potatoes. Great beer list, I love their recent addition of a rotating sour beer.  Usually get good service.. . It's dark and a bit dingy, sometimes a bit loud, a atmosphere that I think works well for the establishment. There's plenty of outside seating with heat lamps, too.
Amazing pasties.  Creative fillings, something for everyone.  Good prices.  Great service.  Friendly atmosphere.  Will definitely be going back.
I had a Bangers & Mash Pasty the other night. I've never had one of any kind before this. It was one of the best things I have ever eaten. It was just as good the next day too. I never eat left over at all! Must try!
