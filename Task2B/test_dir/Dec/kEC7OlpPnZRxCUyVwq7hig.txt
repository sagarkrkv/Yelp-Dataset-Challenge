This review is after having stayed in the older "Casino" tower of the hotel. I presume and hope my experience could have been much better had I forked over the dough to stay in one of the newer rooms. . . PLUSES: The rooms were a nice size and well appointed. Bed was comfortable and didn't give me any problems. . . The casino is well laid out, I love the center circular bars, and in general has a very friendly staff.. . MINUSES: I'm not big on having a luxurious bathroom, so it really takes a bad one to bother me, but this one really did. I felt like i was in the movie Elf in the shower... My head was barely below the ceiling. The sink didn't drain well and was full of water after a few seconds of running the faucet. All in all,  I've been to several Holiday Inns with MUCH more impressive bathrooms than these. As a guy, i guess it's fine, but i would imagine a gal getting dolled up in one of these before a night on the strip would be pretty troublesome. . . Carpets in the hotel hallways were also worn out and really dingy looking. . . This all being said, I'll reiterate that I stayed in the OLD tower, meaning I payed under $100 on a Saturday night, so I guess you get what you pay for.
Just recently stayed at the hard Rock hotel it was pretty awesome great service, great room. The only thing that was not great is that it's  not on the strip. I tought it was but it's abt 1 block away from the strip so pass on if your looking to stay on the strip. Also it's a hassle trying to get to the strip ur better off walking or paying for a taxi. Never mind the taxi (taxi is 10+5 dollar tip) if you don't mind paying 15 bucks for the taxi to take u 1 block up go for it, but me i only took the taxi once and decided to take the bus next time, the bus goes directly to the strip and it's only 2 bucks.
My best friend and I came here years ago (Aaron) the same weekend we saw Velvet Revolver. The memorabilia in the eatery was cool to see, they have a pretty impressive collection. The food was okay and the prices were decent. As a souvenir we bought a Cure, Velvet Revolver and U2 casino chip. The service was nice and friendly.
**NOTE the VERY restrictive Outside Food Policy**. . The hotel is nice and the staff is okay.  You must be wondering why the two star review then.. . The biggest beef I have is their outside food policy.  I understand not being able to bring things in to a restaurant or concert venue but not have never been denied bring some snacks and drinks to my room.  I did know the policy going in but we wanted to stay the night there after a concert.  Below is the outside food policy and note that it excludes ALL food except medicine and a small cooler for kosher foods.. . "In order to maintain a safe environment, the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino prohibits coolers; boxes; bags; or other containers for the purpose of transporting food and beverage on property. In addition, all outside food and beverage is also prohibited." . . The guy at the elevator searched everyone going up and I witnessed someone having an unwrapped candy bar taken away.  The guard really embarrassed the guy to and threatened to have him kicked off the property for violating the outside food policy.  . . This is the reason I rate this place two stars.  It is their attitude not to allow you to bring any food or drink to your room. I would be okay with them restricting things but to exclude everything is insane.  I would have liked to bring some snacks and beverages like I do for every other hotel stay.
I stayed over Halloween weekend this year.  It is a HUGE hotel, for sure!  I got lost several times just trying to make it from the garage to the hotel.  Staff was nice and the hotel is super interesting with a casino downstairs and music memorabilia throughout (not just rock stars but all genres).  Room was a decent size and very clean. I didn't love the mini bar system - it's weighted so if you move anything you are charged.  I made a special effort not to touch it.  I also didn't like the fact that there was no indoor pool.  There were maybe 4 or 5 outdoor pools though and they were nice.  Spas, shops and restaurants in the hotel so that was very convenient.  Food was moderately priced and just 'ok' for me.  Halloween night was fun with all types of folks coming through!  I took pix of the costumes (which ranged from very simple to EXTREMELY elaborate).  I was going to attend the Halloween party but when I realized it was $100 cover I opted out and just walked around the casino instead.  I was suffering from major sticker shock on that one and bummed that there was no discount for guests.  Parking was free but there was a resort fee that was $50/day so it kinda squelched my inner "SCORE!" about the parking.  Overall, I'd probably rather stay somewhere more intimate next trip but the HRC is a good 'Welcome to Las Vegas' experience :-)
Hello,. . I'd like to take a minute and express my frustration over the obligatory "resort fee" charged by the Had Rock. . . The services provided by the fee are ridiculous. . . Free local calls = silly I have a mobile phone. . Free long distance = silly I have a mobile phone. . Free Internet = silly I have a mobile phone . . Access to the workout facility = yeah, it was busy every time I passed by it. The notion of charging extra for something that is included as part of the room price is dumb. . . I don't recall being charged a pillow fee, a blanket fee, or a a charge for soap I didn't use. That's a good idea though. You should charge me for soap I don't use and call it a sanitation fee. . . Moreover, the design of the showers in our room doesn't appear to be well thought out in that the water must be turned on while one is standing directly in the path if the water. . . . . Beyond this ridiculousness of the fee, we had a good time. The gaming tables are well served and dealers are friendly. DrInks were a bit over priced. . . We did appreciate the bedding and pillows. The A/C took a while to make it palatable for sleep - and I am glad we stayed in the winter time frame as it doesn't appear reasonable the A/C could keep up with this in the summer time. . . All in all, please know that this fee will ultimately precent me from staying or playing with you again. I know you'll say that my choices are limited for your services in Las Vegas - but I'll take my chances that I can find a place to stay and play somewhere else.
I don't go to Las Vegas very often, typically only once a year or so. But when I do I always go to the Hard Rock Hotel.. . The sheets are always clean and soft, the toiletries are always in their place, the amenities are fantastic (especially the pools), and there's almost no reason to ever leave. Some of the best restaurants in town are either in the hotel or within walking distance. We typically eat at the steakhouse in the Hard Rock and I have nothing but good things to say about it as well.. . I highly recommend staying at this location whenever you get a chance.. . I had the pleasure of meeting Matthew Baird, the guest relations manager during my last trip, and he completely affirmed all of my feeling about this hotel by making me feel very welcome and providing a personal touch whenever needed. I can guarantee with good people like Matthew working for this hotel I will continue to come back for years.
This 2 star rating is actually generous! The casino is super small and offers a very limited number of games and slots. The slots are old and besides the decent music, there is little to no energy in the place. I am a local and this would be the last hotel i would visit off strip.
Nothing special. Not nearly as nice as Hard Rock Hollywood/Fort Lauderdale. Good casino to lose at machines. Nobody seemed to be winning. Def not me. It's more like a long hallway than an open casino. Not impressed.
Stayed for the Thanksgiving weekend Thursday/Friday nights 2014.  Check in/checkout couldn't have been smoother...they even let us check in early and waived the usual fee.  Parking was a a breeze, the casino was cool, and the drinks were great.  The only bad thing that happened was the drunken moron in the room next door had a drunken yelling match with his girlfriend that spilled out into the hallway and woke us up (this is for you in room 325, you jerk). We never did get back to sleep.  I spoke with a manager (thank you, Christian, Ryan) and asked for a refund for just the one night, as I felt this was reasonable. He went above and beyond and actually got us a FULL refund for both nights.   Customer service here is top-notch and the refund was the deal-breaker or deal-maker for future stays.  We will be back in summer...can't wait to check out the pools.  Thanks, Hard Rock!
All style and no substance. . Starting at practically $200/night (on their site, on a concert night- there are deals to be had but far from good ones IMO), the rooms here best be swanky- and they are. But given the location, there's really nothing nearby to go to other than the businesses inside this casino unless you have a car or want to constantly call taxis. I'd rather stay on the Strip proper given this alternative, and I'm not a fan of the Strip in the first place.. . I came here for a concert, and the Joint venue here is a good one- but after visiting not one, not two, but THREE different restaurants (happy hour, dinner, and coffee), I was underwhelmed by the both the service and product at all of them, I can't really recommend this place, even for a staycation.. . Also note their insane "outside food policy"- if this were genuinely intended for safety, they would be targeting coolers, alcohol, and possible ways of bringing in drugs. Not confiscating candy bars and bottled water.
First time staying here for the Las Vegas Bowl between CSU and Utah. Was really impressed when we came in that the staff were wearing CSU gear and there were signs all over the place saying welcome. Trying to stay objective here, but please note you will constantly hear planes flying overhead. The flight path at take off goes directly over this hotel. Bring earplugs or drink alot so you don't hear it. Was woke up every morning at 6am by the wonderful sound of jack hammering due to the construction going on. My wife had a great time at the spa. Pink Taco was good. Mr Lucky's was way too expensive for eggs and coffee. The room was decent, but weirdly we had our "do not disturb" sign stolen twice? WTF? Didn't have the pleasure of the pools, but they look amazing. Not sure I will be back to stay, but definitely a party place to visit. . . Sorry, couple more things. You will need to flush the toilet about three times and the shower was cold even with putting it all the way to hot.
I read the reviews from prior people before writing this.  They must have stepped up their game, or the people writing them were diva's.  I've been through Vegas 40 or 50 times in the past 10 years and this is my first stay at the Hard Rock.  . . I won't stay anywhere else unless they give me a damn good reason to.  We stayed in the HRH tower, had the view of the planes taking off an landing, We had a King Suite for an Unbelievable price of $290 for 5 days.  The bed was UN-FRIGGING-BELIEABLE!!!  2 TV's, GREAT room service, Super cool staff except for a waiter in the Mr. Lucky's that I wanted to bitch slap.  Everyone else - regular folk who like to smile and make it happen for you.  My wife & I were not just a number.  . . It was Mrs Caruso's first time in Vegas, so we went over to the strip, up to the old part of town, and just generally had a good time, but in spite of going through all the other casino's, we'd come back to the Hard Rock and look at each other as we walked in, and said ""home".  Because it was for us.  Christina, who was our 1am casino waitress seemed to intuitively know when to chat, when to stop by to check on us, and even refused a tip with a smile, saying she was ok.  Nicole, our Check out gal, was phenominal in making everything smooth and seemless for us.  Santo's, the Valet from Melbourne was a Great reference for my wife to help illustrate some of the differences between Vegas service, & Australian service (which is almost non-existant).  My wife, is also Australian, and we currently live in Brisbane.  . . If you've made it this far in my review, you know the rest of the story.  We had a great time, it's a Great hotel, and it's made that way by the people that work there.  I highly recommend it here.  We won't be staying anywhere else.
I've never actually stayed at this hotel but I visited the casino during my last visit. There is a lot of cool stuff to look at. Made my way around the whole casino area looking at the awesome displays. The restaurants looked pretty good also. If you are looking for a cool place to stay off the strip this might be your place.
I was pretty impressed with the Hard Rock Hotel. The room decor was modern and beautiful. The room was also very clean. The price was very reasonable also.  Within the hotel are several places to eat ranging from expensive to economical.  I would stay here again.
Well the rooms are nice and same with the staff, just a little pricey when it came to the fees. Was not expecting the extra cost mostly for incidentals but you get most of it back but still not ready for it.
Great place off the strip. Shuttle hourly to fashion show mall. We didn't realize it wa s a mile off the strip, but nice place!
Nice guy at front desk upgraded us to a suite in HRH Tower. Awesome suite albeit a titch shabby but considering the color palette it's expected. Beds seem to be feather-topped, nice but a bit awkward. Very comfortable and relatively chic - suite design seems more NY than Vegas. Fu (dinner) was much better than expected. Cake at the diner was dry. Overall a high recommendation.
We checked out the casino, we didn't stay here so I don't know about the rooms. All in all its typical but with all the rock n roll memorabilia,  which is cool.
KAT WILLIAMS live.... Funny!   Funniest part of the show he got served papers on stage lol lol ...was great...venue weird...the people to escort you to your seats are all straight Rhutarded!!!!
0 stars, it is very ghetto. If you don't want to get robbed or get into a fight DON'T STEP FOOT IN THIS CASINO!! The staff is unprofessional and rude!! For the type of crowd that go to this place, there should be secure in every section of this place. It's scary and very ghetto!
If you are a business person, don't stay here. The crowd is pretty low rent, restaurants (minus NOBU) are ok at best. Thinking they have the worst/slowest internet I've ever experienced. it's actually mindblowingly slow. I give this place a C- at best.
