Excellent steak and overall experience.  Atmosphere and service are top notch.  The steak presentation during ordering is exceptional.  . . Great selection of top quality steak. Had the American Wagyu and beef wellington.  Both were mouth watering.  Well worth the money.. . I would like to see more wine selections by the glass.  The bar area is dark and intimate and has a nice selection of drink specials.  . . I recommend this as one of my favorite two top steak restaurants in Vegas.
I just wanted to update everybody.  I received an email from management asking me to contact them about what happened.  I responded via email with my phone number and never heard back from them.  . . I guess Gordon Ramsay is too busy with his fake reality shows to care about his restaurants.
We had a very nice time at Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse while we were spending a few days in Vegas. . . We started by having a few drinks at the bar while waiting for our reservation, drinks were good and satisfying to start the night. After waiting roughly 20 minutes we were seated and treated well, similar to all higher end dining, so nothing out if the ordinary. We were giving a selection of breads as an early snack while we overlooked the menu. We started off with the steak tartare, my personal favorite from most top tier steakhouses and I wasn't let down by the one served here. It was presented on a played covered in a small glass top that was  smoked to add a bit of flavor to the meat. Overall very good. For our main courses I ordered the bone in ribeye rare, which came out perfectly to my liking, and my girlfriend order the famous Wellington, which I honestly thought was pretty average. We paired it with the Mac n cheese and asparagus, which both came out nicely. . . I think our bill came out to roughly $400 for two, which is a bit pricey, but it also includes drinks. . . On a side note, we had someone next to is that felt that he was on an episode of Hells Kitchen and he was Gordon himself. Yelling at the waiting, telling them the food was crap, trying to explain how to properly cook a steak in the amount of time he expected, etc.and eventually asking for a free bill. It provided some entertainment, and I'd be willing to bet it's a regular occurrence there with the whole Gordon Ramsay arrogant image.  . . Good steak, but there are better. I personally would take Mastro's over it any day of the week.
I really really wanted to be wowed by this place considering Chef Ramsey is my ultimate man crush! The ladies in front were pleasant and gave us an entrance tour of the tunnel and light on the ceiling the place was lively and looked cool.  When we sat down first off my knife was dirty but the waiter caught that while introducing himself which has never happened before and you wouldn't expect.  Servers were very nice and professional.  But the setting felt dirty.  The floors the seats everything... Maybe that's just me but after catching the dirty knife, I saw a dirty floor and crumbs in my seat.  Not what I was expecting from a $$$$ steakhouse.  My husband had the market Caesar and he couldn't eat it bc the dressing was very fishy! But again the waiter caught it and brought him another with a vinegarette this time.  For our main dish we got the beef Wellington which as u should know Is the signature Ramsey dish... But it wasn't it was good but not WOW good.  I think eating here you pay for the name... Not really the food.
Amazing decor.  We entered through a mockup of the Chunnel.. from Paris to London. We were sat in a large open space... upscale-casual, high cielings.. visible kitchen... rock music. Drink selection displayed on an I-Pad. I got the English Garden (gin, basil and cucumber). Ordered wine... Stags Leap for under $80. Meat choices come on a large cart. Delicious looking. We had the dry aged filet with creamed spinach and roasted bone marrow. It was all great... service included. .. just great. See pics.
Really nice atmosphere. Knowledgeable, personable staff. Beautiful food - I don't think anyone can doubt that.. I really enjoyed the view of the open Kitchen. Staff know they are being watched and really play up to it.. I recommend!
Maybe it's because I'm an old fogey but the frenetic music they pumped into the dining room just ruined the whole dinner.
The host was very nice and accommodating, I made my reservation two weeks in advance but my friend got stuck in traffic so I had to reschedule it to the next day- right before our show- and they squeezed us in. it was a saturday and they were packed. For sure, she made a great first impression. . . As soon as we walked through the trendy tube-like entrance that represents London underground, we felt like a celebrities walking on the red carpet. The ceiling red neon modern artwork, symbolize Chef Ramsay's hands movement while preparing his legendary beef wellington, we knew London is calling!!! . . Our server exceeded our expectations, he did demonstrate a good knowledge explaining the menu and the steak cart display for every table.  Outstanding professionalism and Sincere attentiveness. . . I got the Prime Beef Filet, tender and juicy and prepared to perfection as a slice of heaven. The best damn steak I ever ate. I accompanied my filet,with roasted okra. So delicious. The flawless presentation of my dish was impressive. The best part was the dessert, "Sticky Toffee Pudding"  Rich with date, brown sugar toffee and brown butter ice cream. Oh Lord! OVER THE TOP!!!. . Expensive restaurant but it is totally worthwhile.  With Ramsay, it's hard to go wrong. Awesome energy, tremendous service fabulous dining experience, you'll be impressed!
I chose to go here because it was ranked the #1 steakhouse in all of Las Vegas, and I would have to agree with that ranking.. . . Once you arrive at the exterior of the restaurant, which is within the Paris hotel, you'll be greeted by a group of hostesses. They escort you to the door,  which from the outside appears to be a large glass/metal tube, but once the doors open, Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse is revealed. The decor is a lot of what you would expect when you think of Hell's Kitchen. It is black, red, dark and its wonderful. It has an extremely modern British feel, and it sets the perfect tone for a memorable night out to dinner. Not one single square inch of this restaurant went without some thought put into it. Above the restaurant hangs  an art piece, constructed of neon lights, depicting Gordon Ramsay's hand movement while making Beef Wellington.. . . . The Food. . After greeting us, the waiter brought a food cart over with an assortment of all of the steak served at the restaurant. He gave us an option between a Hell's kitchen tasting menu which came with an autographed picture of Gordon Ramsay cooking, and he gave us a traditional menu. It was quite impressive. They even had Japanese Kobe available, however at $35an ounce I had to pass. I elected to have the American Kobe filet, which was well marbleized and under $80.  Next the waiter let us hold and smell a white truffle, which is an option when ordering any Ramsey steak, but at $15 a gram and a three gram minimal order, I passed.. . I did op for the second best "truffle" alternative which was macaroni and cheese cooked and white truffle oil, and it was absolutely scrumptious. When our steaks arrived, about 45 minutes after ordering, they were cooked to absolute perfection and I could not have asked for anything better. . . The wait between ordering and receiving your food however is a tad bit long, but it gives you more time to soak it all in.. . . If you're looking for a great steak and a wonderful experience and perhaps a memory that will last a lifetime, I highly recommend Gordon Ramsay's Steak, located inside the Paris Hotel Las Vegas.
The best steak ever.  Impeccable service.  Tartare is so good, it's the way beef should be eaten all the time.. . Came here during Thanksgiving weekend on our last night in Vegas.  Donnie was our server again, which was great because he is top notch along with the food.  He even remembered me and what I ordered when I came here last December.. . My wife ordered the fish and chips; she says they're the best she's ever had.  Considering she's English, I take that as high praise.. . Finished off with the sticky toffee pudding with the brown butter ice cream.  This is seriously one of the best desserts ever.. . Whenever I come to Vegas, I always make a point of coming to Gordon Ramsay Steak because everything is always perfect.
I took my boyfriend here for his birthday last Sunday and WOW, they definitely lived up to all the hype. Also such a great value for the pricing! Bill came out to around $190 before tip for two drinks, appetizer, two entrees, a side, some foie butter, and dessert! Craftsteak set me back $450 for about the same portion!. . Smoked Beef Tartare: . Lemon Zest, Red onion, Capers, White Anchovy Aioli, Cured Egg Yolks, & Yukon Gold Herb Chips. This was definitely a different twist on the many tartares I've tried. It's served with this glass bowl on top and the server takes it off to let you smell the smokiness lol, cool presentation. More chunky and citrusy than I'm used to but with every bite I liked it more and more. However, no one has yet to beat the Tartare I've had at Sage. $21. . 18 Oz Bone-In New York Strip:. Aged for 28 days in their Himilayan Salt Room. My boyfriend had this one and it was nothing short of amazing. And 18 Oz for around $60?? Wow what a great deal. It wasn't as tender as some we've had but the flavor was potent and very earthy. I definitely want to try their Japanese A5 Kobe next time. $61. . Red Wine Braised Beef Short Ribs:. I had this entree since I'm not really a steak person (I know I know, there's definitely something wrong with me lol) This was enormous. Wow, I could barely finish half of it! It was exactly the size of my forearm, and for reference, I measured my forearm for you guys and it is 9.5 inches long. The short rib was so tender it basically melt in my mouth and it was served with Potato Puree, Wild Mushrooms and Sauteed Spinach. Can I have this every cheat day please? $41. . Side of Foie Butter:. So my boyfriend likes this on this steak after first trying the combo with his Rib-Eye at Fleur in Mandalay soo he ordered some foie butter on the side here, and we were expecting a tablespoon or something but they gave us about 5 inch-thick slices served in a mini dish! Oh my gosh! We ended up putting this on everything cause we felt bad wasting and we still couldn't finish it! lol Super flavorful and rich. Only $6!. . Loaded Baked Potato:. This is basically the king of all baked potatoes. Served with Smoked Gouda Bechamel, Sour Cream, Bacon Lardons, and chives. I have no idea where they found a potato this big. It was on steroids lol and super tasty. The Smoked Gouda is what made this potato over the top. I would be surprised if this thing was under 1500 calories. $11. . Coconut Cake:. I know that everyone recommends the Sticky Toffee Pudding Pops but since he offers that at BurGR as well, we decided to try something different. Coconut Pastry Cream, Pineapple, Toasted Coquiots, with Passionfruit-Guava Sorbet. Super light and flavorful, the perfect ending to such a rich meal. $12. . I honestly think this could be in my favorite top 3 restaurants in Vegas behind Sage and Scarpetta. Again, the service in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant is beyond over the top. Everyone was super friendly, always giving more information than they really have to. Basically when I think of service, I think of Gordon Ramsay. Also, I enjoyed the ambiance in this restaurant. Everyone was talking and laughing, having a good time, with music playing in the background. I honestly hate when a restaurant is whisper quiet. I also really loved the intimate booths on the second level. Really comfortable and private while still being able to see all the action downstairs. I can't wait to come here again. Next on my list: his signature Wellington, Wagyu Carpaccio & Sliders, Kurobuta Pork Belly, Japanese A5 Kobe, or maybe I'll just attack the Tasting Menu :)
Decided to try for some last minute reservations (and by last minute, I mean a week in advance), and had to settle for a 5:00 dinner. So, word to the wise, reserve early.. . FOOD: My wife got the 8 oz filet, I got the American Kobe/Wagyu Rib Cap, and we shared Fingerling Potatoes and Mac and Cheese. The steaks tasted great. It's possible they were a little overdone compared to the temp we asked for, but still very good and tender. Mastro's is a really amazing steakhouse in LA, and I don't know if this is necessarily up to par, but it's close, and for those of you that have been to Mastro's, being "close" means a lot. The fingerling potatoes were a bit salty if eating them with the steak. The Mac and Cheese, however, was perfect. It had a very good truffle flavor, but it wasn't overpowering. The bread that came out was probably the best free bread you could ever have at a restaurant...creative, tasted great, gourmet bread (is that even a real thing?). . . SERVICE: I would say the service was very good. It wasn't anything extraordinarily great, but it was good. I did like the steak presentation. They roll out the cart with the various steaks, and they actually take the time to go over each cut which is really informative and helpful in making a decision. . . AMBIANCE: It's a relatively casual place, which some reviewers have complained about. But hey, it's Vegas! Some people spend the day in shorts and sandals gambling, and then head to a nice dinner. Some people dress up for a nice dinner, then go to a show or out to a club. There's a variety of customers and I think at a Vegas restaurant, casual dress/dining at a fancy restaurant is no problem. . . This is also one of those places where they pay very close attention to detail. As we were eating, the table next to us was being set up, and they were measuring the distance from the table to the booth, etc.. . All in all, a great experience, and great food. Would I go back? Surely.
This place is way too loud.. . They clearly have "vibe" and "cochlear damage" confused.  So, if you have the "ear thing" like me and millions of other Americans I strongly suggest other digs or at least ear plugs. I wanted the Ramsey experience so I opted for the plugs and sat down.. . The service was OK, a little slow but courteous. The place is very touristy, I hate that people dress so poorly anymore... Anyway the food was good, not the greatest ever, but good. Not worth the $400 you're going to drop for two people. . . Did I mention this place was way, way, way too loud? I like the 70's British punk/pop music, just not at brain damage decibel. If you have hearing issues use care. You'll be sorry if you don't. . . Oh, did I mention this place is way too freaking loud? In case I didn't I'll mention it again. THIS PLACE IS WAY TOO LOUD.. . Glad I ate here, but unlikely that I'll return. . . Oh, and this place is way too loud. Did I mention that?
My wife and I decided to have dinner here for our anniversary.  Let me start off by saying that this restaurant is not the best establishment for that romantic evening your searching.  The music is incredibly loud ( as you can see from other posts about this restaurant) and it's difficult to hold a conversation without yelling.  Request the second floor...it's much quieter.  From a food standpoint it was good.  Nothing incredibly special but good.  Star of the night was the charred octopus and fingerling salad.  From the allure standpoint of Gordon Ramsay being a celebrity chef, the restaurant is what it's trying to accomplish...a tourist destination..  From a service standpoint it felt very impersonal.  To robotic with lack of emotion.  . In summary it felt like you were at a night club that sells food.
More like a 4 1/2. . . Took my boyfriend here for his birthday, I made reservations 3 weeks in advance and I still didn't get the time I wanted! LOL, I wanted to do 8:00 but they only had 5:00PM or 8:15PM of course I choose the 8:15. . . . Arrived right on time for dinner, we were sat upstair right in front of the red crazy ball light thingy hahaha. BEST VIEW EVER! I recommend to have a seat upstairs. . . Free bread! - If your server has to explain to you want kind of bread you're eating that means it's GOOD! Best free bread ever. . . Bone in Rib eye - YUMMM, can I tell you it's better than Mastros?? So sorry! The meat was juicy and that sauce on the meat perfect! . . Duet of Lamb - This was pretty good! I always order lamb, wish they gave out more pieces though... it was only two piece for the same price I could have got a whole rack like Mastros. BUT THE SAUCE ON IT YUMMY! This meal also came with the shepherd pie  not bad a little salty.  . . Two side - Mac n Cheese/ Asparagus ( We really wanted Brussels sprouts but they were not in season boo-hoo. ) Both side were amazing though! Compare to Mastros/ Ruth Chris. . . Drinks! - I had a cocktail mix with fruits super yummy. Boyfriend got the angry orchid cider. . . Service - WONDERFUL! Until the end of the meal it's like they completely forgot about us lol, I really wanted to surprise my boyfriend with a dessert so I ask them to bring out the Bread pudding in the end in the reservation... but they didn't.. so I was kind of mad because of that.. could have been five star.
Excellent service and the food is even better. Awesome place. This is my second time second year and it not disappointing.
Lively atmosphere, outstanding service, sticky toffee pudding is one of the best desserts I have eaten in my life! Only letdown was the NY strip, which while well cooked was chewy with lots of sinews.
My wife and I were really looking forward to trying a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype.. . They've got a silly iPad drink menu that they bring around to you when you are first seated.  Unfortunately it does not work AT ALL.  When browsing it the app locked up on us and crashed twice.  The table next to us chimed in "yeah, that happened to us too" and the table on the other side said the same thing.  After they left and someone new sat down at their table, they also had problems with the app.  So 4 out of 4 of us had problems.  If this happened to Gordon on Restaurant Nightmares I can just picture him screaming at the GM "what were you thinking you donkey!"  Lame.. . The food was decent, but not amazing.  The portions are huge to match the also huge prices.  Dinner for 2 for my wife and I was $170.  Overall it was fine, but it's no better than any other decent Vegas steak house, but here you're paying a premium for the Ramsay name.. . Overall, the only amazing thing was the sticky toffee pudding.  I don't even have the words to describe how delicious this was.  Unfortunately that was the only stand out part of the evening.  Skip Gordon Ramsay Steak and get the sticky toffee pudding at his pub or burger restaurant across the street.
We come here not only for the steak, but also for the experience. And boy, you do get what you pay for. The cuts presentation and the Ipad menu was nice, but nothing impressive. The food was great. I got the American Kobe/Wagyu Rib Cap, and my husband got a Porterhouse.. . Up to this point, the experience didn't stand out from all the fine dinning experience in Vegas. Then the Fingerling Potatoes came out..... . We were not happy with the potatoes because it had something that my husband is allergic on top, which we repeatedly told our waiter to leave out. Before we had the chance to talk to the waiter, the manager ran over and checked on us, he asked about the potatoes and instantly replaced it as our request.. . We were really impressed since we didn't even have a second to feel displeased with our meal, the manager was so quick. I was sure that his job is standing around, and looking at people facial expression, to make sure that everyone is happy. . . To top off everything, we have the Sticky Toffee. This is a must-have when you are here.
Another night in Vegas, another wonderful steakhouse.  Gordon Ramsay steak is one of the newer upscale steakhouses in Vegas and is located conveniently in the center of the strip at the Paris hotel.  I have eaten at some of the other Gordon Ramsay eateries in Vegas and neither of them compare to this one.  In fact, very few steakhouses on the strip compare to this.  The decor, the service, and the food are all fantastic.. . We first started with some drinks, bread (some of the best free bread around) and the seafood platter for 4.  This was one of the best tasting seafood platters I have had.  Everything was fresh and came with a variety of sauces which were amazing.  The crab and lobster was especially tasty. . . After the starter, I ordered the salmon and the table also shared a porterhouse.  The salmon was very good, and actually a very good portion size.  Normally they make the salmon with a cauliflower puree that when you squeeze lemon over it, it turns purple, but I think they did a seasonal vegetable with it this time (which stayed one color).  The porterhouse was as good as it gets.  Nothing to fancy on the cook, just a very flavorful and moist steak.  Make sure to get a few extra bites off the bone, that's where you get some of the best meat bites.  . . The spinach at GR is also one of the best sides I've ever had.  Just a great blend of garlic and oil to make the spinach super tasty and not too drenched.  . . For desert I tried the peanut butter bar.  Very good, but nothing amazing.. . Overall, one of my favorite meals in Vegas.
I've been here only twice but both experiences were orgasmic.  My boyfriend and I ordered two bone in rib eyes with foie gras, shitake mushrooms, cocktail shrimp for our appetizer and the toffee pudding dessert.  The dessert was supposedly rated dessert of the year and I believe it!  Everything was so delicious!  . . We ordered the steak medium rare plus, it was cooked perfectly.  . . Just be prepared to be waiting a while before you get your food, especially your main entrees.  But it is def worth the wait!  Oh and another warning...you will also have major food coma.
Ah, we were SO EXCITED to eat here.  Big Ramsay fans, but more importantly, we love food and couldn't wait to experience this place.  In short, it was good, but not amazing, and I'll give more detail below.. . We had a 7 pm reservation, and checked in at 6:55.  We were told it would be a few more minutes but to "please take a seat at the bar and we'll come find you when you're table is ready."  So, we head in through the tube-like entrance into a PACKED bar, with no where to sit, and not even anywhere to stand.  We poked around and debated ordering a drink, but decided not to because we thought we'd be seated soon.  So back into the smoky, loud casino we went to wait.  And wait.  Aaaaaand wait.  Not a bench or a chair in sight, we stood and waited for nearly 30 minutes for our table.  Pretty disappointing given we had a reservation.. . We were seated and greeted by our server, who presented us with an iPad to look at drinks.  Kinda gimicky, but ok.  We ordered drinks and then he disappeared for a long time, returning with the "meat trolley."  Unfortunately we already had looked at the menu while he was gone, and knew what we wanted, but then we had to sit through a 10 minute meat presentation before even ordering a starter.  Now it's almost 8, and we haven't had a bite to eat.  . . We ordered the pork belly and sliders to start, which came promptly after a nice bread selection.  The pork belly was very good, but lacked salt, and the sliders were better.  We ordered a signature Wellington to share, and were talked into ordering a side with it, which ended up being WAY too much food.  The Wellington was a bucket list item for me, and I was so excited for it, but it was just ok.  The steak was amazingly tender, but needed more seasoning and the pastry and duxel were borderline flavorless.  For $55 for an 8 oz portion, it was underwhelming at best.  We didn't touch the potato side because with 2 starters, bread, and a Wellington, we were stuffed!  The portions here are pretty hefty, so don't be coerced into ordering more than you need.. . My hubby ordered a second beer from our waiter's "helper" and when it came he was surprised at how hoppy it was.  He drank it, but when we got the bill it had a completely different beer with "Hoppy" in the name instead of what my hubby ordered.  Pretty weak for a fancy place.. . The best part of the visit was probably the ambiance, I loved the dining room with the Union Jack ceiling! They managed to make an upscale steakhouse into a "fun" environment which was refreshing for sure.  It felt a great balance of casual and fancy.. . In all, we're glad we came, but I wish it was better.  The service could use some work, and the food could use some seasoning.  It would be nice to bring bread and/or let guests order starters before presenting the "meat trolley." Our bill was $155 for a cocktail, 2 beers, 2 starters, a shared steak and a side dish.  Pretty comparable to most Vegas restaurants, but we still feel like the experience was just "ok."
We weren't happy with our initial dining experience there and wrote about it (see my last review). To our surprise, one of the Gordon Ramsay Steak managers contacted us soon thereafter to invite us back for another dining experience, promising to make things right.  Challenge accepted! . . For appetizer, we got complementary scotch eggs that were lightly battered and deep fried; when we cut inside, the egg yolk was still running! yum! . . We also ordered oysters and clams, yeah yeah yeah, i know it's a steak house but we felt like having some shellfish for the night. They had a wide variety from the East to the West coast and were so fresh and full of favor! . . The Wagyu beef slider was out of this world!  It was so juicy and perfectly cooked.  I can see myself coming back here and ordering 5 of them at the same time! Pork belly was oh so crispy on the skin side with perfect layering of fat on the inside it literally melted inour mouths with the first bite! .  . The Rib cap and the bone-in ribeye were some of the best steaks we have ever had! For sides, we had bone marrow & shitaki mushrooms, however, the bone marrow was a bit too gamy for our taste and i wouldn't recommend it. I had tried bone marrow before at Animal restaurant in LA and it wasn't gamy at all. The shitaki mushroom was on point though.. . Our server, Matthew, also one of their managers, oversaw our entire dinner, and his professionalism was beyond reproach. This time Gordon Ramsay Steak redeemed itself and was deserving of the namesake.  We have many family members and friends visiting from out-of-town year round. As hosts, we wanna be able to impress them with the best dining experience Las Vegas has to offer, and I think I can finally count on GRS to provide a boat load of it.
The single most incredible dining experience. EVER!  Every aspect of this restaurant screams perfection... The staff is professional but interacts with the guests in a warm and friendly manner, making you feel like you're the most important customer in the dining room.  The utmost care and precision is used in the placement and removial of every item on the table, from flatware to glasses.  The manner in which they conduct themselves is second to none, rivaling only their appearance, which is also impeccable.  Now onto the food:  Everything food item was beyond our expectations.  Absolute perfection.  Worth every penny and we'll be talking about this meal until we meet again next year!  Alex our server,  was excellent, as was every employee we encountered that evening.  Bravo Chef Ramsay!  Bravo!!!
We had a large group of 16 at 2 tables and added 2 more at the last minute.  They were very accommodating by splitting the bill several.ways.  The food was delicious, steaks cooked perfectly and the A5 Wagyu beef was mouth watering tender.  The seafood tower starter was a hit as well as the sticky toffee pudding which was way better than one we had at another restaurant.  Our favorite sides were mashed potatoes, asparagus and okra.. . The wine list was very good and we enjoyed the Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc and Sea Smoke 10 Pinot Noir.  Best Pinot I ever had were 2 comments.. . It was pricey but well worth the experience as it was our grandsons pre-wedding dinner.  . . We will be back.
Being a fan of Hell's Kitchen, I had to see how good Chef Ramsey's food is because the show sometimes makes the mouth water.. . All I can say is GOD DAMN CHEF RAMSEY!!!!!. . We went to Gordon Ramsey Steak in Paris thinking it was going to be a long wait.  Not at all.  They recommend you have a reservation but you can also eat in the lounge and still have access to the same menu.. . Let's start with the service.  Our host was on point.  Never once did our drinks get low, she was literally at our beckon call and the place was packed.. A+. . Food was off the chain.  We ordered the Bone in ribeye, Beef Wellington for two and a side of Mac & Cheese.  The wellingtons were perfect and lived up to the expectation you see in Hell's Kitchen.  The bone in ribeye was so juicy and cooked perfectly (medium).  I took a star for the Mac and Cheese because the blue cheese is overpowering.  It's seasoned well but leaves more to be desired if your a real cheese head.. . We were too stuffed to even try desert.  Overall food experience was fantastic.
Being a very big Gordon Ramsay fan my husband and I finally went to dine there. We were greeted by 3 lovely hostesses and taken to our seat immediately . Our server came within five minutes. Our server was attentive until we ordered, my husband wanted the taster menu and I did not he said we had to both order it, that I don't understand, so we couldn't get it, my husband was very disappointed , and only for a mere $145. I got the lobster app $28 it had a nice tasting sauce but could not cut the lobster, my husband got the octopus salad which I loved. The Mac and cheese was tasteless I took one bite and so did my husband, ugh. The beef Wellington was really good it would have been fantastic if it was not room temp and my tuna was ok. I expected an OHHHHH MY GOD  experience and was very disappointed . Would not have my friends go.
Incredible! The only reason it's not 5 stars, is the noise level over all, for me. It's great for most. If you like a quiet atmosphere, ask for a seat at one of tables by the wine case. It's tucked away in the back. I had the Himalayan salt room filet and my son had the Colby beef filet. Mouthwatering! Worth every penny.
We did the Gordon Ramsay Steak for our Wedding Anniversary. My wife has been wanting to try out Gordon Ramsay Beef Wellington as it has been the main signature dish for Gordon Ramsay. The entrance was great, they call it thechunnel which was supposed to be an ode to the connection between France and UK Channel + tunnel although I dont understand why the chandeliers had to be explained by the servers. Anyway on to the food. Since we are asian we are used to the beef being well done the rarest we would go for is medium. Beef wellington comes only medium rare. My wife went ahead and ordered the beef wellington and the taste was pretty good expectation were definitely met. The beef wellington was consumed in a few short minutes :).  I on the other had the 24 oz steak which is good. I should have tried the Wagyu version since I can cook the steaks I should have gotten something that I cant get at home although the meat was aged 28 days the taste is the same as the aged beef in Whole Foods or from our local butcher shop. The Service was very good which is expected since it is an expensive restaurant. The sides were great we had the octopus Remoulade salad which was done very well, octopus if cooked long becomes tough in Gordon Ramsay Steak it was soft.    The mac and Cheese with truffle butter was REALLY good I like the idea that the twist was using truffle oil in the mac and cheese and it tasted really good. We will definitely try other things on the menu if we decide to go on another dinner date at Gordon Ramsay Steak.
Came here for my brothers birthday and honestly, the best piece of steak I have ever had. Unfortunately I wasnt able to try the beef wellington as it has bacon wrapped, but I am so glad I didnt because it made me order the Rib Cap and that was the BEST piece of meat I have ever eaten. It was soft, juicy, tender, flavorful and the perfect size- not too big and not too small where I wanted more. To accompany the steak, we shared mac&cheese, baked potato and a side of asparagus. The sides were good but nothing to rave about. . . Counting the days I go back to Vegas so I can eat the Rib Cap at Gordon Ramsay again!
Went there for my Husbands birthday on 12/16 and the food was not as good as the first time we went in January 2014.  The soup was cold, the shitake mushroon side taste like soy sauced mushrooms and the American cap was flavorful but was tough. 5 star is for the American Kobe, mac and cheese and the French Press coffee (Yumo).  We really like the service and hope the next time we go to Vegas, the food will be as good as the first time.
After watching a ton of his shows on TV, I've been wanting to try some of his signature items to see if he lives up to his reputation.. . This is one of his Vegas flagships. It was my first time here but hubby had been here before and loved it. Trendy decor and cute story about going through the Chunnel from Paris to London when you're being seated.. . Excellent service at the table! The hostesses aren't the most consistent, but the table service is excellent. Nice explanation of the menu and steak cuts.. . These are the highlights and what I would definitely recommend getting:. - Beef Wellington - it's the signature item and sooo good. The layers are perfect and the meat inside is incredibly flavorful. - Sticky toffee pudding - another classic dish that totally lived up to the hype. Definitely good for sharing after a big meal.. . Bread service is lovely with a nice variety to choose from, and we also enjoyed the salad to start (not unique, but a nice starter if you need vegetables).  The Mac and cheese side is totally the way to go with your steak.  Rich and creamy with a good firmness to the pasta.. . Solid 4 stars and worth a stop if you're in Vegas!. . Dinner runs about $100 pp without alcohol.
The service was amazing, we were well taken care of and the menu was explained very well. We ordered the pork belly as an appetizer which was delicious. My wife ordered the Filet and I ordered the new york strip, both were very tastey. We order the truffled potatoes as a side which was pretty good. You might be wondering why I am giving it a one star if the food and service were so good. Well that night my wife and I were both extremely sick. We fasted all day to enjoy the food so I am certain we were sick from Gordon Ramsay Steak. We were up all night in the bathroom and are still feeling the effects two days later. To think that I paid 200 dollars to get sick leaves me very upset. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I knew it would be a little over priced just because it had Gordon Ramsay's name attached but paying that much money to get sick is just unacceptable.
Went on 12/14/14 for my birthday dinner. The place is amazing. The service was top notch by all the servers. We got oysters and the Maine lobster for appetizers. Baked potato for side and I got rib eye for the main. Everything was as described and tasted great. This place is a little pricey  but worth every penny. I recommend everybody to try this at least once
This is by far our fav in Vegas!! Hubby melts for the chorizo stuffed lobster tail and the short rib entree. I had the Wellington. They were so good that when we came here again a year later we got the same things !!  So good and the service is wonderful!! Love it!! Our Go to spot for Vegas vacation !!!
Had the bone in rib eye which was very good and big. Wife ordered the beef Wellington and probably the best thing I have ever tasted. Nice restaurant and fun experience. Can't wait to come back.
OMG, did you know that light fixture on top of the ceiling is Gordon Ramsay's hand movements while he makes the famous Beef Wellington? I'm being sarcastic. I guess it's a creative piece of art, but seems somewhat too abstract to awe at. When the hostess pointed it out before we sat down, I think she expected us to look up and be amazed at his delicate/intentional hand movements to procure his famous Beef Wellington.. . Anyway, we went with the Foie Gras for an appetizer, the American Cap, and the Beef Wellington. Foie Gras will always be good--was happy to have it since it was banned in the state of California a couple years ago. The American Cap was juicy, fatty, and tasty (highly recommended). The Beef Wellington was good but nothing life-changing, I mean with those hand movements outlined on the ceiling light fixture, I should've better appreciate the countless hours Mr. Ramsay spent to perfect his art (sarcasm).. . I otherwise had a really good experience here and had fun laughing at Gordon Ramsay's hand movement light fixture. Service was excellent and everything was elegant from the placemats to the uniforms of the wait staff.. . I highly recommend checking this place out for an extraordinary dinner.

Their Kobe stake melts in your  mouth...absolutely phenomenal....loved loved loved their truffle fries! Great drinks, wonderful service. I will definitely stop here again next time I'm in town.
We started with half-dozen oysters, which were fat and flavorful. Our party ordered the ribeye, Kobe filet, and the ribcap. The ribeye was huge and the ribcap melts in your mouth. The filet was a good balance of fat and texture. Our sides were asparagus, creme corn, mac and cheese, and fingerling potatoes. We had one tough asparagus and the corn had a bit too much bourbon. Otherwise, the sides were good. For dessert, we had the toffee pudding cake and the peanut chocolate bar. The toffee date cake was as good as others have mentioned and the peanut chocolate bar was super rich. I think there should be complementary coffee for that dessert. The highlight of the meal was the staff. They were attentive, patient, and funny, without being overbearing. They made the meal all the more special. This was the evening of December 23, 2014.
It was a great experience! I had to make a reservation a month before though. What i thought was weird was that they gave us an ipad to buy drinks, i was like what the heck...just give us the damn menu, the waiters did spend  a lot of time explaining the different cuts of meat, but that didn't bother me, but it took a good amount of time. .      I ordered the beef wellington, the pork belly appetizer and for dessert, the sticky toffee pudding. I can't explain how good the food was.  It was just amazing.

Ever since I started watching Hell's Kitchen and Master Chef, I've wanted to come to one of Gordon's restaurants. This place is wonderful!-I mean, really it's all dat!!! and some! It deserve more like a 4.5-the steak could of taste better and it should have been warmer! But....The service-impeccable! The decor-trendy with a classy twist. The food-Great presentation, good food but the steak could have been seasoned little better! The Price-expensive!!!. . **Note: If you are dating someone that is amazing and you really love them then this is the place to take them for an upscale, intimate and romantic anniversary dinner! I wouldn't waste my money coming here if you are just dating causally!!!. . So, check it...I ordered the  rib-eye steak, good butneeded A-1 sauce, I had a side of mac and cheese-super tasty. I also ordered the Foie Gras, which was the best that I ever had-amazing! Oh! you have to try their iced teas-bottled passion fruit green tea or their the black sage ice tea-So darn good!!! You know, a lot of people really enjoy their toffee pudding BUT I didn't care for it, however, the presentation of the Desserts were great! I'll be back for the Beef Wellington!
The cocktail menu is worth exploring. Pims lemonade was very fruity yet balanced with fresh herbs. Delicious
