Food is good, but there is nothing amazing about it. Good for its atmosphere. Great place for a date. Little pricey as is everything decent on the strip though.
The desserts at Serendipity are worth a visit alone - simply incredible.  My only complaint is Serendipity gets very busy when The Strip loads up and wait times get long.  But, that's because it's a great restaurant worth waiting for.
The most rude service I have ever had. Now the food is amazing but the service is horrible. First the host was so rude and up tight. She made my husband and I wait an hour for a table when our friends had gotten a table already and had extra chairs that we could have sat on but she said no to that idea. I had heard amazing comments about the food so decided to stay. My husband on the other hand was very upset and starving. Just ruined the whole morning for us. BTW her name of the host was Gretel. She shouldn't be working there if she doesn't like her job or customer service.
I came here with high expectations, but was extremely disappointed. Don't come here for food. Dessert is the only highlight.. . My boyfriend ordered the nachos. They were okay, nothing to rave about. I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad and it was horrible. I think I only had 2 bites of it. The chicken was slimy and weird.. . Portions are big. Unless you're dying of starvation, just split ameal. It will save you a lot of money. . . There was only one positive and that was the frozen hot chocolate. We had it with pinnacle vodka. It was very good. Again, this is something you should share. It was very big.. . Prices are ridiculous. You get $1 off with your Total Rewards card, but let's be real - $1 off doesn't really make much of a difference.. . Service was mediocre. . . I would come back here again, but only for hot chocolate/dessert.
You go to this restaurant for the experience and the desserts.  Not the regular food.  The desserts are generous and wonderful.  The frozen hot chocolate is just that - someone took hot chocolate and froze it.  It's not outstanding.  But the sundaes LOOK amazing.  I wasted my dessert portion on the frozen hot chocolate.  Also, I got a burger that was just meh.  I've had better at Carls jr. and certainly cheaper.  . It's a beautiful location and worth the trip, but just get dessert.  Oh and the outside walk up option is probably even better.  We waited nearly 30 minutes for a table.
It can be a long wait sometimes, but they are able to text you when your table is ready. Warning though, they will only hold your table for 5 minutes. This place is really famous for their Frozen Hot Chocolate. I've tried their coffee flavored and i have to say it was pretty good. The prices can be a bit high, but you are in Las Vegas so it'll always be high (think of how much the Starbucks is across the street). I got their grilled cheese with tomato soup and that was delicious. So was their chicken strips, but when you think about it, you can probably get that somewhere else for a cheaper price. It's the ambience, location, and that frozen hot chocolate that you're kind of paying for. I recommend that you have a Total Rewards card because there is a discount for that. Enjoy the that Frozen Hot Chocolate!!!
I had just seen a show at Caesars and decided to go to Serendipity 3 and do "Grab-N-Go". (This is the outside walkup window not the inside sit down restaurant). . Bacon Cheeseburger, fries and soda. . The price of $16.22 is fair considering it is Las Vegas.. . All food is cooked to order. The burger was cooked fine.  The bacon tasted like it was in a prep pan for hours.  I have worked in a hotels and kitchens for almost 30 years and I know lame bacon when I taste it.. . The fries were the highlight of the meal. . . The order taker was pleasant and efficient.  'Wait for your soda ... your number will be called at the other window ... thank you'.   Again ... pleasant.. . Major issue: The customers can see into the kitchen and service areas.  You can see when your order is complete.  You can see your order sit under the heat lamp while the girl expediting and making drinks is TEXTING!  My number was called and my order was placed on the counter.  No "thank you" ... no "enjoy your meal" ... no "please come again". . Within a 10 minute walk north or south on "The Strip" there are two burger places ... "Stripburger" and "Fat Burger" both have better burgers and service.  . . If you see a show at Caesars ... and you want a burger afterwards ... take the 10 minute walk ... skip Serendipity 3.. .

Had brunch with my new friend, Judy. As always the food was tasty. But I went for the Frozen Hot Chocolate. Ordered one for 2 to go and though it was the size of my head, I  loved every drop!
Great location!. It's a fantastic spot overlooking the strip! It's also surrounded by Caesars gardens which are stunning! The place is very playful and it had Alice in Wonderland touches. We sat outside on a cold evening but with the heat lamps going it was perfect. I ordered hot chocolate because of the cold night and it was not as decadent as I hoped it would be. It tasted like something I can put together at home and I was looking for more. . Several food items were ordered that were ok. I tasted the chili which was too thick for my taste and the triple grilled cheese sandwich was huge. It was ok but nothing special. The best part of the meal was the creamy tomato bisque. . This location is known for its sweets and the menu has lots to choose from. We ordered a small sundae and it was still huge! I did taste it and the hot fudge was great! . Overall a fun experience with the outside location and the service was great. The food can use some work.... Spend the money on more quality ingredients and the ratings shall improve.
Does not give military discounts only if your a total rewards member. Sounds backwards to me.
Great food, horrible service! Woman was rude to me and my family and when we asked about military discount she looked at us and said no we don't do that. Only their "total rewards" customers!
The hosts are stupid. They can't work for crap. They have people waiting for min 40 + min (saturday).. when tables are obviously empty and clean. And I was standing right by the host table and I noticed the two hosts were telling literally every party that the wait is 40 min. Lolol.. . My party and I had been waiting for 40+ minutes. Half the time in the freezing cold outside cuz they told us to wait outside then the other half inside because it was way too cold and wasn't going to stay outside any longer. Then all of a sudden a party of 2 shows up saying they have reservations at 5pm (Note: it was 4pm). The host picks up 2 menu and seats them right away. This was right after i was told id be seated next. Wth?!?  They made reservation for 5pm... not 4pm. Without hesitation the dumb host didn't think to consider the people who had been waiting and just seated those people. So of course I complained to the other host. And she said yeah I just realized that.. I'll tell her. But yeah nothing could be done because they had already seated them. I was hungry, cold, cranky, and not having it.. . Plus the food was not worth it and overpriced but it's vegas so it's expected. But just as people expect vegas to be overpriced simply because it's vegas.. we expect the service to be at least decent because it's vegas. You know?. . The only thing I enjoyed was the macchiato  frozen hot chocolate.. . . I will never be going there again unless I was craving their frozen hot chocolate and the wait is 10 min max cuz like I said earlier it's not worth it.. . Their management is so unprofessional. The 2 hosts were talkingbadly about the manager and how he/she comes in whenever he/she wants.. I mean that's your opinion and you have the right to say what you want but c'mon... you have customers.. like 15 of them standing in the front waiting to be seated and you're talking badly about your manager? So unprofessional. Hosts are the face of a restaurant.. the first impression and i have to say they were the worst. . . The server was nice but dumb as well. I noticed total reward members receive discount.. so I asked him if I could just give my total rewards # to be used towards the bill and he said he'll get it from it after the meal when he brings me bill. Well.... yeah its my fault I forgot to mention it or remind him when I received the bill but if he's the one that told me he'll do it after.. thenn shouldn't he be responsible for asking for it again when he gives me the bill? I could've saved around $10 but ... nope. . . I would expect more from a restaurant that is associated with Caesars palace.
The food here is ok. The Wagyu sliders were really good. Wouldn't recommend the grilled cheese though. The service is pretty bad, had a hard time getting a hold of the waitress. The decor is like McDonald's, and the tables are stained and dirty. The frozen hot chocolate was ok. Nothing was worth the money except the sliders. Save your money and try another place.
Bartender super unfriendly, Rhonda was her name. Said tourists ask too many questions. Had nachos they were ok. Customer service horrible.
We arrived around 11pm and we were seated pretty much immediately however, our table top had spilled coffee and food on it, the chairs also had drinks spilled on them, and the floor under our table also had food on it. We asked the hostess for someone to clean the table we waited standing around our table for almost 10 mins, when no one came we cleaned it ourselves with the napkins on the table . Our server wasn't really friendly at all. We were a party of six ppl they brought out food for only two ppl while the rest of us waited another 25-30 mins for our food. the food was ok. We ordered omelets and burgers our food wasn't even hot when received it. Dirty restaurant, ok service and alright food, I won't be back.
Such an awesome dessert place, ugh. Came here about two summers ago when my friends and I headed over to Las Vegas for EDC and I still crave it from time to time.. The Frozen Hot Chocolate and the Strawberry Fields Sundae were to die for, especially in the scorching Vegas heat. . Can't really say much for the actual food though. I stopped by once for breakfast after the event and all my friends agreed that it was pretty mediocre for the price, nothing special. . Overall, I've always heard great things about Serendipity's infamous Frozen Hot Choco and I have to confirm that it's a must try (especially during the summer)!!
We had chicken strips. It was, to me, actually pretty good. For a place thats known for their dessert.I wasnt having high hopes for their regular food menu, but to my surprise, it was good! The batter was perfect! Of course, we couldnt leave the place without having a frozen hot chocolate. That was amazing as well.. . As a first timer, this place is definitely worth the try. Only downfall to this place, half the inside was not even filled, yet we still waited about 45 mins to be seated. It was terrible. Maybe short staff? Other than the long wait, everything was great, and reasonable price!
Only had dessert.  I had a regular caramel sundae and my friend had the frozen hot chocolate.  The sundae was good with lots of caramel and my friend said she really liked the hot chocolate.  3 stars mainly because 1) it was good but nothing spectacular 2) $12 bucks for plain a sundae is ridiculous 3) the service was lacking.  We had to flag down someone twice to ask if we had a waiter.  The place was busy but not too crazy, since we were seated immediately.  When the waiter finally showed up he was very nice and apologetic which was appreciated.  But it seemed like they needed more staff for a Sunday at 7pm.
Pretty cool spot.  Reminds me of a silver diner and for that I enjoyed the place.  I didn't get the memo about the big shakes but we got our food and was plenty shocked.  Fries were disapointing as we just wanted to get fries and a shake.  Overall we had a great experience and would return.
Every time we go to Vegas, this is a stop... There is nothing like their Frozen Hot Chocolate.... . I would give this 5 stars but I just cant get over the fact that I spend $10 for 8oz of frozen hot chocolate... For as much business as they get for it, maybe one day they will lower their pricing some to entice more return visits during vacationers trips.... . Super delicious though!
Waited long line for hot chocolate!! Theyre sold out! We got frozen hot chocolate instead even though its cold. Then we got a frozen corndog too...Very disappointing. Service is okay not friendly understaffed.
Serendipity 3 is associated with Caesar's Palace. You should sign up for the Total Rewards program to get slightly cheaper prices on their ridiculously overpriced food.. . The inside feels like I'm in Alice in Wonderland. It's very whimsical. Reading the menus posted on the outside was giving me a headache, with its hard to read fonts and lack of prices posted.. . The fare is very typical American/Italian fare - pizza, pasta, burgers, etc. Their signature seems to be the frozen hot chocolate. The frozen hot chocolate was large and tasty but it was a rather hefty $13 for one.. . The wagyu sliders were a bit dry. The creamy tomato soup was in fact rather chunky. It was good but definitely not worth the $9 or whatever it was that we paid. The penne ala vodka pasta looked decent but once again, super overpriced. The bacon lettuce tomato (BLT) actually had turkey in the sandwich, and it was a rather large sandwich.. . Service was fine.
I really think the only reason I come here is because it's situated in the middle of the strip and by the time I walk by, I feel very thirsty and the bright pink decor and ample outdoor seating draw me in. . . In all honesty I thought the frozen hot chocolate was good the first couple times I got it but this time it was just bad. So sweet that I couldn't even finish it and why the hell does it cost 11 dollars for some cocoa powder with blended ice?!? Also it took so long just to take our order. I waited over 5 mins just to even pay when there was no line....Everything is overpriced so reminder to self to not come back next time.
Not worth for money. Garden pizza was good but Alfredo pasta was disappointing. Service was biggest bummer. Our waiter was polite but he was too busy probably because they were understaffed. Even though 30% of restaurant looked empty we were asked to wait around 30 mins. And we had to wait for everything else, waiter, food, etc.
This place is definitely for you if you have a sweet tooth! I only came for dessert. I got the slice of cake and iced hot chocolate. Definitely in love with this place! I must go back!
Place look very cool and delicious however the blonde lady at the bar rude enough to ruin all good experience !
Right now i am in the restaurant sitting on the bar and i ordered hot chocolate. Everything is good except bartender . Her name is Rhonda. She is rude. She is literally yelling to us. I just feltso uncomfortable!
I had a frozen hot chocolate from the carry out window.  It tasted great, so rich I could only drink 1/2 of it.  It was almost $12 so I doubt I would have this again.
overrated, over priced, service was 2 stars but better than anything else here. I dont think I will be going back.
Based just on the frozen hot chocolate:. . The frozen hot chocolate is WAY too sweet to eat. I had 3 sips and couldn't have anymore. . The Oreo frozen hot chocolate is more tolerable, but still way too sweet. . Both frozen hot chocolates are pretty much overly-sweet frapachinos. . I didn't have any food here but from the looks of it, the food looks pretty good.
Terrible. Waited forever in line for a hot dog, which ended up being completely burnt.
Up front just know - you need to be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait - which is horrible BUT the food is good and the wait is worth it!. We went in here for appetizers - we got nachos and a pizza to share between three of us....and couldn't finish it all!! We were here for snacks and left so stuffed we didn't even have time to try the Frozen Hot Chocolate - boohoohoo!!. The nachos were cheesy and delicious, the pizza was good and crispy, and the portions are HUGE.. We also saw people order sandwiches, the hot dog, and cheesecake and all of them could have easily been shared by two people or more. . Considering what size a plate is when it comes out, the prices are totally justified as EVERYTHING is sharing-size.. You also get a discount when you use your Rewards card (Reward-member pricing is listed on the menu). . They have an outdoor patio / balcony that overlooks the strip, which could be totally fun to just hang out on, but since they didn't have the heaters on, we didn't sit out there.. Based on the food we had for appetizers, I would love to run into this place for breakfast one day, too!
I can get by the horrible greeter and slow service, as long as it gets me their delicious sundaes and frozen hot chocolates!!. . Pros:. -Desserts here are a MUST. -Deep Fried Oreo Sundae. -Frozen White Hot Chocolate. -Huge seating area. . Cons:. -Hamburgers start at $18 and range to $27, NO THANKS. -Wait time is longenough for you to lose your appetite. -Take-out window is rarely open. -Waitress was only sweet when giving us the check. -Only 2 waitresses with 20 tables. -Sharing charge of $6!!!. . When possible, go to the Take-out window, you won't be charged the $6 for sharing a sundae and there is a large seating area outside!
There are times when spending a little extra dough is worth it to satisfy your sweet tooth! Coming to Vegas frequently, I knew just the place!. . I love to come to serendipity to enjoy their food and then have it followed up by their frozen hot chocolate and a sundae! It was an especially good treat for a post Christmas vacation!. . However, this time around, my service was terrible! If we wanted to get something like another spoon, extra straw, more napkins, or hot water, it was rarely from our own waiter. We always got it from this kind busboy, which I don't even think it was his job to do that for us to begin with! When the bill came around, I asked if I could use my total rewards card to knock down the prices. The waiter, I believe his name was Jeffrey G, told me that he cannot give me the discounts. That doesn't make sense. Why would they advertise it if we couldn't do it? I then asked him why, and he hesitated for a long time, then said that he has asked us from the beginning if anyone had the total rewards card and that we said no. I CLEARLY do not remember him asking any such thing, nor did we respond "no" to totals reward. He proceeded to say that he can no longer change what is in the system, which being a waitress myself, I KNOW that it isn't completely true. Then he left the table, and when we were trying to flag him down, he would clearly look at us and then walk away, ignoring our table. He finally came back to the table when we were already standing up and walking out.. . We still tipped him decently, because of the busboy. But now that we think about it, we shouldn't have.. . All in all, the food was good and dessert too. However, the service ruined our night. Two stars for the food, ladies/ushers at the front desk, and the busboy! -3 stars for our waiter.
We were waiting for the Absinthe show and decided to use this restaurant to nibble on sth before going in for the show. We ordered Garden Pizza and added Pepperoni on top. I wasn't expecting a good pizza but it was simply awesome. I am not sure how the icecreams are but the pizza's are apparently good.
Loved the menu! Had the Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate for 2, so yummy! Our server was good.
Not worth the stop. Service is slow, and they are very understaffed. When a man in a suit and tie is bussing tables you know the restaurant has issues. Loud atmosphere. They stop serving breakfast at 11am. Waited 40 minutes for a table for to only to find out we could no longer get breakfast. No exceptions either.
i cant believe i paid 20 bucks for a hamburger with bacon and a fried egg on it... and it tasted plain. . wait time was long. . food is really overpriced u can better quality and flavor for what you pay for else where. . tried the frozen hot chocolate - it was 'meh' basically its like a frappacino with 90% whipped cream. . i would not eat here again
AMAZING!  Start to finish this place exceeded my expectations. Service was prompt and super friendly. Strong menu, and food is dynamite.  This is a must see, must eat.
Always wanted to try. Not impressed. Their signature drink frozen hot drinks were somewhat a little disappointing. Too sweet, tasted like a slushy melted ice cream. We had the chicken and waffles for breakfast... Ummmm no!!! Chicken too dry, potato too dry and waffles just lack that umpf! Pricing was a little over priced for the food that you ca
If you have a sweet tooth.  Then this is the place to come. But be prepared to wait for a table it is worth it.
Super excited to try the Serendipity 3 here because it's been a few years since I've had the original in NYC.  Then, got super disappointed.  I went for the take out and not the sit down restaurant.  I'm sure the sit down restaurant presents the frozen hot chocolates a little better than the basic plastic cups we got, but overall my experience was meh.  Definitely a try once kind of thing.  Can't beat the one in New York though.. . FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE:  This is what made Serendipity 3 so famous!  It definitely tasted more like a chocolate shake to me here than it did in NYC though. ):. . OREO FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE:  I have a limit with how much sweetness I can take, so a few sips of this for me is enough.  If you love oreos and sweets, then this is for you.  Pretty similar to an oreo milkshake.. . Ten dollar drinks here!  There are seats available right in front of the take-out window, but they are outside.  It's perfect when the weather is warm, but if it's cold...take it inside!
Tonight, my family and I had dessert at Serendipity 3. The portion size tends to be large and shareable. We ordered the following:. . 1. Mint Frrrozen Hot Chocolate topped with whipped cream and an Andes candy.. . 2. Cafe Serendip, which is an over flowing cup of coffee goodness, with an accent of nutmeg and cinnamon. . 3. Outrageous Banana Split - Cowards Portion, which consists of three scoops of vanilla ice cream and two bananas, topped with whipped cream, strawberry sauce, chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, and peanuts.. . 4. Colossal Brownie Sundae, which consists of two raspberry chocolate brownies, vanilla and chocolate ice cream and topped with hot fudge and caramel. . 5. Hot Chocolate, which was hot chocolate, whipped cream, and chocolate shavings.
I try to eat here whenever I come to Vegas so I can get my fix on the Frrozen Hot Chocolate. I enjoy the different flavors, especially the mint and the regular Frrozen Hot chocolate. That's the only thing I really love about this place. The food here is okay. I haven't tried the other desserts (although they look really good!), so I can't say much about them.
Great good great service I had a meat madness pizza as well as a Caesar salad  both were tasty And well prepared. I topped it off with the Oreo Frozen hot chocolate which was amazing and what they are known for will definitely go back
