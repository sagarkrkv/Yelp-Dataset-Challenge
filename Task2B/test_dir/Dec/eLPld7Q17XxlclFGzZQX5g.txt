All you can eat is the way to go!  I really love the spicy seafood mix and the nigiri here.   As for strategy, go for non-rice items first and then slowly move toward rolls.  Save your stomach for dessert especially the mochi.. . It's just so good here and the price is amazing for what you can get!  There are so many choices here that it boggles the mind.  I love choices!  The sushi here is great and you get more than what you pay for.  I didn't have any fishy taste when I ate it.  Definitely fresh and so delicious.. . The parking is ample and it is very close cramped seating.  Expect a wait during dinner time. The service was amazing!  It's one of my favorite sushi places in Vegas and I can't wait to return back!
Who knew there was such thing as good AYCE sushi, this place delivered. Kama was wonderful as we're all the rolls. The seafood salad is basically sashimi salad, so good! Wish we had a Yama sushi back home.
I love sushi  (but we don't get out as much these days) and when my hubby asked me what I wanted for my special birthday meal, this was my number one choice (we'd never been here but I'd seen this place on yelp and heard good things from many people). Hubby enjoyed it too, because he said he'd like to come here again! Our little one also liked his chicken and rice plate (the server suggested this when we learned that they didn't have fried rice, his favorite). . . Lots of choices on the two-sided menu- AYCE includes side dishes and appetizers, but not sashimi (no biggie) and the rules (order small, luckily, you can order half-rolls, which we did; no sharing unless everyone is AYCE) are listed on the front side of the menu. I tried the spicy tuna roll, 007 roll, and ordered several different shrimp rolls, but my favorite one was the Yama Crunch Roll. On the salad side, I loved the Seafood Salad- it was such a good portion of Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, and Octopus. I am definitely getting that again! We also had beef teriyaki (excellent), edamame, and gyoza (tasty, but I don't think hubby liked them because they weren't sticky, but a bit on the crunchy side). The Special Rolls are on the back side of the menu. Didn't reach that side, though, because we got full. I didn't want to overdo it. I was satisfied though, and we were also planning to have ice cream later on, too, elsewhere. . . Also got a nice presentation for my birthday- two sliced mochi ice cream (mango flavored) with a scoop of green tea ice cream in the middle accompanied with a birthday song and a lit candle. Aww, how sweet.. . It wasn't crowded, but one of the servers said that dinner is crazy busy. (Good to know!) Lunch is probably better because of that. ($20.95 for lunch AYCE). . . Decor is elegant and pretty; and also nicely decorated for the Christmas season. Hubby was surprised at how nice it was inside. It's not big, but it's not hole-in-the-wall, either. . . Service was excellent. And really appreciated the suggestions they gave on the sushi rolls. Everyone there is your server. Everyone's very nice, too. Empty plates were quickly taken away.. . The website needs a bit of an update. Prices could be listed on there, and the entire menu of sushi, would help out a little, too. Needs some attention. When you click on some items, a message appears on the screen, "this page is currently under construction."  . . Yes, we plan on coming back here for lunch.
Love love the #7 roll!! Apart from the 25mins wait during dinner peak, we truly enjoy the selections they have here.
This place is amazing.  Got to get the early or there will be always line out the door.  Sushi rolls are amazing.  Tuna is so fresh.  Awesome fast friendly service. Stumbled upon this place before heading to a concert. Definitely will be back
Holy cow, this place is always awesome! The best rolls in my opinion . -sun of a beach. -no name roll. -strip tease. -wet dreams. They're all amazing though and for appetizers I extremely suggest . -bbq ribs. -spicy seafood salad. -garlic tuna. -shrimp tempura . You barely ever have to wait to order more sushi when you're already seated, the wait to be seated is a little sucky but only on weekends! Totally worth the wait and the service is on top and super appreciated!
I'm a little confused as to why this place has such outstanding reviews. Did I miss something? My mother and I came here last night and the place was jumping. But I guess since it is by the college, Mondays would be busy. We ordered 2 rolls, miso soup, chicken teriyaki, and mix tempura. . . The miso was good. The rolls came out really fast, they were ok. Tempura was ok. It came with what looked like a tablespoon worth of dipping sauce. By the 3rd or 4th piece it was gone. And the reason why I docked a star, the teriyaki chicken. They give you a thin chicken breast which tasted frozen, slapped on some sauce and price it at $3.99. . . The total wasn't too bad under $30, but the food was so mediocre. Oh and not to mention the floor was a slip and slide!!!! I was worried my mom would fall down. I was wearing sneakers and felt like I was ice skating.
I died and went to Heaven.. Okay not literally of course.. But my stomach did. Blew up like a balloon because I wanted the AYCE.. . I was so impressive with the quality and the service. They servers were attentive and nice. I noticed because they would refill my water everytime it hit the bottom of the glass.. . The sushi quality was great!! I was so happy to finally eat something good in Vegas because for the past few days, I was disappointed. Glad I've tried this place and I would definitely be coming back again!. . I love the mochi ice cream. I had it twice, and my sushi was so mouth-watering. The rollers were extremely good as well. I love how you can half-order so you can try everything without overstuffing yourself. Damn my stomach hurt though cause I wanted to everything on that menu.. . You will be seeing me again, for sure!
LOVE their sushi!!!! There is no other place I eat sushi at. . . It is a "hole in the wall" type of place. Despite it being in an iffy area, people stand in cold & heat to wait to get in. This place is ALWAYS busy. Today, Friday, was no exception. They do not take reservations. . Our server took a while to get to us but a bus boy was quick to jolt down our orders & pass them on to our server. I think the fact that they are so busy takes away from the service but ask for anyone for anything & all are helpful, even if they are not your server. . . My recommendation: AYCE, come with an appetite.
It's a busy place.  However the services quick. Hamachi sashimi was very good. Also enjoyed the Hawaiian Roll, Miso soup (too salty), and seaweed salad.
I first heard about Yama on a plane back to Vegas a few years back from a man who raved about it! Thank goodness it lives up to its hype! The AYCE is such a sweet deal- but I recommend getting the half rolls so you can try the most sushi you can. Baby one more time and double dragon are my favorites! Whenever family or friends are in town, I always make way for them to try Yama. Great taste for such a great price!
It was a pretty good value. Overall it was better than average. The place was packed so the service was a bit slow. The sushi ran from good to excellent. There were no awful dishes or ones that "blew me away" either. I will go back and try a few more menu items and update my review afterward. Maybe I will add a star if the experience and food impresses me more next time.
Fake Japanese by Korean. They don't even serve Japanese green tea. Always run out of Uni during lunch hour. What a coincidence.. Weird rules to limit you from eating what you like to eat. They wrap everything with a lot of rice and force you to finish them before next dish. The wait in between well make you out of appetite directly. It's full of craps. Next one..
My to go place when it comes to raw fish.  Always #1 choice. Fish is super fresh, great menu selection, and if there's something special that you're craving you ask and they will try to fancy your taste buds.  We have been coming for the past 4 years and never disappointed unless it's one of their off days in the service.  That would be my only recommendation is for the service to stay consistent
So dirty, super greasy menu. Dirty plates. Food was bad. Bad interior. Very bad overall experience. I'm just being honest.
This place is great! All you can eat sushi is the way to go and make sure you sit at the sushi bar. The chef was very friendly and had our sushi made within minutes of ordering! So yummy youll def leave extremely full. . . AYCE pricing . Lunch: $20.95. Dinner: $23.95
