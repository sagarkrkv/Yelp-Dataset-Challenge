I've been here a few years ago for dinner and remembered how fatty and tasty their foie gras was. I also remembered how the waiter promoted their special of some white fish. It wasn't very flavorful or moist. . . Fast forward to last month, I came here for  chicken and waffles and foie gras pate for breakfast. Unfortunately they don't serve chicken and waffles during the weekday :( I walked away with yummy liver spread on toasted baguette. It was delicious. It was strange to come to a place like Bouchon and order only one item to share. I didn't want to waste stomach real estate on something that I wasn't craving. It's Vegas after all. . . The receipt had a spelling error, but it did give us a discount at the Bouchon bakery! :) I got a box of macarons for friends back home.
Looked forward to Sunday brunch at Bouchon.  Walked right in at 8:30am and got a decent table.  Spotted several celebrities and a table of what looked like some entertainment movers/shakers complete with the thick, Italian-designer glasses and man-purses.  We had an absolutely great server - full of trivia and knowledge about the place.  So, why the 3-stars?  Mainly the food.  The service and ambience just couldn't compensate for the food.. Terrine of foie gras - Should be terrine of highly salted pureed meat protein.  It was so salty that one couldn't detect let alone taste any foie gras.  We could have sent it back, but hey, it's Bouchon and we didn't want to get off on the wrong foot with the first item.. . Omelet filled with sauteed beef cheeks with a side of bacon - Both the omelet and bacon were overdone.  Expect a real French omelet to be light, delicate, and soft.  This omelet was thoroughly cooked ("eating underdone or raw eggs/meats may be hazardous to your health" be damned!)...reminded me of airplane food.  Hubby had the French toast - actually, more like a bread pudding French toast.  More like a dessert.. . The fresh French rolls with house-made jam were the best.  . Check this one off of our Vegas bucket list!
If you're staying at Venetian, it's hard to eat anywhere else for brunch. I mean... this place was literally on our way out of the room. They have a nice patio surrounded by fountains, and the omelets are different every day ;)
I love everything Bouchon.. . Amidst the bustle that is Las Vegas, you can escape into this haven.  It is nestled on the 10th floor at Venezia Tower.  The decor inside is amazing, as soon as you step inside you are transported to a French bistro. Tall windows let in plenty of natural light.  I melted into one of their booths sipping on a glass of Cremant de Alsace, completely grateful for the serenity of my surroundings.. . Was joined by 4 others to indulge in a leisurely dinner. . . The fresh baked Fugasse that is unceremoniously delivered directly onto the clean white table is beautifully formed and baked to crisp and airy perfection.  The vegetarian me, got lucky as their Pates du Jour was a mushroom based dish, it was earthy, rich and satiating.  . . Oh boy oh boy there are no words to describe what we were delivered for dessert.. The Berry Pavlova, this cloud of sweet indulgence was served with what I can only say are the most extraordinary strawberries I had ever tasted!!  They tasted like real strawberries, not the stuff we have got used to buying at the grocery store, but the small delicate ones that some of us have had the privilege of picking straight off the bush and biting into, to have an explosion of flavor fill our being.. I would go back just for that..  Also their Pommes Frites and Oeufs Mimosa are not to be missed.. . Bouchon delivers quality, service, attention and overall leaves you feeling blissfully satisfied.. . It is by no means cheap, but certainly you will get your money's worth.  Especially in contrast with all the overpriced and under par restaurants Vegas has a plenty.
Among the Thomas Keller Restaurants are the Bouchon Bistros in Yountville, Beverly Hills and Las Vegas. I'd been to Keller's French Laundry in Yountville years ago, but this was our first time in Bouchon Las Vegas, highly recommended by my business partner/editor Michael Perlis, and conveniently located in the Venetian where we planned to stay for my husband's recent November birthday. . . It started like this:. . Sommelier Eric, who also served as our very attentive waiter, opened a 2000 Lynch Bages at our table. We had brought in the wine, which was not on their wine list (wine 101ers note that it is not in good taste to bring in a wine that is available on a restaurant's wine list) and Eric offered to decant it. I told him I preferred to let it open in our glasses as once it's decanted there's no going back. (Not every wine needs decanting, which can age a wine significantly, so if I'm unsure swirling is safer. It took the wine 10 minutes to open up, and when we got to the last glass, I agreed with Eric, it could have been decanted.). . Now, back to our meal, as we decided to order oysters Eric suggested we go with a nice Champagne. I agreed, and it would give our Bordeaux more breathing room. After that Edordered the French onion soup. Then, compliments of the Chef de Cuisine Josh Crain, much to our delight we were served some incredibly mouth-watering appetizers:. . Assiette de Charcuterie - served with pickled vegetables, Dijon mustard & petite baguette.. . Pate de Campagne - country style pate with watercress, cornichons, radishes & Dijon mustard.. . Saucisson du Jour - house-made sausage.. . Dinner happened like this:. . Mama Bear had: Steak Frites - pan-seared prime flat iron, caramelized shallots and maitre d'hotel butter, served with French fries. (I had the sauteed Brussels sprouts instead, another of Eric's suggestions. I couldn't finish every scrap of my dinner...but I really wanted too!). . Papa Bear had: Steak Bouchon - grilled Snake River Farms' eye of the rib and sauce Bearnaise, served with French fries. (Ed dipped his fries into his Bearnaise too...we all did.). . Baby Bear had: Pates du Jour - fresh hand-made pasta that night was made with veal, Wagyu beef, leeks and fennel. (My daughter commented that she had never had pasta like this in her life. We agreed. It was incredible.). . Desserts to Put Us Over the Edge:. . Again with Chef Crain's compliments, our group of three was served these oh-so-delightful treats:. . Profiteroles - vanilla ice cream & chocolate sauce.. . Chocolate Mousse.. . Pear Tart and sorbet.. . Pumpkin parfait.. . The next day, as we were missing Bouchon, we had the ham and cheese croissants from the Bouchon Bakery!. . The Surprise Kitchen Tour:. . If you follow along this public photo album link from Facebook https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10204323641438583.1073741889.1455706632&type=1&l=a8bf3835d8 you can get a pretty good idea of the food, and the incredible tour.. . We started in the well-lit and sparkling clean kitchen where we met Chef Crain and dozens of kitchen staff preparing and plating the dinners. Also in the same kitchen was a monitor showing three kitchens all at once - live video of other Thomas Keller kitchens! If that wasn't enough, there was a case that held the daily menus for the other restaurants too.. . From there, we happily pretended to work off our dinner by strolling past chefs preparing leg of lamb, vegetables and dozens of pastries that would also be served up in their bakery.  . . We strolled more...passing giant mixers, meats, cheeses and more pastries...until we came to the end of our tour in one of three private dining rooms, for both intimate and large meeting groups.. . We had come full circle. We were back at the entrance of Bouchon, with nothing left to do but thank Eric and the management for getting us started on a gastronomic discovery we had no comparison for.  Bravo Bouchon.
The best foie gras ever. Amazing meal, worth the hype. Impeccable service!
High on pretension.  Service mediocre.  Limited breakfast menu.  Poached eggs were completely overlooked.  Presentation was minimal.  Very overpriced.
OK, I'm spoiled - I live within a 10 minute drive from the original Bouchon. So no, this is not as good as that one! . . I had brunch, by myself, at the bar. Had a nice cappuccino, followed by a glass of champagne. I had a sausage dish. When it came out, it was raw in the middle. They swiftly took it away and brought out a fresh "well cooked" dish. It was just "ok". I didn't finish it, and left with a meh feeling. Iwould go back to have dinner or lunch, though. . . Staff was efficient and friendly. Courtyard outside is nice for relaxing and enjoying your coffee and a pastry. People in Vegas tend to forget what the outside is like, unless they are poolside. So, the courtyard is a real treat.
Delicious French libations and food fare, everything was decent or better. The Bouchon Burger, pastries, and Croquet Madame were savory midday snacks. Definitely have the truffle fries, rockin'. If you are disappointed by any portion of your meal, they'll fix it. So service and food make this food experience worth the price.
OH my gosh the chicken and waffles. Seriously. I have had fried chicken and waffles before, but this roasted chicken was just so. much. better. And the waffle....savory and fluffy and amazing. The smoked salmon rillettes were amazing, as well. And on top of all the fantastic food, the service was impeccable. This will be a must for me every time I'm in Vegas!
On a trip to Vegas with friends I was tasked with finding a restaurant for dinner. I choose Thomas Keller's Bouchon.  We had a bit of difficulty locating the restaurant inside of the Venetian. Despite arriving on time for our reservation, we did end up waiting for a bit to be seated. . . The space is lovely. There is a narrow bar area with large mirrors and high tops tables separated partitioned from the main dining area. The service was excellent, the meal even more so. The food arrived beautifully presented. Our group had the steak, the chicken and a lamb that was a special entree. I had the steak with sauteed spinach instead of French fries. I am glad that I did as the garlicky spinach was great. The steak was buttery, cooked perfectly, cut easily for the pink center, and went well with the suggested wine. I tried my friend's chicken. The entire dish was good but the sauce was amazing. Bits of thick cut, rich bacon added to the flavor. Even the brussel sprouts were good. The portions were large but not overwhelming. We split their version of cheesecake for dessert. It came "farm chic" style in a small mason jar. The cheesecake was creamy and delicious, the perfect ending to a meal.. . I recommend the experience to others.
Bouchon is a great restaurant with exceptional staff.  As a Californian, I have to come here for my Foie Gras fix!
We make trips to Las Vegas often to play and to visit family and our trip never ends without going to Bouchon. The setting is very nice with a few seating options. Regular tables, high tops, the bar, and  outside tables that overlook the pool. If the weather is amenable, choose the outside raised patio seating, you'll be glad you did. The coffee is to die for and it never ends. They offer you some more to take with you. You drink it and ask for more. You drink that too. You get the picture- it's really good coffee. On our latest visit, we had a french toast for my special lady, the mad Russian, and I had the corned beef hash with eggs. We ordered a Bloody Mary - not because we needed them- but because they make them really well here.. The service is always top-notch and everyone is eager to help and is warm and friendly. When you happen to go to the Venetian, make sure you stop in and have a bite to eat and tell them that the patron saint of the martini sent you.
Went there for my wife's birthday celebration and enjoyed their wonderful brunch menu. Everything from start to finish was spot on. Our waiter Doug went out of his way to ensure our experience was amazing. His service and personable touches added to our enjoyment.  Nice atmosphere,  Excellent food, and Impeccable service. What more can I say? Thank you for a memorable time!
Sourdough waffles were delicious.  Chicken and bacon waffles were amazing.. . Great service at the bar. Espresso and mocha were spot on.
The best brunch on the strip!!!. . Since they don't take reservations for brunch but recommend coming in earlier to avoid longer wait, I along with my friends got there around 9:30 and were seated within a few mins.. . From the first moment you step on you can feel the cheerful/bright ambiance. Service, decor, and creativity all are bound to win your heart.. . The food is definitely authentic french and hence even the French toast aren't the traditional ones you get at the American brunch restaurants. Not to say it was anything short of delicious.. . Overall I had a great time and can't wait to get back for round 2 the next time I'm in that city.
This place exceeded my expectations. I came for a quick brunch not expecting much but I was blown away by the great atmosphere! I felt like I was in a cafe in Europe. The service was friendly and helpful. I have never had chicken and waffles before but after seeing it many times on the food network I decided to try it and I'm so happy I did! I'm not sure about chicken and waffles elsewhere but here they are great! I would return again just for that dish. The various coffees are made to order and any pastry you try from here is exquisite. I highly recommend for breakfast or brunch
The entrees were dissapointing. The soups, salads and other sides that I tried were good. I have been to Bouchon 3 or 4 times, I live in LV so we came for my birthday.. . Do not get the gnocchi, you will be so sadly disappointed. It ruined my night, I feel like I want to cry about it, but I was too shy to say anything and embarrass the guy I was with. They're not soft at all, extremely dry when I had them. They do not taste handmade. DO NOT ORDER the gnocchi, the only thing good about them was the goat cheese on top. I hope I can at least help someone else not make the same mistake I did.... . The lamb steak was delicious but very tough and not pleasant to chew, it came rare.. . The pistachio ice cream is very unique and very very good.. . Our waiter was great though :). . I gave the restaurant 4 instead of 3 stars because I don't like to make their ratings go down.
I had brunch here and found the food to be pretty average. I am not sure if I was supposed to order a specific breakfast item but I went with the daily special omelet which had filet. It tasted fine but wasn't anything to write home about. The omelet was actually quite bland and lacked seasoning. I also didn't enjoy the beignets as they were way too sweet and weren't moist enough.
Came back here longing for its beignets. Decided to have chicken and waffle also....food heaven! The best chicken ever. Cooked to perfection, tender, and perfectly seasoned. Everything else was also delectable. One of Vegas must visits.
Best restaurant in Vegas! I came here with my boyfriend for his birthday. We've heard great things about this place and the recommendations were on point. I order the seafood tower, the pate, salmon spread and the French onion soup. The seafood tower consisted of 1 lobster,  raw oysters from both coasts, raw clams,  mussles and shrimp. The oysters and clams were briny and perfect. The shrimp was half the size of the lobster tail. The pate came with roasted bread, radishes, spinach leaves and mustard. The salmon spread came with toasted baguette slices. It was thick like cream cheese but smooth when gliding on the baguettes. Talk about two savory spreads.They did not need any sauces for flavor. The Great service and ambiance. Will definitely come again!
Great brunch spot, game here to meet some friends while visiting town. Prices are reasonable and food is fantastic!!
Celebrity chef Thomas Keller brings his famous Napa restaurant to The Venetian Las Vegas.  The food was amazing.  We had the Croque Madame which I found out is a grilled ham & cheese sandwich on brioche with a fried egg & sauce Mornay, served with French fries.  We also had the oatmeal which they forgot to bring out with a spoon which is a miss for a place like Bouchon.  Took a while to flag someone down to get a spoon too.  Then we discovered it was missing the glazed pears.  The waitress sorted it out and kindly brought us another one even though we only expected to get some glazed pears on the side.  To make up for their mistake, they offered us a bottle of some special filtered water they have.. . Overall, good food in a nice French bistro environment.
I don't know if I'm reviewing the right restaurant because the Bouchon Bakery and Bouchon Restaurant are completely different entities. One thing that turned me off is that I called the number listed on this Yelp listing to make a reservation for Bouchon Restaurant. To my dismay, the person that answered the phone said I had dialed Bouchon Bakery and could not help me whatsoever. I kindly asked her if she could redirect meto Bouchon Restaurant but she immediately snapped at me and said she could not help at all. Being the passive aggressive person I am, I was shocked at how caddy she responded to me and told her to have a "nice rest of the day" even though I wanted her to experience the exact opposite. A bit of a bad experience to start off the night, but I ended up making a reservation just fine.. . Going into the actual review of the restaurant, I can say it was an average experience. Coming from a immigrant Taiwanese family, my parents and I aren't too accustomed with the palate of authentic French cuisine. Unfamiliar with the menu, my parents were initially confused with what to order, but the waiter was more than willing to help explain the nuances of each dish.. . My father ended up ordering the Leg of Lamb, my mother ended up ordering the Salmon and I ordered the Steak with Fries. Each of our dishes were accompanied with a French Onion soup.. . Our dishes came out fairly quickly, and my mom was ecstatic to try the French Onion soup (one of her favorite French dishes). Her first reaction was "Wow this is really salty." My father followed suit. Maybe it's the fact that both of my parents suffer some sort of Heart Disease or High Cholesterol that they are so sensitive to high sodium dishes. It got so bad for my mom that she had to add her glass of water to the soup to assuage the sodium. A bit embarrassing, but that's the length some people go.... . Each of our main entrees were fairly good. My father's Lamb was tender and full of flavor. My Steak was a bit on the salty side, but literally melted in my mouth and was cooked to the PERFECT medium rare. My mother's Salmon was so-so. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, my family loved the texture of the Salmon (along with the color). The only turn off was the saltiness of the capers. Considering that most French meals are supposed to be accompanied with wine, I totally understand the sodium level of their dishes. But WOW, I don't usually complain about salt, but those capers were extremely salty.. . Aside from all of that, Bouchon Restaurant was an enjoyable experience. The staff was super helpful and constantly refilled our water (a problem I constantly face with other restaurants). Although this restaurant may not fit my family's palate, the management of this establishment is superb. I would give them 4 stars, but the experience I had with the lady from Bouchon Bakery will always leave a stale taste in my mouth.
This is for Bouchon restaurant not the bakery:. Wonderful place for brunch and dinner. . Look at my pictures for reference!. . I have yet to try their chicken and waffles (must try next), but everything I have ordered, did not disappoint. Staff is very friendly and customer service deserves two thumbs up.. . Standard pricing for Vegas restaurants. . I recommend making a reservation through open table beforehand vs. showing up. I hear how people wait over an hour for a table and that is just no bueno!. . Romantic and intimate ambiance, plus for large groups, they have a private room which was really nice to dine in.
The wait wasn't too bad at all. Went here for brunch and the food was a lot and ok tasting :) I just came to get this off my restuarant list in Vegas . I would come back to try their dinner menu
I don't usually write reviews, but I had to say something about this place. We ate here Christmas Eve and, I must say, it was disappointing. We arrived for our 8 pm reservation and were told by the hostess there were "a few groups ahead of us," so there would be a wait...which was confusing, since the whole point of making a reservation was to avoid that. In any case, she recommended we have a seat at the bar and they would get us when they were ready. We then waited at an almost empty bar for over 20 minutes (not exaggerating) while the bartender walked back and forth in front of us without taking our drink order. We finally got our drinks right before the hostess came to get us for our table (almost 8:40)...so off to a very bad start, but we figured the food would be worth it.. Wrong. . We ordered the oysters (which were actually quite good) and the black truffle risotto, which was a special of the night. It was well cooked, but completely underwhelming. My date and I both agreed it was actually quite bland, as if the chef was content to let the truffles do all the work that seasoning usually would. . I had the braised leg of lamb, which was a squishy consistency I could barely cut with my steak knife. I honestly couldn't finish it. My date ordered the chicken, which by comparison to everything else, was the highlight of our food choices (if I had to eat here again, that's what I'd order). We topped off the evening with a clumsy apple crisp and the brownie bouchons, which were honestly not as good as some of the brownies I've made from a box mix. . Based on our experience, the ONLY good things about the restaurant were the ambience and our server, James, who, despite the fact our food was consistently coming out 5-10 minutes after the couple next us' (who came in after us), kept us engaged and entertained. . I won't go back and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I have tremendous respect for Chef Keller's accomplishments, so I can only surmise he's not really paying much attention to this restaurant, as it seemed more likely to be a Gordon Ramsey Hell's Kitchen project than a Michelin rated artist's endeavor.
Someone at Yelp should fix the business name - people write reviews for Bouchon on this entry, not for Bouchon Bakery.. . I have experienced both multiple times and I have no problem giving them both 5 stars, so it would work for me (lol) but still, I really think we need to spin off Bouchon Bakery from Bouchon to avoid further confusion.
Food was fine. Service was slow and terrible. Very disappointed because we had our best meal of our lives here a few years ago and brought out friends here because of it. I'm not sure we will ever be back. We should have known something was up once the waiter asked us if we had any time constraints. He completely ignored us. We were served bread before we even ordered. Our appetizers came before the cocktails we ordered well before them. The water filler found them waiting for us on the bar, they had been there a while. The waiter not once asked how our food was. We were there almost 3 hours. He never asked about drink refills, we had to track him down to order anything. We wanted dessert but were too tired and didn't want to wait another hour for him to take our order and then forget it in the window for a while. The waiter was odd, I asked him about the salads and he said something weird about not wanting to sell too many salads to our table so that he could sell us desserts instead. He upsold my husband for a truffle upgrade to his fries. They came without truffles, so he fixed the error, but he got them 3O minutes after the rest of his food, then still charged him full price. Very very disappointed to have had this service at such an upscale place. I expect much more if I'm going to spend that kind of money. The best service was from the water filler, who kept searching for our food and drinks that our waiter couldn't be bothered to worry about.
Made an effort to try a Thomas Keller restaurant and was not disappointed at all. Highly recommended!! We had the croque madame and its one of the best I've had. The monay sauce was not overwhelming, the rich melted cheese goes well with the ham and the brioche was perfectly made. Generous portions of well cooked fries! Will definitely come back!
(This is for the restaurant, not the bakery.). . Seriously one of the best breakfasts I have ever eaten. SO good!. . My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday morning. There was a wait so we decided to just sit in the bar area. We sat at a high top for at least 10 minutes and no one came to our table. So the bartender invited us to sit at the bar and offered to take care of us, which she did!. . We started with an order of the beignets. We wanted the special raspberry ones but they were sold out so we went for the standard spiced. They were good but not the best I've had, which was surprising. I expected them to be better. But the rest of the food made up for them!. . I had the French toast - which had a seasonal pumpkin flavor with fresh cranberries. This is definitely French-style French toast. It's more like bread pudding than bread so it's very dense. It was melt in your mouth delicious. . . My boyfriend had the croque madame which came with French fries. It was delicious as well. The bread was fresh, the egg cooked perfectly and the ham was flavorful. The fries were thin, crispy and yummy. We ate every bite of both breakfasts.. . So even though we had a little bit of a rough start, in the end we left very satisfied. I would highly recommend Bouchon!
Didn't live up to its Yelp rating. It's so hard to find. Casino direction was not clear. We went there for Brunch. We had the famous Croque Madame and French Toast. The Croque Madame was good, but not worth the price tag. French Toast was too moist and lack flavors. The wait was an hour, if it was not for the Roulette Table that kept me busy, I would not have waited.
This place was a gem, literally.. It's hidden in Venetian, guest room 10th floor.. Wait wasn't too long, but only walk ins are allowed for brunch so make sure you snack before going.. . I had the infamous croquet madame.. It was deliciously moist and the fries were awesome.. Not the best comparison, but everyone knows how Mcdonald fries are hard to resist... it tasted just like it, with the exception this was made from real potatoes.. . My bf got the corned hash, which was hearty and filling. Friend had lobster benedict, a special of the day.  She approved, which is hard to come by.  Her husband had the dish where you have a little of everything, eggs, pastry, drink, and breakfast meat... we wouldn't recommend it as it was just so plain compared to other fabulous dishes you can gorge on.  Sticky cinnamon pecan bun was nutty and the orange juice tasted freshly squeezed.. . Awesome brunch place! A must visit spot.
had family in town this weekend so I had to suffer the strip.  went to bouchon for brunch.  the place was packed and I was impressed with the precision of the staff.  I had CB Hash.  like everything at bouchon, it was perfectly respectable.  the CB was tender but lacked in tangy yumminess.  it also lacked in potatoes and crustiness. . . the one thing that was really off-putting on this trip was when we ordered a side of fries the server asked if we would care to make them truffle fries for a "small upcharge"?  my bad for not asking how small.  I think the fries were $5 and the upcharge was an additional $13.  when questioned, the server removed the charge without hesitation but the experience made me feel like a cheap-ass and left me with a bad overall experience of the place.  just put the price on the menu if you're that proud of your truffle fries.
Bouchon ... Smmooochon ... I had higher expectations for this place.  Went here for brunch with some friends while in Vegas.  . . I ordered the Croque Madame which was about average.  The egg was perfectly cooked with the yolk breaking the way I like.  Toasted Ham & Cheese with a side of fries ... I ate the whole thing but was left wanting more.  . . The beignets were okay since I compare everything to Cafe Du Monde.. . Just another overpriced restaurant in Vegas.
We always make sure we stop at Bouchon if we go to Las Vegas. Getting a reservation was easy using Open Table even on Christmas Eve.. . The house bread is delicious because it's always fresh and warm. For an appetizer, we usually get the Salmon Rillette. I saw it on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations and decided to try it. I don't regret it! If you love salmon, it's an amazing spread. My sisters love the foie gras here, but I can pass. I'm not a foie gras fan.. . Depending on the specials, my two go to dishes are the flat iron steak and the duck confit. If you love stuck, you can't go wrong with the flat iron and the price is reasonable. It's tender and very flavorful. As for the duck confit, I can actually order it as an entree. I usually stuff myself over appetizers that the duck is a good size for me. The preparation changes depending on the season. This time, I had it with fresh mustard and Brussels Sprouts. Nice and crunchy! Last time I had it, I had it on top of mashed potatoes and it came with some wine sauce. It's always good!. . All in all, great restaurant, very consistent. You can find it in the Venezia towers at the Venetian! Until next time Bouchon...
Ugh. The croque madame is overrated. But if I'm ordering bread with ham & cheese, slathered in fat with a side of fried fat, maybe I shouldn't be complaining. ^_^. . Service was meh; very slow. I don't think I'll be rushing to eat here again. I much prefer the bakery :3
