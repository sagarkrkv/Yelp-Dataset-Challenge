What an amazing place! The environment is absolutely lovely, although very crowded. I enjoyed the moving statues and the shops, but the best part were the slots in the casino. We did not play much, but when we played here, we won! I loved the Wild Red and Wild Blue Quick Hits. The staff was helpful and the cocktail server was efficient. On one of our three visits we did notsee a cocktail server for about 45 minutes, but when she made it on the floor she stopped by often. My favorite drink was the Pina Colada. It was very creamy and yummy. There are a lot of cash out stations and the restrooms where nearby. My only complaint (if I had to have one) was that the hotel/casino was so huge that it took a very long time to get from one end to the other for the Tram. Other than that, awesome experience. I plan to stay here on my next visit.
Review for the sportsbook specifically-. 6 months ago, this was the best sportsbook on The Strip. Now the TVs are blocked off by a terribly placed bar, and anything resembling comfortable seating is blocked off as Members Only (regardless of the fact that seating was only at half occupancy at most). It's insulting placing hundreds of dollars in bets and being given a shitty conference room chair to sit in. If you want to see a good sportsbook gone terribly wrong, head to Caesars.
One of the best places on the strip. Like coming here even when I don't stay here.
The best part about this resort is the location.  It is right in the center of all the action.  Bellagio and Paris to one side and the Mirage and Venetian on the other with the new High Roller obsevation wheel right across the street.  Perfect if you want to be able to walk to all the action.  The staff is friendly, there are great restaurants and the gaming is great.  It would have gotten 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that our room was beat up abit.  There were big scratches on the TV console, a big burn mark on the sofa where someone had set down a hot iron and there were about 30 of those plastic things that that are attached to a shirt that holds a price tag on our carpet.  I know it was not vaccumed when we arrived.  The only reason we didn't move rooms was because we had a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountains.  The rooms are large and well equiped with TV and whirlpool in the bathroom and steam showers.  Mini bar didn't work either, it was hot and when we arrived there was a bottled water missing and of course they charged us for it, even though it was never replaced from the previous people.  I guess it's our fault for not notifying the front desk upon arrival.
The place has upgraded over the years...prices of their rooms have gone up extremely but there are tons of eating places to go to here as well as shopping. I usually wait for deals to stay here. It's in the center of the Vegas strip and walking distance to all other hotels and restaurants is a plus. It's upscale and classy. I love the forum shops as they have some of my favorite stores. Bathrooms are kept clean, the slot machines are my thing but my hubby goes for poker tables. He says they all start high usually. There is always entertainment outside especially by the bar and entrances. Everyone should come here...
When you come to Vegas, there are certain Hotel/ Casinos you think of.  Caesars Palace is still the grandaddy of the Strip, and while its a bit old, it still draws the crowds.. . They've built newer towers, but the best location to stay is the Augustus tower, located right by the lobby.  The other towers are located miles away, and frankly its just too far.. . They have everything you can ask for.. .the casino, shows, restaurants with celebrity chefs (ie: Flay, Ramsay), and a huge shopping area which has high end stores like LV to affordable stores like Victoria Secret.  . . Its still one of my favorite Vegas locations, and its even better when I get comp'd.
I will make this short, but sweet. I love this place. If I am not here, I am in lake Tahoe. But this is VEGAS and it is hard to compare them both. This trip was comped, and I was visiting for a wedding. I was astonished when I walked into the Augustus Tower Senator Suite. It makes me wish I could live there. The casino was loose, the drinks were flowing, and the Vegas feeling of luck was in the air. No big wins on the gambling, but a lot of good memories and delicious meals. See you soon, All Hail Caesar!
While this may not be my favorite hotel in Las Vegas, the classic and old stand by, Caesars Palace is almost as good as it gets. I have stayed in all of the towers and there are definitely some towers better than others. The rankings go:. . 1) Augustus... one of the newer towers the best part about the Augustus tower is the location.  Above the Qua Spa and Gym and near the front of the hotel the location and quality of rooms makes this tower my faovrite.. . 2) Octavius... little far from the majority of the property but nicest rooms are found here.. . 3) Nobu... cool new hip and clean.  Center of Casino is nice too.. . 4) Palace... by the pool, large rooms.. . 5) Forum... nothing too special. . 1864) Roman... do not book a room here unless u want the cheapest thing possible. Very outdated and not as clean as rest of rooms.. . The restaurant selections are great at Caesars and the center of the strip location is wonderful.  . . Can get expensive but there are not many better classic places to stay at on the strip.
Definitely the BEST hotel that I've ever stayed at. You have to play BIG to get the benefits but I didn't mind. Bachannal is just down stairs and trust me, you have to experience at least once in your life. The MACRONS are AMAZING!! There are two different towers for each room. Augusta & NOBU. I Like the privacy at NOBU and the luxury decor in the room. This is my 5 STAR pick if you're going to stay in Vegas. Plus being a 7 star diamond card doesn't hurt either
huge hotel and casino
Not sure what happened over the years, but we just had a very poor customer service experience with a late check-in of guests from Europe.   Thought everything was set-up and double-checked to avoid any complications (I booked through Travelzoo) and at 9 p.m. at night, I get a call from our family standing there unable to check in to their room after a day of flying to get there.   Working with Josh at the front desk, and John (the manager) was not as customer-friendly as I had hoped.    When I explained how I booked the room through a promo with Travelzoo, Josh asked me who Travelzoo was....  oh boy, I knew we were in for a long phone call.   It was one of the most stressful experiences I have had in a very long time - for something as stupid as booking a hotel room of all things (really people??), as I was home in California and not there in person with our guests to rectify the situation.  After calls to Travelzoo, Caesars concierge (Meredith is a shining star there!), and holding on two phones with the hotel check-in staff, 30+ minutes later, the problem was resolved.  We even wanted to bypass Travelzoo and pay with our credit card to get our family checked-in, and they needed an authorization faxed back to them...   no fax at home, we were in bed when we get this call and it was an unbelievably bad experience.    But it had to escalate to being uncomfortable and unpleasant - and that as awful.   I don't think I would recommend Travelzoo or Caesars for a Las Vegas trip to anyone.   It should not be this troublesome to have planned and paid for a room since October and then be treated like this.  I even called the hotel a few days in advance to make sure there would be no hiccups - thought they had it all figured out, but no.    We had been to Caesars in years past, and think we won't be going back - there are too many other lodging options for people in Las Vegas.  Two words - Customer Service.   Treat your guests the way your would want to be treated while on vacation, and spending a good amount of money on two rooms for a three-night stay at your hotel.
What's not to like about Caesar's?  Great restaurants, beautiful hotel and casino, shopping, concert venue, obnoxious talking statue show & giant fishtank!  Fun for all ages!  :D
This review is for the Laurel Collection part of Caesars, only. . . You come to Vegas expecting great service, right? . . The moment we arrived at the check in we were greeted by a dismissive woman named BLAIR who immediately shirked us off before we even got to the counter telling us just to wait in line. Her tone made me feel like I was at a Holiday Inn somewhere in the sticks. I thought: is she having a bad day and rude to everyone? But when I saw that wasn't the case i figured maybe it's because she assumed we were non English speaking Asian tourists and thought she could treat us like second class citizens. . . But we still waited patiently while she continued to ignore us. . . After a while we asked when she could help us and she just said "it will be a while". "How long?  We've been waiting for a while" "i don't know, a while.  I was busy when you came up to me so a while".  Her rudeness and attitude was shocking beyond being totally inappropriate. . .  90% of your job is to accommodate guests and make them feel welcome and all you can muster is a lousy attitude that makes guests feel like a nuisance?. . When we called her out for her disrespectful tone she started arguing back at us giving us more attitude! I can't think of any other time I've come to Vegas and been treated so poorly. I suggest she leaves the service industry if she dislikes helping people so much.
was there last weekend.... got free two nights to spend at Caeser Palace.... I did not expect too much before I arrived.... and it came out that it exceed my expectation.... me and my friends love almost everything in this hotel and we spent great two nights there.... i would definitely go back in the future.... special thank to Claire Yang...:)thank you so much for arranging a super nice view for my stay...
WARNING!!! ATTENTION FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS!!! SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! CHOSE DIFFERENT HOTEL!!!. If someone has extension of the passport, please stay at any other hotel but this. My entire family was treated by staff very rude. I was told that US laws are not applicable in this hotel. And even if you have valid extended passport with valid US visa you are not allowed to play or be near gambling area. It was such a disappointment after paying thousands of dollars for the flight and hotel ( where at the check in they accepted same passport with no problem). . When we tried to resolve this Security employee treated us the way that no one deserves to be treated. Throwing our document... I have never had this kind of attitude in my life anywhere in The world.. If there is a way to submit negative review- this is for this hotel.
I recently stayed here for 3 nights with a few friends and we had a blast! The room was newly renovated and beautiful. The bathroom was amazing, glass door shower, spa bath tub and double sink. The only issue we had with the bathroom was the toilet. .... it ran all day and night. We called to get it fixed and no one ever came to fix it. The whole hotel/ casino is gorgeous,  we walked around looking at everything and got lost a few times because it's so huge. The forum shopping area is beyond beautiful and has an amazing fish tank filled with lots of cool fish. The staff was pleasant and helpful, always right there when we needed something.  I would definatly recommend this hotel to anyone!
Went to Caesars to celebrate my husband's birthday and I thought CP would be a great place to spend that vacation and a great way to bring in the party.  I loved it!!! We stayed in the Augustus towers and we were super glad we did.  We loved the closeness of the Augustus towers first of all as it was very easy to to drop in and out without having to walk all over the place.  While the other towers were nearby, Augustus was the way to go.  The location on the strip is great and we were certainly excited we chose this place.  It also helps that those nights are included for SPG members as well.  We arrived and were checked in very quickly.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating to us and we got a great vibe from them.  Our room was ready and we had a high floor - that was a great upgrade.  The rooms in the Augustus were really big and I was happy that my money went to a great sized room.  We had so much space for my stuff.  The resort itself is well taken care of and since our family were also staying at Caesars this made it perfect.  The amenities were excellent and the housekeeping did an amazing job at taking our requests for when it came to cleaning the rooms.  Seeing as we were in the desert I was really wishing I had brought a humidifier because the air is SO DRY there.  I didn't experience that at one of the other hotels I stayed at last year.. . My husband and I were able to go to the Bacchanal buffet and enjoyed our breakfast and brunch there along with trying some of the other restaurants such as Rao's and Spago (Spago was terrible by the way, but it's not officially part of "Caesars", and Mesa"  Everything was clean and flawless and really want to come back and stay at Caesars again due to our amazing experience when we were there.  Thanks to CP for making my husband's birthday celebrations memorable.
Just came here for Spago by Wolfgang Puck and for Shania. Both were wonderful. Staff was very helpful and the casino was rather spacious and huge. I saw a lot of bros and douchebags... not sure what else to say about that.
Love this hotel! Rooms are gorgeous, bathroom is monstrous with a whirlpool tub and a tv in the bathroom (what?). Pretty easy to navigate once you do a couple laps. . . The only downside, is the mini bar is pressure sensitive, so if you accidentally touch one of the items in the fridge or on top, you bought it, even if you don't consume it. Also, there's a coffee pot in the room, but you have to pay for the coffee so bring k cups with you. . . Other than that, love it!
Just checked into my favorite hotel in Las Vegas. I have been to all the nice ones and love the beds here and the rooms. .   Yet, on this Christmas Eve I'm so disappointed and frustrated . Long , long lines to check in. Which are taking forever.... That's to be expected so we wait. When we are waiting forever and people are cutting the lines and getting service before everyone else, I begin to get frustrated . And are others in the line. A gentleman behind me and I point this out to the clerk and she goes to the manage who just shrugs her shoulders at us. BAD MANAGEMENT style!!!.  Okay, it's busy so let it go. (Sing stupid song to self).   We finally get to the counter and meet the most friendly guy! He is going to make everything awesome. We paid reservations from Caesars site and not any discount broker. He said he was so happy to upgrade our room ! Upgrade , nice surprise gift for wife! Nice! .   So.... We end up in the forum tower. 6415. Old old room. Old carpet . Old bathroom. Fuzzy tv with horrible reception. View ....terrible. Furniture from  Austin powers movie. Velvet purple!!! Yuck!.   So no more Caesar for my fave. I could have stayed at so many hotels and had a better room and no lying staff. .   Oh and my gift as the wife? A coupon book with a free drink!
This place sucks there is a reason they are going bankrupt. I checked in on Dec 23 with the OPTION of an upgrade ,checking in the bitch never told me she was just putting me in the most expensive upgrade staying in the Octavious tower 6 miles from the casino she just put me in there. The whole Ceasers Entertainment organization sucks. I didn't care about getting charged for the shitty room just tell me when there is a charge, don't assume but that's this shitholes way of business. I recommend staying anywhere else or just wait until this dump organization us owned by someone else and hopefully a more classy group. Plus the casino is tighter then hell , can't win shit here I am very disappointed in this dump and I lived here for 10 years there are so many better local places to go to. This place is nothing more then a tourist trap for foreigners who are blinded by the big lights and glitter real Las Vegas people know better then to come here.
The hotel management suck! I called them to let them know traffic in their parking backed up to six level, after talking to hotel manager and security managers I was told they don't have anyone to manage and direct traffic , this only happens in Cesar palace, all other hotels have security to manage traffic. Never ever come back
I am a big fan of Caesars Palace! It's so royal and beautifully decorated. It has great restaurants and shops located inside this massive establishment. The casino itself features a lot of the same slot machines and tables seen in the other casinos. It is centrally located on the strip and easy to access.
I wished there was minus star I could give to this hotel. By far the worst hotel I have ever been. From terrible hotel registration to delays about getting our luggage to all the complains of all other people in line, and not to mention the bugs found in our bed sheet.. It could not be any worse . Just can not wait to finish our stay here. The manager by the name of Jon Bernard at the front registration is absolutely ignorant to the customer issues and needs and he even made fun of my daughter's insulin medication that was left in her luggage as it was delayed in being delivered to our room. Old Ceasars was hundred times better than this new refurbishedhotel.. Do yourself a favor and stay either at Wynn, Venetian  or Mandalay bay ....
Definitely showing it's age.. Was attending a convention, and upgraded to the Octavius Wing.  Liked the coffee in the morning down at the separate check-in area.. But the tile in bathroom is getting grimey, shower fixture was rickety, bed sagged.. I hope my convention is in a different hotel next year.
Our room was in the Palace tower, but the way the hotel management handled our issues, I would never go back to any tower in caesars palace.. We didn't have high expectations and still got disappointed. We fully paid for a package and when we checked in the guy at the front desk suggested to upgrade to a better room. We asked for the price and he said he cannot tell us because we booked through a third party. It was obviously a lie so I said that we have to get the numbers before deciding. A magic happened and in 3 seconds he had the numbers, which were additional $800 (!!!) for our 6 nights stay, for a room that doesn't sound better.. Then, we went up to the room and were surprised to see that:. - the carpet was dirty (dried cranberries), and very OLD,. - the faucets were full of corrosion,. - one faucet was not working,. - you have to flush the toilet twice because the first time does nothing,. - very low light in the bathroom,. - overall, the entire room was very old, felt like going back in time to the 90's.. We called front desk and they sent someone to fix the broken faucet, but that's about it. So we asked for a room transfer, and we asked to see the room first, they took us tosee a room that was SMALLER (!!!) than our room, which was a waste of over 1 hour of wait time. We specifically paid for the slightly larger room because we were 4 in the room (3 adults). Then, they showed us a room which was the same size but had roughly the same issues as in our rooms, probably because the room was in the same tower (palace). We had to go all the way to the reception to get the key to the other room because they didn't want to send someone to give us the key (!!!). Even worse, initially they said we cannot see the room, we have to move without seeing it. Obviously I insisted on seeing it first.. Then, we realized we will be billed for resort fee, which is common on the strip (as they said), even though our package said we fully paid for everything. We thought we don't have wifi so when they said the resort fee includes wifi we were at least happy about that. BUT, we only had one bar when we used the wifi!!! just in case it's not clear -- wifi with 1 bar feels like dial up, which completed our experience of a hotel in the 90's :(. So, we asked to talk to a manager after they suggested to take down the resort fee for a couple of days, which is a joke. The manager called us only at the next day at 10pm! and only to the room, even though we asked them to call our cell. And then we gave them our cell phone number again and they did the same thing after 2 more nights! so we only got to talk to a manger just before our last night there, after spending hours on the phone with probably almost 10 different representatives, explaining our issues over and over again.. Eventually the 2nd manager removed the resort fee completely, but it was not enough, I will never go back there.. Just to be clear, if we had paid $60 a night as in the Excalibur then we would accept the poor maintenance of the room and also the service, but we paid much more for Caesars (hard to say exactly because it was a package with the flights) and we did not expect to feel like we're in the 90's.. Other than the room, the casino stinks from smoking, slightly more than the average on the strip, and extremely more than new hotels such as Aria and Cosmopolitan.. The only reason we gave Caesars 'poor' instead of 'terrible' is the location, and also some restaurants were ok.
We stayed at the Augustus tower in Caesar's Palace. The room was complementary so this review is based exclusively on the room and does not factor in the cost that would usually be incurred. The Augustus tower is located on the left side of the lobby - a plus - since you don't need to hall your luggage across the casino to get to the elevators. The room was spacious, must have been 400 square feet, with a shower and a jacuzzi and separate latrine. Caesar's is an older property in some places you can see its age, the shower was leaking into the bathroom floor. In addition, the latrine was not ventilated, so depending on what and how much you ate the day before, it can be an interesting experience. The good thing is that there is a phone in the latrine, so in case you need to make reservations, call the airline, check on credit card bills etc, you can take care of it while in the act. 4 stars. Highly recommended for any Total Rewards member.
Depending on which tower you booked, front desk will try to upgrade you as they did me and I took the bait.  I had booked two rooms  and upgraded each for $30 a night.  Not sure if it was worth it but jacuzzi tub was really nice.  The heating system wasn't working in our room and maintenance was on top of it.  The flat screens are small.  Checking in and out was easier then other hotels.  Staffall seemed nice.  Casino is smokey.  Shopping is incredible since the forum shops are there.  The $28 resort fee is bullshit but what can you do, all hotels charge this fee now.  Property is huge but close to Bellagio and the Linq.  Need to get better acts then that depressing bitch Celine Dion and Seinfeld.  All in all its a better hotel to stay at it just doesn't exude sexy like the Cosmo.
The resort fee of $25 per DAY is total BS. Wifi and gym are not included in your hotel fee... Was disappointed about that... Why try and screw the hotel guests for money on these basic amenities? I think it's a bad approach. Also didn't know about the automatic sensors in the fridge and was charged $240 for moving some drinks out of the fridge to make space for some birthday cake. Got the money back but was rudely informed that the fridge wasn't for personal use. (Ummmm sorry but if Im gonna pay $200+ a night for your hotel room, I'll use your fridge for whatever the f@ck I want to) Overall, I think Caesars is desperate for money (they're in huge debt) and is taking the wrong approach on trying to screw guests for small things. I'd be more inclined to spend my money there if they weren't being so tight and obviously desperate. Will be staying somewhere else next time I go to Vegas.
I decided to get an extra room key for my daughter who had just lost her room key. It's 11:55 pm and I had to stay in a line of approximately 35 people to ask for an extra key. They called this a 5 star hotel and this is the 5 star service You should be expecting receive when you stay here.
i am waiting for check in more than 1 hour, and they can't find our name on the booking list, and the attitude was awful. And they delivery our luggages like 2 hours!!!!! I even can't take a shower cause them didn't have robe in the room and bin as well....
Stayed at Caesars Palace last week for the first time after staying at many other hotels in Las Vegas over the years. It is an icon and we were curious as to how it would compare to other upscale hotels in Sin City....... we had a blast ! Great place to explore..... walk downstairs to Forum Shops , bars,many fun restaurants ..... convenient self parking...... very spacious rooms ... its an oldie but a goodie ..... highly recommend Caesars........ only slight hiccup was the check-in which was fairly crowded while we were there.... while the line moved well and it only took about 15 minutes in line.... it seemed to be something that could be easily improved by adding maybe 2 addt'l check-in people. Caesars was a fun and pleasant place.
They will mess up your reservation. I made two room reservations three months ago for a family vacation.  When I made the reservations I made one request:  I need the rooms on the same floor next to each other.  They said they will do it.  However when I checked in today, I found that they totally ignored my request.  I checked in as possible but they said they don't have rooms anymore.  They put us on different floor.  Now my wife and kids are going to be on different floor. What kind of idiots ignores one effing request.  Now my family needs to split up and stay on different floors. Way to f up someone's vacation. You f morons.
Made our stay in Vegas memorable.  Cesar's has always been my all time favorite hotel! Upgraded room at check in! Rooms are immaculate. Comfy beds luxurious bathrooms and room service was quick and tasty (may I say a little pricy but definitely worth it since we were still recovering from the night before). I know where I'm staying again for my next Vegas trip!!!
Roman tower room 1362: This room is dated, tiles in the bathroom seriously needed to be regrouted. The view to the pool was good and made up for little imperfections here and there. Tv remote is not OEM and does not offer all functions to the tv.. . Casino: Games r very diverse from slots to table games. . Restaurants: very good choices. From chinese noodles to high end steak house, u get a great variety of some of the hottest restaurants around. . Shopping: fabulous, the forum shops have luxury stores for men and women. Big plus is Tourneau, they have many luxury brands under one roof.
The WORST!!! Buyer beware! Paid $130 to stay 19 hours 4pm check in, 11am check out. Trashy! dirty! RUDE GUST SERVICES! Mold in bathrooms.
