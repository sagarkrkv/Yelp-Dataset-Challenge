I read here a lot of good reviews, then I went there to check. First time I saw a long line and I was pretty hungry, then I gave up and ate chinese food near there. Today we went and still a long line, but we took. Believe me: worth every minute we spent waiting!!! Its so delicious!. I had some fresh oysters, red wine and Alaskan Chowder! He had the Pan Roaster.OMG! We'll be back tomorrow for sure!!! We loved it!!!! I recommend that for sure! So good food!   Now, I understand why always a long line! =-)
The best oyster bar in Vegas. I've eaten here a handful of times and have never been disappointed. I always get the combination pan roast and it is delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. If you're not familiar with a pan roast, its kind of like a seafood stew in a buttery tomato sauce. I had never heard of a pan roast until I tried it here, and let me just say I was hooked from the first bite!. . The only downfall is that this place is tiny, the bar seats 18 only, and that means there are super long waits! On my last visit, we waited about 45 minutes for a party of 2 which isn't so bad, but sucks if you're hungry ;)   Let me just say that the wait is worth it. I would wait hours just to eat here, it is that good. Do yourself a favor and try this place! 5 stars for sure!
The food is worth the wait, we would literally wait an hour plus just to get a seat. I take every visitor from out of town here and this is a spot where we go to drink and eat their rocker fellers which they don't have anymore. The chefs and waitresses are always funny even when they are super slammed. It's entertaining and walking through the casino - even the dealers smile and say hi. I just love this place, always great energy and  always win when I gamble there haha. Enjoy all the good eats!
FYI, get the pan roast at less mild to medium spice. I tried it very mild due to sharing it with a friend that doesn't care for spicy. But wow, the flavor was totally different. I'm definitely not going to knock down a star for that. I wish the lines weren't so long! I've stopped by 3-4 times now, and each time the wait looks to be 45+ minutes, so i had to pass :(. . But i can't wait to eat it again!
I have came here multiple times and have waited all different lengths of line, however this trip was 2 hours waitline and it was still worth the wait. Restaurants in LA still cannot replicate the pan roast that I always want it when I visit vegas. This place is must-try. The combo pan roast always melts in my mouth. The portions are huge so there's always leftovers. don't share unless the person you're sharing with, is also gonna order another different type of pan roast and you get to try it and eat it for later. If they are not, like I mentioned, don't share, you'll want your own to eat later back at the hotel, when you come back from that club, bloated from alcohol, but room for pan roast. Plus you waited that dang 2 hours, so just get your own.
My review is not based solely from the food but the whole experience of the restaurant, starting from the wait. This restaurant, although I don't know if a place this small should even be called a restaurant, has a LONG WAIT. By long I mean a few hours maybe. Do not be deceived by the seemingly short line. Since there are only a handful seats, it takes forever for your turn to come around. . While waiting, you are going to suffer from the smoke and dirty carpets. I felt almost itchy and disgusted waiting in line since the restaurant is placed right in the middle of a casino floor. There isn't even a proper door or sectional to divide the restaurant from the casino. I started having headache from breathing in the pungent air for such a long time. . As for the food, yes they are good because there is a ton of seafood in there. But I didn't feel like it was special to the extent that you would wait hours for this in such a terrible environment. The portions are huge, so definitely share it with someone. There is no way you could even finish half of the food by yourself. . The service of the restaurant is pretty bad. There is a "chef" who cooks and there is a server/chef who does everything from cleaning the tables, cooking the food at times, serving the drinks and food, bringing you the check. So evidently, this person is super busy. You have to wait for him to come close to you to ask for more drink or even your check. Also, while we were eating the chef got frustrated and said things to the "server". This just made everything super uncomfortable for me because it is a complete open kitchen. . . Vegas has so many great restaurants. DO NOT COME HERE AFTER LOOKING AT THE REVIEWS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME DURING YOUR TRIP. . Maybe, if you have a ton of time and want to have a lot of seafood for the cheap price and live in Vegas or something, then I guess this restaurant could be good for you. . . I WOULD NEVER RETURN HERE EVER AGAIN. . DISGUSTING AIR CONDITIONS.
This is by far, the best oyster and creole creation in the west coast. The long lines are so worth it, except you have to drool while u watch people eat the most scrumptious meal like it was shipped from the french quarter.
The line is worth it for the food. I'd give it 5 stars but the looooooooong line killed it.
Pros:. . Fresh seafood, cooked well. Huge oysters on the half shell. Friendly service. Great atmosphere, it truly is a "bar" with 18 seats.. . . Cons:. Be prepared to wait well over an hour to be seated.. They have six kettles to cook the food, so you may end up waiting awhile for your entrees. After waiting 2 hours to be seated, we then waited an hour between our oyster appetizer and our main courses.
We heard about this place while in Sin City and decided to check it out.  We heard that the lines can be really long so we decided to go in the late morning.  It was the perfect time to go as there was no wait.  We were immediately seated and our order was taken.  We shared a Pan Roast and bowl of clam chowder.  The food was excellent.  It was also cool to see it being cooked right in front of you.  Service was excellent and prices were decent.  This is definitely a place to checkout!!!
Glad I found yelp to tell others this is the best place for oysters, clams and more! There is typically a LONG line as that's the bad...the good is  its worth the wait! Don't be discouraged! They are also to convienant to my house as my husband always knows where I want to go for dinner...anywhere near this place, just go...we love this place!
Pan roast was delicious,  crab salad is to die for,  I've also tried their clam chowder, absolutely delicious... my goodness in can eat there every day- I want to thank everyone there including the chef's, always smiling and I've always had great service and the oyster bar at Texas station is delicious and just as friendly
Had the combo pan roast. Not as good as ritters steam kettle. I think ritters is a lil bit more creamy and oyster bar is a lil more saucy(?) They only have 12 seats... literally a bar so you must wait in line for awhile depending on when you go. Was there awhile round maybe 11 ish 12 ish on friday night. Wait was about 40 minutes. Order spicy level #8 and it was pretty spicy considering I'm korean but then again I can't handle too much spicy. . . The chef had an unappetizing facial impression/expression. He does not look happy to be working there. If they're going to have the chef out in the open I think it's a good idea to have someone who seems more genuinely happy to be making the food the customers are going to eat. But the older man who takes care of the cleaning, hosting, taking orders, etc.. was very friendly and has nice impression.
Wow. This soup is AMAZING. Ordered the pan roast combo and boullibase and half dozen of the clams..  WOW. The pan roast is creamy, flavored right, and the seafood was so fresh and tasty. I'm hungry again thinking about it. The only thing that sucks about this place is the wait. There are only 18 seats at the bar but it is definitely worth the wait!  The oysters are fresh!  Please please please get the pan roast combo.
I wish I could give 6 stars.. . I've heard all the hype about Oyster Bar from my friends and family. I told them that they shouldn't put it on such a pedestal because once I get it, it won't be as good as they say. Let me just say that they didn't hype it up enough. Oyster Bar is for real. The hype is real. You HAVE to go when you're in Vegas.. . Pan Roast. I have never had such a bomb tasting Pan Roast. On top of thay, I've never had such a BIG Pan Roast. I couldn't even finish it. I forced as much as I could just on pure awesomeness of taste.. . Clam Chowder. Wow wow wow. I should have just gotten a cup instead of a bowl because I couldn't even finish the Pan Roast. Don't forget to add the crackers. Recommended but not required. So good.. . Oyster Bar will be on my list each and every time I come to Vegas. 6 stars.
Oyster bar is always our go to spot that we absolutely must visit each time my husband and I go to Las Vegas! Oyster bar is located in the palace station (be sure not to get it mixed up with another placed called oyster bar is LV.. It's not the same). . The best time to go is 3am-8am.. We arrived in LV at 6:30am & got to oyster bar at 7:30 on a Sunday morning & for the first time ever... When we got to the bar we were the only customers. The chefs mentioned that there was a rush about 30min-1hr before we got there. Usually when we go to oyster bar we have to wait for an hour or more (but once we get our food, the wait is definitely worth it!) . .  We always know what we want to order before we even get to oyster bar. Our usual is combination pan roast w/ level 5 spiciness w/ two rice. The combo pan roast includes shrimp, crab, & lobster.. Some times we like to pay extra & add clams. Level 5 spicy is not very spicy.. I don't like too spicy but my husband does, so sometimes he ask the chef to prepare him a spicy sauce on the side. If you aren't too hungry I would suggest sharing, but if you're very hungry... Get your own because it's soooo good! We also order the oysters (if u go during happy hour they're cheaper) . . The staff are all very friendly, usually it's the same chefs that are working each time we go. Overall, I definitely recommend going to oyster bar, once you try it once you'll be hooked! Try to avoid going during busy hours such as lunch & dinner time to avoid the long wait.  . . I rated them 4 stars because of the long wait.. There's only about 12 seats at the bar or so (you have to be 21yrs old or older) but I rate their food (combo pan roast esp) 5+ stars!
As always the food was awesome.  Got the Palace Pan roast with linguine (instead of rice) and it was delicious.  Very big portions. . . Didn't care for the long wait but that's our fault for going during prime lunch hours. Avoid going between 11 and 2 if possible. Can't wait to go back next time I'm in town.
The pan roast was out of this world good.  The gumbo was some of the best i have ever tasted.  Food is prepared in front of you.  You can order your own level of heat.  The downside is no reservations and generally a long wait since the bar seats 18.We got lucky, only a 25 minute wait late at night. The bar is located in an older hotel off the strip, but you need to go there and eat some great food at very reasonable prices for what you get.
The closest to Louisiana you can get here in Vegas! But be very prepared to wait in line for an hour or two in busy nights, they can o let seat 16 at a time. Unless if you want to come at 3am since they're now open 24hrs.. . You have to go with the combo pan roast with extra seafood. It's the original favorite here. 1-10 spice choice. Go with 4 to 5 if you want to taste your seafood instead of the heat.  The oysters can be pretty big and fresh anytime, go figure, it has no after taste. I've had the oyster shots and they're good too. The jambalaya is just so so. Your best choice is the pan roast combo here.. . Depending on the chef you could be waiting for hours or not. People will wait in line and I guess that's why they're confident to take their time too other than they know they deliver what you crave for when it comes to Cajun/creole food.
I've heard the big rave about Oyster Bar.  We got the combo pan roast which was really good.  I love that it has a piece of lobster in it too!  I've had pan roast in LA and I can say this one here was pretty good.  The pan roast is about 24 bucks and a $5 charge for sharing, but it was fine.  We got an extra bowl of rice.  I really could not stop eating the pan roast, it was that good!  Make sure you ask a worker at Palace Station if you can't find Oyster Bar!
Yummy Pan Roast! I came here after a late night of hitting the Vegas Clubs. And boy there was a wait. Ending up waiting an hour here but it was worth it. You sit the bar area and order your food. Honestly, the Pan Roast is all you need. The sauce was perfect.
Its such a gem off the strip.  Its actually a bar (so hide your children or your wife).  The portions are gigantic but watch out for the $5 sharing fee.  Since there's only about 20 seats and typically a huge line, come during the off hours like breakfast.  The chef is also hilarious.  Here's an interaction we saw with a customer:. "Where is the oysters from". "The water". "Which water?". "Walmart". . "How do you cook it?". "With Magic". . Would definitely come back here just for entertainment.
Oysters and PAN ROAST, OH MY! . . The waiting game: . This part of my dining experience was no joke! I waited for an hour and half to get seated! It was WORTH it!. . Food: . . Oysters:. Fresh and delicious!  The cocktail sauce with horseradish on the side was great at masking the fishy taste of the oysters. My only complaint is that I wished the portions were bigger. . . Combo pan roast: . This big bowl of goodness is something that you cannot find anywhere else.  The best way I can describe the dish is that it is a creamy/ cheesy soup with crab, shrimp, and lobster and a side of rice. Delicious yes, but you will definitely have a FOOD COMA for days, so prepare yourself!. . Service: . Since this restaurant is literally a bar table with 12 seats, there was only one chef and waitress doing everything.  The chef Bob and I cannot recall the name of the waitress made it a very enjoyable experience when I was there. They kept cracking jokes throughout my whole time there and on top of that, they were fast and efficient with everything. NO COMPLAINTS.    . . Final Verdict: . I dreaded the wait but loved my experience here , so YES I will be back!
Outstanding as always.   There's always a line here,  and it's  obvious why once you get your meal. I've been coming here for 20 years.
Food:  My fiancee ordered the pan roast and I ordered the gumbo.  Hands down, pan roast is AWESOME.  This place also serves the best gumbo I had ever tried.. . Food rating:  5/5. . Service:  Service here is decent and is mostly busy.. . Service rating:  4/5. . Price:  Expect to pay $20+. . Overall:  I must come here every time I'm in Vegas.
After hearing about this place from friends and fellow Yelpers, I had to check it out for myself. Oyster Bar is located inside the Palace Station casino and seats only 18 people. There was about 6 people waiting in line ahead of us at around 3am, and we were seated a little over an hour after arriving. The chefs were friendly and worked as fast as they could, but food took about 20-30 minutes to be served. I decided on a half dozen oysters ($10 between 1-9am) and the highly raved about Combo Pan Roast ($23.99). . . The oysters were freshly shucked and some of the best I've ever had. I can't compare my pan roast to other places since I've never had it before, but it's a really thick stew made out of brandy, tomato and cream. The Combo Pan Roast was full of large pieces of crab, lobster and shrimp and had the perfect amount of spice for my taste at a level 8. It was super rich, creamy, and absolutely delicious. The serving was enough for two people, so I had plenty to take home with me. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!
Very late late dinner or very early early breakfast.... 2 hours of waiting, worth it!!!
The wait for this place is really long, but I already knew that from the reviews. We went to eat at about 10:45 PM and it took us about 1-1/2 to 2 hours to get seated. I've eaten here before but it was many years ago and I have been wanting to eat the clam linguine from here for a while. When we were finally seated, I ordered the New England clam chowder and the linguine and clams with a 2 heat (spice). Mike had the New England clam chowder and the Palace Pan Roast with a 6 heat (spice). They serve a sourdough bun with your order. I really liked the bun (with butter) and asked for more. The clam chowder was good too. Of course my FAVORITE was the linguine with clams. Mike's Palace Pan Roast was also good, although I would've liked more rice to go with it. Yes, I ate some of his food too :)
i waited 2 hours in line  yes excellent like every one say pan roast combo the bomb chef and waiter excellent  long wait  but worth it
