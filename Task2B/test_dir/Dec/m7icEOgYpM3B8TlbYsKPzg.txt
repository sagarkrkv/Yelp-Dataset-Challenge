The cast is talented.  Female dancer are great!  . . Comics were really bad though....seemed very PG humor and outdated jokes to me.  Absinthe is much more clever and hilarious.  . . Some of the acts are very nice, such as the girls in the fish bowl.  . . I liked the whip girls and the dancer with long hair.  I felt the costumes need updating though.  They are pretty cheap looking compared to other cirque shows.
It's basically an acrobatic variation of a burlesque show. It's not the best Cirque du Soleil production, but it certainly is not the worst. It's definitely very entertaining, and there are some beautiful performances, such as the water bowl performance and the bath tub performance. If you are uncomfortable with nudity and raunchy jokes, this would not be for you. There's no full on nudity, but expect topless women and men in G-strings. Sparkly G-strings. Their comedy is not for the timid either, and avoid the front row and aisle seats at all costs if you don't want to be part of the show. If you want something classier than Thunder down under/Chip and Dales, and are willing to pay a higher price for it, then this would be the show to watch. I would say that they exceeded my expectations, but I can see why many would be disappointed in the show if they were expecting a typical Cirque du Soleil performance.
My third Cirque de Soleil show!! All the shows I've watched were so different. Ka had all the crazy acrobatics. The Beetles had alot of singing and dancing. And this one was very sensual and sexual with a lot of topless people. I know what you're all thinking.. that sounds like a.... but it's not. Even though there are topless people running around, it was done with sophistication and class lol. . . I really enjoyed the show. It was very fun and lively. The person running the show was super funny. There was a variety of acts. Some acrobatic, some dances, some stand up. I love that all the music was live. They had a band and singers do all the music. They included the audience whenever they could. That was fun to watch. (one guy got called to participate with another girl from the crowd.. and his girlfriend left the show). We sat in the lower section 5-6 rows from the stage and it was perfect. It wasn't one of those big crazy stages where you need to sit at least half way back. It was a very entertaining show! . . TAKEAWAYS . + There is some nudity, so don't bring your kids! . + Very risque ;)
Great show. Don't sit in the first two rows unless you want to be part of the show. Most of the seats had a good view of the stage. We will be back with friends
Loved this show. Much smaller venue, performamce group, and crowd than the other cirque shows I have seen. We had a front row couch which was super comfy. The big eddy drinks we purchased were strong and we'll worth the money. The show itself was great- fun audience involvement. Not a show that the super-conservative would enjoy as there are all types of jokes and visuals of sexual behaviors (you would think anyone purchasing tickets would realize this but who knows). We were bummed when the show ended- we wanted more.
Truly an adult show. Not for people who are uncomfortable about sex and sex topics. Don't seat near the stage because you may get called on. Just remember it's all in good fun (we did see a wife extremely upset and leave the show...it was not her husband's fault, you can't control what a person in the audience does especially if they are very drunk). I thought this show was tastefully done. Favorite part was the fish bowl, lady with hula-hoops, the madem was funny, witty, and entertaining. The comic relief group in between acts were very funny and interacted with the audience.
Before Zumanity, the last time I saw boobies in a handstand was at a strip club near Bayonne, NJ! Don't tell wifey.. . If you're reading this, you're probably wondering if Zumanity is for you. Answer these questions to find out:. . Do you like the "I can't believe they said that" comedy stylings of Jim Jeffries, Dave Attell, and Louis CK?. . Do phallic objects, flickering tongues, and crotch thrusting amuse you?. . Are enormous trannies in your "I'm cool with that" wheelhouse?. . If so, you'll have a grand ol' time at Zumanity! If not, don't be like the reviewer down below who was offended about tigole bitties (actually they're small--dancers aren't known for being top heavy, you know) and genital jokes.. . That being said, Zumanity isn't a 5 star show. While the cast is talented, some of the acts are more comedy/audience interaction rather than backflip bonanza.. . As far as sexiness goes, I'm a man who knows his way around tawdry sites that end in "Hub", but I gotta say, there was one act that made me a bit uncomfortable. Not sure why. Maybe it went on too long. Maybe I'm more stimulated via audio versus visual. Who knows? All I know is once the act had been going on for a couple of minutes I was ready for it to end.. . If you can get seats at a decent price, it's worth a visit. Otherwise, I must advise you to check out Absinthe instead.
I was blown away by the show. Can't believe we waited so long to see it. Loved it big time.
I'm torn on Zumanity.  It really held my interest in the beginning.  The acts were great and the comedians were funny.  But about 45 minutes in, I was checking my watch.  The two girls in the big water glass thing were great, and the midget with the curtain thingies was amazing too!!  There was also a chain/swing act that was amazing.  I think that if the show would have been maybe 30 minutes shorter I would have been happy with it.  I wouldn't go see this again, but I don't regret going.  I did prefer Absinthe to this though.
A MUST GO SHOW. I went to this show with my boyfriend and we were amused. This show is sensual, funny, elegant but cynic and most definitely entertaining, all in one bowl. . The cast is very talented and deliver the show with excellence. There is for sure a lot of skin showing, some pleasing and some not as much but it does not fall into  vulgarity...girls, don't worry if you feel this will only please your man's eyes, there is time for the ladies as well to take a peak of some good looking man's skin as well =) . . Tip: I will not recommend you to sit in the front if you're shy as after the show the host will interact with the audience that is sitting upfront.
Went to see this show last week  at New York New York. Show was great. Funny, entertaining, sexy and interactive. Would highly recommend it. Bar drinks were large and they don't skimp on the booze. Bourbon and seven drink was $20 for 32 oz. Show was $206 for two people with good seats. The only thing I didn't like  was the incense they walk around with.
This is a super amazing show and probably the best I've ever seen in Vegas. I guess the only other show I saw was O. It's very interactive with the audience who are sitting near the front and extremely, extremely sensual. There are lots of boobs and butts. I didn't know there was going to be so much nudity. From an artistic point of view, the whole show is very beautiful celebrating the beauty of the human body and acrobatics. From a perverted point of view, non-stop boobs galore!. . Beware if you're planning on your with kids/parents--it may get awkward quick.. . This is a great show for a date--try to snag one of the love seats for 2 up front when you're buying your tickets. Then again, great show for anyone!
Meh. I love Cirque, in fact I'd count myself as a super fan (having seen every show that I can get to in LA, Vegas, NYC or SF). I first saw Zumanity back in 2004-ish. It was sexy, fun, entertaining and sure adult, just enough, perfect. So I took my husband for his birthday (dinner and a show in Vegas, nice ;-). We both left disappointed and with raging headaches. Where was the Cirque in this show? I saw drag, boobs, lewd jokes and minor acro feats. What I missed was the charm, the sensuality and awe that most Cirque shows offer in spades. You can see the aforementioned sexy XXX anywhere in Vegas. My advice to the consumer- decide what you want if it's raunch go elsewhere, if it's Cirque try O. To the Cirque team- try harder to stay on brand and revert back to the show as it was 10 years ago or take your name off this show. Zumanity is not worth the time or money, sorry.
Meh. This was my 5th Cirque show, and it was the worst. 90% dancing and 10% of acrobatics. I get the appeal, burlesque. However, I feel that people are distracted with all the boobs bouncing around to actually recognize that the show wasn't as extraordinary as you would expect a Cirque show to be. The music was cheesy, I had flashes of Rock of Ages and I'm not quite sure what the point of the male stripper was as it wasn't even good dancing (disclaimer: guys dancing in speedos not a turn on for me. However, if he fixes my garbage disposal I will swoon). Cute and funny at times? Sure. Jaw dropping performances? Nope.
My significant other wanted me to go to a Cirque du Soleil show.  The Cirque shows at the MGM and other places were $80+ for terrible seats.  I suggested Zumanity because the tickets were a lot cheaper and the venue was a lot smaller.  The front desk at our hotel (MGM) gave us a free booklet with a list of shows and things to see in Vegas.  There was a coupon inside for Zumanity buy one ticket get another for $10.  We ended up getting tickets for the third row at the box office in New York, New York. . . We knew it was an "adult" show, but I didn't know what to expect besides some frontal nudity.  It is definitely not a show to take your parents to see (although I did see a mom and adult son).  There are a number of sexual and topless aspects of the show.  The MC is a drag queen and he was great and hilarious.  The show has great humor, jokes, audience interaction, and there is something for most sexual preferences and desires.  There are some gay and lesbian aspects - this may be off putting to some people - my view is what ever floats your boat.  Even if the main scene was not your thing (gay, midgets, cross dressers), there were usually people in the background doing something.  So even if the concept of a three way with one girl and two guys is not interesting to you... you can check out the topless girl dancing in the background.. . There are some acrobats in the show, but the main focus is on sexual themes.  The crowd was a great mix of people: old, young, hetero, homo, foreign, and interracial couples.  Minor comment: the female performers are (mostly) in great shape so they are a little low on the cup size.
What a fun show! My wife and I went on December 29th 2014, and had a great time!  It was funny yet sensual. Some great acrobatic acts as well as some flesh made this a must see show.
