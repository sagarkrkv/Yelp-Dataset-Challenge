Probably some of the best all you can eat sushi in Vegas. However, note that the wait is usually quite long, especially for large parties. If you do have a large party, you'll likely be seated in the private room on the side. This sometimes causes service to be rather slow due to difficulties getting a servers attention from this area. Also, if you do have a large party, I would recommend not ordering too much food at a time, as it can cause some delays in getting the food. Maybe even ordering some appetizers when you first get seated would be a good idea.. . Aside from their main menu, they have some menu items on their paper place mats that you may miss out on if you're not careful. One the side menu, I would definitely recommend would be the Pork Belly (only on the dinner menu though). It is amazing. That is all. As far as nigiri and rolls, just pick what you think you'd like. . . Definitely don't forget to leave a little room for dessert! I would recommending trying the lychee sorbet (which is amazing), mochi, green tea ice cream, and green tea creme brulee.. . Come famished, leave full and almost unable to move.
I love the fact that they literally have all you can eat mochi dessert!! The food is great also the pork belly.
This is a small Sushi house. You will most likely have a 20 to thirty minute wait. But it is well worth it . Did the all you can eat for $27.00 the flavor was amazing.
The AYCE here is average price - $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner. My few favorite things here are the white tuna, fresh scallop, fresh wasabi, and the non-ice cream desserts. . . My first time trying the fresh scallop was here at Goyemon. The scallop was so breath-taking that it almost made me want to write a haiku. It was citrusy, fresh, and perfectly textured. . . The non-ice cream desserts here are also arguably the most delicious compared to other sushi restaurants. At least try the creme brulee and chocolate pudding/souffle and you'll thank me later.. . My not-so-favorite things here: the service, especially of the sushi chefs when sitting at the bar. If you're working for tips, you've got to earn them, people!
My all time favorite sushi spot. TOURISTS do no waste your time eating sushi on the strip. I cannot tell you how many bad experiences I have had eating sushi on the strip, along with a horrifying bill to follow. Goyemon is fresh, affordable, and unique. Open late, and offer a great lunch all you can eat price! They truly have a flavor, rather than everything tasting like the same roll like other places. Their fish is very fresh, service is quick and attentive. I will continue to come to Goyemon as long as I reside in Vegas.
Waaaaay over priced for substandard sushi... Not sure why there is always a line. I definitely would not have waited the hour and a half that they quoted me a couple of weeks ago. I would rather drive the 30 minutes to North Vegas for awesome food, than go around the corner to waste money. Don't recommend you eat here.
I'm gonna come out right off the bat and say I was pretty disappointed. I had heard this place hyped upby some friends and was really looking forward to trying it out. Even checked out some of the other people's pics and I had to say the pics looked pretty impressive. Well then I got here. With the friend who hyped it up I might add, and I gotta say what a let down.  No wagyu/Kobe beef sushi. No salmon belly. The sushi to rice ratio was pretty sorry as well. I was expecting a hell of a lot more. In actuality, I'm giving the stars primarily for the AYCE mochi ice cream and the pork belly. Those were pretty damn good. But the sushi was average at best. Now I'm not sure if I got there on a bad day, what the deal was but it was a letdown. I'll give it a shot on another day maybe but the sushi I was served looked nothing like the pictures that I seen people post on here.
What a disappointment. I came here about two months ago and had a wonderful experience. I was so excited to go back to Goyemon and introduce this to my friends but instead I left disappointed, unsatisfied and embarrassed! The sushi was not fresh - they didn't even have the Wagyu/Kobe beef and the waitress wasn't very friendly. In fact, the she seemed really annoyed to be there. When I asked questions about the sushi rolls, she literally rolled her eyes! . . Not only did I leave unhappy, I was so embarrassed how I hyped this place up to my friends. They weren't impressed either. It looks I won't be coming back here for a while. I hope they step up their game. Sigh. I guess I'm back to looking for a new AYCE sushi bar when I'm in Vegas.. . The only good thing about this place is that the dessert (mochi ice cream) is AYCE.
Came in w/ a friend around lunch time for their ayce. . . Love the dim ambiance here. As for the food, their nigiri here compared to other ayce around the valley is the best - the ratio of fish and rice is perfect! The fish here tastes very yummy, and the cuts are large & dense. One thing I didn't like though was their specialty rolls :( Ordered a few half specialty rolls & I didn't think any tasted unique or really good. I drowned my sorrows eating red bean ice cream to mask the taste from forcefully eating certain rolls.. LOL . . I'll just stick to nigiri, hand rolls, anything eel, and dessert here. I regret not waiting for their dinner ayce instead. I wanted to try their uni and sweet shrimp nigiri, as well as their green tea desserts (cake, creme brulee) but they were dinner only! Oh well, next time.. . Our server was friendly, she refilled waters and such without us asking in a timely matter. However, the time to wait for our orders was EXTREMELY SLOW especially when restaurant wasn't even packed today. Thankfully the time limit for ayce didn't apply to us but if it did, then we'd only have 2 orders .__." Maybe new sushi chefs? Idk.. . As the receptionist handed our checks, we were offered their stamp cards, which I would've forgot if he didn't remind me! After ten ayce, the eleventh is free. They do have a expiration date of one year. So it is pretty much treating yourself out every month :p Their stamp cards also works at Sushi-Mon. I live closer to Sushi-Mon but my school is closer to Goyemon, so that's perfect! We'll be back :)
This place is still too good to be true for me! Can`t wait to make it back to Vegas. While writing this review I have the sudden urge of driving 5hrs just for this! . . Goyemon had me at "ALL YOU CAN EAT." - Smart Guy. . Write it down son
Everytime we come here we always order the all you can eat sushi menu. Lunch is $21.96 & dinner is $26.95. If there is a long wait, sit at the bar :) we prefer to sit at the bar since we can order directly from the sushi chef. Quality if the sushi is really good & staff are really friendly. We wish that we could order more than one order per person for uni, ama ebi, & green tea creme brulee
I love this place! Usually we go to Sushi Mon but this location is closer to the Strip. I've been here for both lunch and dinner and they are both equally delicious. In fact my love for this place may be just a little bit more than Sushi Mon since they give minimal rice for the sushi.. . Service is great. Be sure to check the board for their daily lunch/dinner specials. Get here early so you don't have to wait!. . The AYCE price can not be beat for the quality you get. Can't wait to be back here the next time we are in Vegas!
**Long story short**:. Hands down, best ayce sushi I've ever been to! 45 min ordering limit (which is plenty imo) but they remind you with a last call. They have the freshest garlic ahi tuna nigiri that is a must try. About the same price as all other ayce sushi but waaaay better quality. Desserts included! Service can be a bit spotty but the sushi is so good you won't be disappointed. . . **Full story**:. How have I not written a review for this place yet?! I guess all the partying in vegas makes me forget about the great food I eat afterwards...lol. . Anyway, I've frequented this place every time I've come to vegas after I turned 21 and it is the best ayce sushi restaurant I've ever dined at and I've definitely visited my fair share! . . I love that this place isn't overly packed even on holiday weekends; I've been here during EDC weekend and memorial day weekend. It's definitely a hidden gem just a few minutes off the strip. . . The ordering system is a little different here than most other ayce sushi restaurants. Instead of giving you 3 rounds to order, they give you a 45 min limit. So you don't get a little sheet of paper that you check off, you just keep ordering from the waiters until your time is up. Your time starts when you order your first item. I haven't had a problem with this being not enough time especially since they give you a last call. However, I haven't been here when it's super packed so I can foresee that possibly being a problem for some people but haven't experienced it myself. . . J casually ordered the garlic ahi tuna along with the rest of our rolls and sushi not knowing that it was going to be probably the best tuna both of us have ever tasted. The tuna was so fresh it was literally ruby red and glistening as it came out. I have never seen a more appealing cut of sushi. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-house-goyemon-las-vegas?select=q8fozGYfWJbBHNHrfUgAsg#UnDx5-6zuPhFOyzBufRpSw The slightly tangy sauce that dressed the tuna was perfect and didn't require any soy sauce! We ended up ordering about 10 more orders of the tuna alone LOL. . . The appetizers are pretty standard and the rolls are good too. If you read closely, you can find the rolls that are in smaller portions, about 4 pieces, which is great because you can try a bit of everything without getting too full. I'd definitely recommend coming here with a larger group so you can sample everything but even with only 2 people you can still try a variety of things.. . The price is about $25 total for lunch and if you upgrade to dinner price during lunch, you can order uni and sweet shrimp as well! I'm not a fan of either so I'm content coming here and paying less for lunch :) . . Anyway, definitely check this place out and TRY THE GARLIC AHI TUNA. I dream about that stuff man.
The service was good but the food was great!  Sushi was fresh and the green tea flan was delicious!
This is my hands down favorite ayce sushi spot in all of vegas. I never leave disappointed and I know the menu by heart. The only downside is depending on the time you go their may or may not be a wait, however they have integrated this "text you when your table is ready" system which is actually quite convenient. I mean the service isn't really all that great, but it is also not that bad so i'll live. Definitely one of the better spots to grab sushi in vegas.
This place blows anus.. Small portions, awful service, and just the worst. If you like sushi come to francisco and I'll take to the best spot in town.
I've gone here the last few times in Vegas with my friends.. . Must say, quality is good and the cuts if sushi are cute and small, but it is ayce. My favorites are:. -Salmon. -yellowtail. -White tuna. . Good selection and service is very fast and efficient. My go to sushi place in Vegas.
Avid sushi lover & this was our second visit. We should have stuck with our regular go-to sushi joint.  The service was slacking & portion size of the fish was so tiny compared to others we've tried. It was just an ok experience rather than a good one. Not so much of the hype & not worth the wait at midnight on a Wednesday.
Horrible service! Totally diappointed. I know they probably dont care negative review because so many people come here. I know they are busy but doesn't mean you can ignore cuatomers who wait in line for over 20 mins just try to put the name down. And some people just cut the line and go up to put the name down and totally got ignored by the lady!!!
Best sushi in Las Vegas!!! Would definitely go back again
Only place I would eat sushi and other great japanese sides. Sushi are always fresh and comes in bite size. We also love the salmon collar, pork belly, shiitake mushroom, and all their specials. This has become our 'must eat' place whenever we come to Vegas. Highly recommended for everyone. With the amount of food devoured, it's totally worth the price :)
I know not everybody comes for the sweet shrimp and uni, but I do.  It's Sunday 5:45pm and they are out of uni. Seriously? Its not even 6 yet. And we asked our waitress if we can get two orders of sweet shrimp sushi since they are out of uni, and the waitress gave us a short answer, "no." And that was it.  . . I come to this place every time I'm Vegas, but I don't know if I will return after this.. . Dessert time - another server is serving us and now they are out of green tea and red bean ice cream (which is all they have) and tempura ice cream.  She said its year end so they are out food.... So, how often does your restaurant stock up ...?
Best AYCE sushi buffet!!!. The wait is long because the restaurant is very small.. I think the capacity of seats were only 60 people, if I saw it correctly.  But being small allows the staff to be more attentive, which was great!. . The wait was around 90 minutes, but it was worth the wait.  Also, they have an awesome system that allows you to track your standing.. . It's different from other AYCE buffets.  The servers still come and take your order and all you have to do is stuff your faces lol.  . . The quality of food is awesome.. Everything on their menu was fresh and enjoyable.. Some of the ones that we enjoyed the most were the fresh salmon nigiris, shrimp tempera, eel, 911, and something ruby roll.  Make sure you get the half(4pieces) orders so you can try as many as you can. . . Seriously, I think I was so stuffed to the point I felt sick... which I don't recommend but it was definitely worth the visit.  Will probably make it our go to place in vegas! . . Oh, and don't forget the Mochi ice cream and Lychee sorbet!!! Perfect ending to the meal.
ack.  cant give it more than two stars.  the poor staff was overworked, and that impeded my ability to order, out of common courtesy.  we sat at the bar, and the sushi chef had to handle orders from five people at the bar AND orders from the restaurant.  it just made it uncomfortable to keep ordering.  for once, i left an ayce sushi place feeling just okay full. . . they also did not have uni for the day and declined to offer an extra order of sweet shrimp per person.  was def looking forward to uni.. . the fish is fresh but sliced a bit thin.  quality is decent.  hotate was topped off with yuzu which was excellent.. . handrolls seem like a good deal, as the specialty rolls had too high a ratio of rice to fish.
Went back a few weeks ago. Not sure if the owner changed or what. The service is not the same, the menu have complete changed. It takes about 20 minutes to get 1 order out to us, and the sushi chef always give you attitudes. (Mind you that I set at the sushi bar). Will definitely not be returning.
Came here for dinner w/ the fam last night because of the reviews my sister saw here on Yelp.. . Got here around 5:15, and got seated right away. Not too long after we started eating, did the wait go from 0 to an hour and a half! Guess we walked in at just the right time.. . Food came pretty quickly. My sister even said her "ecstasy roll" was the best sushi she's had in a super long time! Sushi was good and fresh, but the salmon collar I ordered was nothing like I've ever tasted. Over cooked and dry, makes for not a happy foodie. Mom and dad both ordered a salmon dinner special, and both their salmon came out the same as the collar. We were a bit disappointed, seeing as this IS a sushi house. . .  Service was friendly, ambience is nice, and the sushi was good. I'd come back despite the salmon fail, I just wouldn't order it again.
