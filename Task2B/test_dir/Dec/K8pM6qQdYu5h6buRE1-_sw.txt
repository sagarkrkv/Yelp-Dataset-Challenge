Pretty unbelievable treatment.. . I was blown away at the snarky and down right RUDE attitude of one of the employees, possibly the manager.   I had supported Lo Lo's as a local business for years, even before they went all corporate.. . Well this visit was quite different.  . . I kindly asked this man, who may have been the manager, to turn please turn down the TV volume.  Immediately he told me "take your phone and go outside".  I said it had nothing to do with my phone, and that he had quite an attitude towards a customer. He then continued to tell me why he was NOT going to turn it down.  . . I cannot and will not support a business that treats it's paying customer with such disrespect.  He obviously has some chip on his shoulder.  Not to mention that the food is grossly over priced now that they are a franchise type entity.  $12 for a ham omelette.  I can go to the 5nDiner and get better food and better service at a cheaper price.
Delicious classic chicken and waffles, good biscuits and gravy, supremely nice wait staff.  The chicken basically falls right off the bone.  My Belgian girlfriend approved of the waffles, so they win all the way around.. . I would not advise coming here on a diet.
Friends took me last night and we waited about 15 minutes even though we were told 30 minutes. Everyone was so nice especially our waitress. Dj was playing music which I enjoyed, but not too loud that you cannot here your conversation. Games on TV for those keeping eye on scores. . Food:  We ordered fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, waffles, salmon patties, collards, green beans and cornbread.  Everything was hot and delicious along with a melon margarita.. Thanks to my friends for introducing me to Lo Lo's I will be back soon.
Met with friends from work today and it was my first visit to this restaurant. Parking is nearly impossible and their entire parking lot is valet...so you'll need to park on the surrounding streets, or pay. The restaurant was really busy when we were there and the food took a little while, but not a big deal. I had the omelette and it was huge!! It was really good and I took most of our home and easily have another couple meals with it. When it came time to go, we asked for a refill and was told that they weren't free. Seriously?! I can't remember being in a place that didn't offer free refills. Overall the staff was alright, but I actually like the atmosphere at Mrs. White's a lot better and everybody is really friendly.
I hate to say it, but I am finally done with Lo-Lo's. . . The first time I ever went there it was wonderful. It was in this small house and the atmosphere and food was amazing with wonderful service. Then they moved.. . I work pretty close so one time a coworker and I called in a lunch take-out order. From my prior experience of them being so busy I called well ahead of time to ensure it would be ready when I got there. It wasn't. I waited an extra half an hour and was told it was my fault because I called so early. Rude.. . Regardless, the food was amazing and I wasn't going to let that ruin a restaurant for me. Went there once more with my boyfriend and had great food and great service. A few more times had take-out and they were all a success. . . Then my boyfriend and I took two of our friends there for a greasy hangover breakfast since they had never been there before. We were told the wait would be 40 mins. After an hour my boyfriend asked what had happened and they told us we missed it when we were called. Annoying but hey, maybe it was our fault and we sat back down expecting to be first in line. The hostess then came out and seated a group of like six who had gotten there way after us. Annoyed and STARVING we gave up and left. And I looked over at the hostess just livid and she looked right back at me with this smug look on her face.. . Today was definitely the last straw. We ordered take-out and apparently they no longer accept payment upon arrival. You have to pay with a card up front. Thankfully I work at a bank and have an ATM on campus so I could deposit the cash into my account for the $70 order we made. They said we needed the card and ID to pick up the order and I told her I was sending someone else to pick it up, the girl on the phone told me she would make an exception as long as he had those two items. And of course they told my coworker when he got there they can't do that but luckily gave him the food. The chicken was dry and tiny and the waffles were super thin. . . I'm just over it. Now that Welcome Chicken and Donuts opened I'll just go there instead. They always have good service and the chicken is amazing. I'm sad that such a Phoenix staple has gone so down hill.
Absolutely delicious, flawless chicken and waffles.  A must-try if you love fried chicken and/or waffles.. . One item of note though: coffee is $3.  Yes, three dollars.  It was fine, but I think I paid about six times what I would have paid at Starbucks.  So that seemed a bit high to me.  However, the food was delicious and well worth it.. . A very cool vibe, clean, bright, well-maintained with great photos and art all over the place.  Gospel music playing loud at 7AM on a Friday morning.  A great waitress.  A lot of fun.
Unfortunately, it's fallen a lot from what it used to be. We were up from Tucson last night and this was the first we'd been to the new building and probably the last.  The chicken was nothing like it used to be.  We made the mistake of coming late, so there was nothing but chicken and waffles available.  No catfish or greens.  They have drinks, but only from their short drink menu.  The old LoLo's was always worth a special trip, but sadly the new incarnation doesn't live up to expectations.
I've eaten here a couple of times and I really like this place. If you are not in the mood for chicken and waffles, don't worry. They have an extensive menu that is sure to please various taste buds, and you definitely get a good bang for your buck. I indulged in a nice country style meal (pic below) and was thoroughly satisfied. I didn't feel as if I had missed out on the chicken and waffles because my plate was so good. For dessert, if you like banana pudding, definitely give it a try. It tastes great and has a good ratio of bananas to cookies. On top of that, it's served in a mason jar! . . Service here is great. However, if you dine in on a Sunday afternoon, expect to wait...like at all good restaurants.
Love Lolos!!! Been here several times. I have a Georgia Peach cocktail and Bettys Boob. (Waffle and chicken breast)  i have also had the signature chicken sandwich (award winning) and the waffle sandwich which was delish. Cant go wrong here it seems with the menu, drinks and atmosphere. Hood dining at its finest as their motto says...
