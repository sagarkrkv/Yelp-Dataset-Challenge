The surf 'n turf quesadilla I got here was really good, but it was pretty small for the price ($13?). My friends seemed to enjoy their burgers and milkshakes.. . Would come back here again, seems like a decent spot to land if you're at Cosmo.
I've been here a few times and feel like this place deserves a 4 because they continue to have good food and good service. We enjoyed our medium-well  burgers but next time we'll probably go with medium being that the patty could've been juicer.  But still, not bad. We split two burgers between the two of us since we both had mentioned we wanted to try them. The Fun-ghi burger was absolutely delicious! You can taste the truffle in every bite. Truffle and Gruyere cheese in the same burger? Perfection! The Gold Standard is their most popular burger and I can see why. They took the all-classic cheeseburger and deconstructed it. First, the cheese isn't just your typical cheddar, it's an aged goat cheddar. Second, instead of adding a thick slice of tomato, that usually creates a mess and ends up sliding out anyway, they added a tomato confit! Lettuce was replaced with arugula which gave the burger a lot of flavor. Bacon, bacon, bacon! And for the best part instead of plain mayo this burger had a garlic chive aioli. Ah-maze-ing! This changed the whole dynamic of the burger! Honestly, I don't even remember what the buns were like because I was too busy enjoying all the unique flavors inside. The only downside to our meal was that I was so excited to have the "unndon" cake for dessert that I skipped on the raved about shakes. I came to find that it was a seasonal item that is no longer on the menu. Seriously?! Until they bring that back I am not returning. Take a look at the pictures others posted of it and tell me that does not look amazing? If you don't think so, then there's something definitely wrong with you. Sorry. We ended up getting the Dulce de leche cheesecake because #1 I love anything DDL and #2 it said it had Frosted Flakes cereal in/on. Normally, I wouldn't even eat cheesecake unless it's the Godiva or S'mores ones from The Cheesecake Factory but the description made this one hard to skip. It had the perfect consistency, too! The densely moist cracker crust underneath tasted like a combination of crushed gingerbread man and snicker doodle cookies. Salivating much? For the perfect bite you have to start at the top, taking a bit of the whipped cream, FF cereal, cheesecake and then sweep it all up with the trail of oozing caramel sitting next to it. Yummmmm-meee!! Now remember, their desserts are seasonal so hurry in!
This place does not disappoint!  My husband and I shared the Gold Standard and Steakhouse burgers and the both of us were very impressed at how layered the flavors are, especially the Gold Standard!  I also had a vegan milkshake (I think it's the only one on the menu) and it was AWESOME!  I cannot wait to get back to Vegas to have another.
Their kimchi burger is interesting. But I may have been expecting too much, how can a burger place serve a good kimchi dish?? However, the burger itself is juicy and melt in your mouth.
Inattentive servers who seemed more worried about looking cute then service. I ordered the gold standard burger which was good, but just ok, and a coke. I was with a group of 6 and for some reason my burger wasn't delivered until after everyone at my table had finished there meal. Also, I was never given the coke after asking for it multiple times. When I got my bill (everyone had separate checks), the coke was still on and when I brought it to the servers attention, she said she would take care of it. I was then brought my change with a coke in a to-go container and it still on the bill. In addition to auto-gratuity it was $30. So not worth it! I recommend Gordan Ramsey Burgr across the street at Planet Hollywood!
If you're looking for a good pre game or post game spot, this place is ideal. They make a solid burger, good fries and the best alcoholic milk shakes I've ever had. The service is nice and the room is nice and clean. They hostesses are really pretty and the prices are right where you'd expect.
This place used to be delicious! . . After talking to the wait staff and prying them for information. It seems the managers/owner tried to cut cost by getting cheaper meats/items/etc.. . The last 2-3 times here the quality of the food has definitely gone down hill. I won't be coming back. I really did enjoy it so much before, but I won't be coming back for these expensive prices and lacking quality.. . They get a good reputation, then try to cut corners? They still pull in customers that go off the old rating? - oh well, I'll just go to bachi burger then!
I'm posting this review on behalf of my husband who has repeatedly proclaimed "best burger ever!!"  Group agrees though - burgers are delicious here!!
Popular casual dining spot in the Cosmopolitan hotel.. . Came here since hubby raved about their burgers here from a previous trip without me, so we stopped here for lunch. Kid friendly place.. . Huge selection of milkshakes that you can order with or without alcohol - I had the pecan turtle one... it probably has as many calories and fat as what I ate for the rest of the day, but definitely a nice treat. Rich creamy ice cream with all the goodness of pecans and chocolate as well! It's about $4 less than the posted price if you order one without alcohol.. . Their burger selection is impressive. I sampled hubby's classic gold standard and thought it tasted good. I had the funghi burger and the tastes went well together with a touch of truffle, but it was a bit too greasy for my liking.. . Delicious onion rings! Average fries.. . Good service and decent burgers but I thought it was a bit expensive for lunch (about $30 pp).
I had the Lamb burger, and my wife had I think the mushroom burger.  Our food was very prompt, tasty, and decently presented.  Definitely will be coming back here for a bite next time in in town!
Burgers, fries, and a shake. Give me those at Holstein's, and I'm a happy camper.. . It's located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas right outside of the Marquee club. One of my favorite places to get some food in Vegas.. . The service is a little below average, which is the only thing preventing them from receiving 5 stars. The server just seemed disinterested in serving not only us, but everyone around us.. . The food, on the other hand, is delish!. . Nom Nom Burger ($17.50). Chips inside a burger just reminds me of my childhood days when I used to do that with french fries. Throw in a fried egg for another dollar or two and this burger is golden. I get my burger medium-rare, and I'm in heaven when I'm devouring the Nom Nom.. . Vanilla Milkshake ($9). A little pricey, but you can share a milkshake with someone else. They give you a glass filled with the milkshake, and they give you the rest in a stainless steel cup, so it's like TWO millshakes. I don't like whip, so it's all milkshake and nothing else for me.. . I try to come here every time I'm at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Nice place to get some food and even catch the game. And if you're really feeling a game, the sports bet is right across from Holstein's!
Love the bigs decor on the wall. Good hamburgers.. Fries are great!
I am back for a 2nd year in a row! This time I tried the thai steak salad because I have been eating like no tomorrow on this trip. I needed some ruffage to counter all the food! The salad is on-point. The flavors reminded me of Thai yum (spicy sour) salads. We also brought 3 other newbies here and they enjoyed their meals as well. One of the better burger joints in Vegas.
This was our last meal in Vegas before heading to the airport and it was a great decision. The food was top quality for the price. It was a fun atmosphere without being too crowded. Great happy hour too. I would definitely go back after a long night of Vegas drinking.
Aside from the food poisoning and resultant vomiting and days of stomach upset that ruined my entire last 2 days in Vegas, this place is the bees knees!. . But bees don't have knees and I don't have a positive review in me for this place. 1 star for service, though. -2 stars for the awful DJ and exceptionally loud music. -countless stars for the fact that I'm still barely able to keep food down a week later. . . Also, the red velvet milkshake was terrible. The worst.
Great place, great service; Burgers don't get any better than this!
My friend and I first came here in August before seeing The Strokes at The Chealsea and we loved our meal so much we decided to come back this week before going to see Imagine Dragons at The Joint over at the Hard Rock. During our first visit I ordered the Turkey sliders and an Oreo shake so of course it was delicious, can't go wrong with a classic meal. However during this visit, I was highly disappointed in the price we paid for our meal. For this round I ordered the Turkey burger because I hadn't eaten at all that day and more for the fact I wanted to try something different, I also ordered the Pecan Cheesecake shake off the menu to try something new. When the shake came, sure it tasted delicious for the first minute but then I realized it wasn't a shake, just a bunch of milk as the taste of pecan and cheesecake disappeared by each sip and more and more milk & whip cream came to taste even after dumping it in the silver cup of seconds. I had wished I got the oreo shakebut it was too late. While waiting for our burgers I decided to start munching on the complimentary seasoned popcorn which was so delicious that when they messed up and put the goat chedder cheese on my burger instead of the regular cheedar cheese, I filled myself up with popcorn, that "milkshake" and water so by the time my fresh better tasting burger came out, I was full and didn't even want it anymore. Maybe this review will get 4 or 5 starts on my third visit however right now I can only give 1 star to the waitress who provided excellent customer service and 1 star to the free popcorn. At least I know next time just to stick with the same old turkey SLIDERS and oreo shake....hopefully they still taste good.
Incredibly good. A short way into our burgers (Longhorn burger for me with brisket, cole slaw and pickles; a mushroom and gruyere burger for David) we said, wow, these are possibly better than any place except Umami burger. As the meal went on, we decided Holsteins was giving even the venerable Umami hatch green chili burger a run for its money. It was that good. I got the Longhorn burger because I love BBQ, even though I thought the idea of brisket on a burger was silly. It wasn't. The brisket was sliced thin, and was a bit crisp - almost like a super delicious bacon. And best of all, the BBQ sauce was not cloyingly sweet. A minor criticism, I thought the cole slaw disappeared and the pickles were too dominant - maybe the quantities need adjusting. David was similarly pleased with his burger, every ingredient was distinct and very tasty especially the mushrooms. One of us got fries and the other onion rings, both were good. Service was first rate. We didn't try the shakes. We were very impressed.
MOOOOO! This place is awesome for high quality tasty burgers. . . I agree with other reviewers that the place smells kind of like a dirty mop - wtf?! Besides that, the Gold Standard burger was ridiculously good and HUGE. I was so lucky I had all that burger goodness in my stomach since I drank probably half a bottle of Goose at the Marquee (at a table, nonetheless!) I would definitely come back here if I stay at the Cosmo again. I would likely order a shake the next time since I was too full to order that during dinner. The appetizers are also pretty good. I had the bulgogi quesadilla and it was quite tasty but my only wish was that it was served warmer since it was lukewarm.
Fun place for lunch or dinner, good for a date or with a group! . I was with my hubs, his burger was perfection and my Thai beef salad was pure YUM! . The salad- a mix of hearty greens (think napa cabbage) and veggies. The beef is prepared to your liking, and is cooked perfectly. Honestly, the med-rare steak was great. Nice attention to detail, and very good. . . Fun spot with good food!
Surprisingly good burgers- then again, the restaurants at the Cosmo are generally of a high standard in the first place so it stands to reason that this one would be as well. . . In addition to burgers, menu includes shakes (duh), various appetizers, salads, and sliders. Note that shakes are available in regular as well as alcoholic versions.  Ironically, I found that the beer menu available here was more impressive than that found at B&B: Burgers and Beer.. . The Fun-Ghi: Beef Patty Topped w/ Forest Mushrooms, caramelized onion, Gruyere cheese, frisee, & Truffle mayo. Sorry Anthony Bourdain, but I'm on board the truffle appreciation train, and this is flipping delicious. Would get this again, without hesitation.. . The Longhorn burger: Beef patty topped with Texas smoked beef brisket, whiskey barbeque sauce, coleslaw, and dill pickle. This was BF's choice and as a Texan, I'm a bit more discerning about my brisket. A tasty choice, but not something I'd order again.. . Appreciated that all burgers come with a side of fries- upgrade to onion rings or sweet potato fries for a $2 charge. Even given Strip upcharges, felt pricing was fair for portion and quality given here. Service at the bar was friendly, attentive, and helpful with suggestions for a good beer based on our drinking preferences.
Loved my salty burger. The entrance smells like a dead fish!! Service is not the best But they've kept the quality burgers. The only problem was in a group of 5 that we each had a different burger at the same time we all agreed they were all very salty.  Overall good quality burgers.
This is now on my list as one of the best restaurants I've dined at in Vegas, and one of the best burgers I've ever had. My friend and I split the Gold Standard and were shocked to find out we could order it with a house-made gluten-free bun (score!). We also split the Moscow Moo milkshake with an extra shot of vodka for good measure. Our server Fabrixio (AKA Fab) was just that (fab) and even brought us out some extra goodies, including a creme de menthe meringue infused with liquid nitrogen at the end of the meal. When you bite into it, green "smoke" comes out of your mouth - so cool and super minty and refreshing. Highly recommended!
This review will be based only on the burgers. . . Since Christmas day basically consists of my mom and my boyfriend, we decided to spend some time walking on the strip and grab lunch at Holsteins.. . I ordered the Crazy Bird ($16) which was OK - not terrible, but not something I'd order again either. It was a chicken breast burger with kettle chips (more like kettle crumbs), a pickled shallot (? .. it was something pink), lettuce, and tomato. In the description it listed garlic aioli which is why I leaned towards ordering that item, but I honestly really couldn't depict it in my bites.. . Mi madre went with Captain Hook ($17) - a salmon burger with lettuce, tomato, the pickled pink stuff, and smoked salmon. That was much more worth the money and if I ever paid a visit again, that's probably what I would order. The salmon wasn't dry and the smoked salmon actually complemented very will with the grilled salmon filet, giving the burger a strong salmon kick.. . My boyfriend went with the Big Fat Greek ($17) - a burger basically with all the ingredients you'd find at a Greek restaurant like lamb, feta, lettuce, tomato, and tatziki. That was pretty tasty as well if you don't mind a hint of gaminess from the lamb. The boyfriend quite enjoyed it but said it didn't hit the spot like he hoped.. . There were definitely other options I would've been keen on trying but the average pricing was $18 for all other types of burgers and I just don't care that much about burgers to spend close to $20. All comes with a small personal-sized bucket of fries or you could sub it for sweet potato fries or onion rings for an extra $2.. . The bill came out to be $70 after taxes and tip... that's pretty rough in my opinion but I guess I shouldn't expect any less from restaurants on the Strip. . . Would I come here again? Sure if my out-of-town friends dragged me. As for the shakes, I think they are definitely worth a try since some of the concoctions are pretty interesting and unique (not to mention it also includes liquor) if you don't mind spending the extra $13. As for me, a non-drinker, I'll just stick to off-strip joints for any burger cravings...
Really good food and great service. I wouldn't complain about the price because it is Vegas and they do offer quality ingredients. . . I'd stop by for a lunch or early dinner. Not a place you would get too dressy for but a great place to get a burger.. . I went back later for their alcoholic shakes ... Out of this world.
I Like Your Buns Hun. ***************************. . . This was quite a nice hidden gem at the Cosmopolitan that I have discovered.  In contrast to Gordon Ramsey's BurGr, this place is not as crowded.   I felt I had a lot of elbow space.  I sat at the counter, but there were nice comfy looking couches in the restaurant.  . . I ordered the "Holstein Beef Tiny Buns" with american cheese.  Basically 3 sliders.  I have had my share of sliders in the past, but these were well above average.  To paraphrase Harold and Kumar, " those itty-bitty grilled onions that just explode in your mouth like flavor crystals every time you bite into one."The fries were nothing special.  . . I see myself coming back to this place for a quick meal break after playing blackjack.
Not a bad spot to hit before the club.  I had the burger with Brisket, with an add on of gruyere and bacon.  The burger was cooked well, but it was a little bland on flavor.  The brisket needed a little kick of something.  The onion rings I had with my order had a really crispy batter.
I got the rising sun burger and it was BOMB. Teriyaki meat with avocado. It had a crunch with fried potato (?). The meat was a tad bit on the saltier side but overall the burger was one of the best burgers I have consumed. This place is quite expensive so expect to be spending aroun $20+ burger afer tips and tax. Nevertheless, it lived up to the hype.
This place is AWESOME!!! The portion is just right, free popcorn, burger is as good as the Gordon Ramsay one without 1 hour of waiting!! :)
Horrible service. We received our milk shakes melted after waiting 35 minutes for them. We also ordered fries but never received them and waited another 25 to get our check. Milk shakes we're okay but not great for the bad service.
We felt like burgers and happened upon Holsteins. The food is pretty good and the atmosphere is fun. My boyfriend had the golden ticket burger: goat cheddar, bacon, arugula, confit tomato and added a fried egg. He's a chef in LA and hard to please, but enjoyed it for the most part. He asked for medium rare and it came medium. But again, he's hard to please! I had the beef sliders add goat cheddar and it was delicious! We also tried the Cuban street tacos which were also very tasty. Lastly, we ordered the maple bacon shake with whiskey which was, again, tasty! Great service as well. We would go back to try the fois gras burger!
Both delicious and affordable! Its about $16-20 a plate (all the burgers come with fries as well). . . I got the Crazy Bird (I think that's what it was called) which was the chicken burger. It had candied shallots, garlic aioli, cheese, lettuce and kettle chips. I ended up scraping the candied shallots off because I didn't like them much but everything else was spot on! . . My favorite part, however, was the French fries. Absolutely delicious. They didn't taste like fake packaged potatoes you get at a lot of other places and the serving size was good! . . The service was good, I don't know our waitress' name but she was fast and attentive. . . Cons: . . The food took quite long to come out. But I will also mention that it was Saturday night, it didn't seem too busy to me but hey this could've been why. This was the main reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars. . . The shakes are overpriced. $9 for a basic shake. . . The popcorn they gave didn't really have a taste, but hey it was free so can't really complain there. . . Overall, good experience here. I would recommend this place when you don't want a big buffet but want a good meal. You'll leave here full for less than $20 if you don't add on any extras!
Excellent Char-broiled Burgers and Great Shakes. Loved the crunchy buttermilk onion rings. Sports bar too so fun affordable spot to hang and inhale the Testosterone!  ;-)
Looking for a fancy burger and shake place, with a mid-range price? This place is great, if you happen to be near the cosmopolitan. The regular or 'spiked' shakes are great, definitively filling. They fill your cup and you have half the shake mixing cup full with more. If you must try and have a small stomach-share one! Especially when you want to enjoy your burger. Al the burgers are good, depending what you have the taste for. For any pallet there is a burger for you.. . Atmosphere is nice, chill and casual. No need for "club" attire, so perfect for something while out on or after sightseeing. . . If you want to so more than just drink a shake or have a beer and actually want to eat, don't sit in the lounge area. The (coffee) tables are too low to properly eat a burger. If you don't want to eat stuff off your lap, then you should get a seat at the bar or the dining area. Otherwise there is nothing bad about this place.
Great Burgers.. I had the,. . Billionaire Burger. Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, Truffle Mayo.. . Was fantastic.. Try the Booze Shakes.. Also very Tasty.. . A must if in the mood for a great gourmet Burger.. . Would for sure eat here again.
Let me start of by saying this is probably one of the best burgers I've tasted so far! . Located at the Cosmopolitan hotel it was very easy for my boyfriend and I to walk downstairs to this place. The atmosphere was fun and lively. It had a bit of a kidish environment with all the painting of cartoonish cows on the wall (personally I think it was so cute and adorable). Friendly staffed. My boyfriend ordered the Funghi burger and I had the Rising Sun. I'm not a huge fan of truffle oil so I stuck with my Rising Sun which was a version of a teriyaki burger of some sort. Both were good. In the beginning of our meal they brought us some cheddar popcorn it was really good complimentary of course. Last but not least we had to order one of their famous milkshakes boozed it up Vegas style duh! . We had the Fat Boy. Haha it was pretty fatty. . Can't wait to go back next time!
Do not order anything else but the following: 1. Funghi Burger with egg! 2. Buffalo wings ... The rest is up to you but those two are a must!! The restaurant is chill, and you can never go wrong with some hamburger and good old american food right here in Marquee. Our waiter was amazing as well, he had some good suggestions and he was so kind when we told him we were not a fan of the bulgogi quesadilla which is pictured in my yelp review here. . . I don't recommend the bulgogi quesadilla!!! I just was not a fan.
Three words: BEST BURGERS EVER!!!. . . I had the steakhouse burger with a fried egg and it was deeeeelish!!! Everyone that had food enjoyed every morsel of their food :). . Lobster mac & cheese was amazing too!!. . Some guy came by and gave us liquid nitrogen frozen mints afterwards which was soooo cool!!!. . Edit: so we came back the today to have dinner AGAIN because it was so good yesterday. I had the "rising sun" burger with jalapenos (per recommendation of waiter Justin) and it was awesome. Considering the size of the burger, it was very light on your palate. The teriyaki sauce adds the perfect touch to the tempura avocado. . . Also, customer service is great. We had Justin as our server twice in a row and he totally remembered us, down to the drinks we ordered last night. . . Definitely stop by if you're in Vegas!!!
Two words... Gold Standard. Amazing burger! You will not leave hungry. The fries were great, HUGE selection of drinks. Try their adult milkshakes!
I usually don't like to eat on The Strip when I'm in Vegas, but I was tempted to check out this place. I loved the cow art all over the restaurant. Our waiter was very attentive and the service was amazing. Yes, these buglers are not cheep, and your bill will probably go up if you're drinking, but then again it's The Strip. . I had the Gold Standard, which was one of the best burgers ever. The meat was delicious and the goat cheese complimented the burger perfectly. My friend had the burger with pork rinds and oaxacan cheese, which was so good. It was my heavy at all it was actually perfect. I really wanna try their adult shakes next time. I'm there. Great beer selection also. They know their beers and burgers which is an A+ for me.
COOLEST PLACE. They had sick art work everywhere .  prices where kinda high. portions where gigantic .  or  (depending on how you take it) the location is hopping, loud, active and there's a night club next door.  AMAZING BURGER.  great service
10 stars!!!!! Hands down best burgers ever!  I came here two nights in a row because the food was so good. Rising Sun and Long Horn are best! Great flavor! It would be an insult to put ketchup or mustard on this burger.  Good food, good service, awesome place!!!!!! Come down immediately  !!!!!!
