haoamammmmmmmm I've been wanting to try BurGR ever since they opened and I was ecstatic to have a chance to this weekend!  The fire decor on the exterior of the restaurant is definitely eye catching!  Their seating service was convenient, in that we notified the the host, and they wrote down our number, giving us an ETA and a text of when our table would be available.  Skipping the line waiting was the best feeling ever!  Wasn't too hard to pass time as the surrounding area of Planet Hollywood is filled with shops and gambling!  . . When we were notified of seating, I was relived to be seated in a very "relaxing" environment. With no actual line queue for the restaurant, I feel that everyone was relived, and there was no rushed eating/squished dining quarters to accommodate demanding hungry diners!  Since my group ordered a lot of appetizers, we all split a burger between 2 people, which went perfectly!  . . Jalapeno poppers were great and fun, in that of the 6 served, 1 was extra spicy!  Truffle fries and sweet potato fries were also delicious accompaniments.  you definitely have to try the MILKSHAKES!! I believe it was #4, but there was creme brullee and cookies and cream.  It was a heavenly experience.  The handful of sips i stole off my cousin were amazing.    . . BURGERS ARE PERFECT YES.  They are cooked exactly how youd want them, whether it be med rare, med etc!! and you can tell they use good beef.  It was unlike any other burger I've ever had, nice and hearty mmm.  Next time I want to try the farm burger!  Pricing is very reasonable, ~15/16 per burger.  Compared to Umami Burger, Gordon Ramsay is completely worth it.  The burger sizes are larger, and the tastes are still amazing.
I'm a big Gordon Ramsay fan but BurGR fails to meet the high standards we've all grown so accustomed to seeing from him.. . We stopped by for a late lunch and were given a 30 minute wait for our table. Fair enough, however an hour later we still hadn't been seated and the front desk looked like a slow moving train wreck. There were about 4 different hostesses juggling 10-20 different groups of people and none of them seemed to be communicating with one another. When the manager stepped in we spoke to them and were promptly seated.. . Highlights: The quality of ingredients and presentation were very good. All of the food looked great. The burgers and fries were decently tasty but overall not worth the jumped up prices.. . Lowlights: Subpar service was the biggest disappointment. Our server was attentive at first but disappeared once our food was ordered. Each burger is made to order and you can specify the cooking temperature. All 4 of us ordered the same burger 'The American' but had different cooking preferences. They arrived with no markings as to which ones were cooked a certain way and we had to cut all of them in half to determine who's was who's. Ultimately it didn't matter as all of them were cooked well done. The only ketchup BurGR serves is made in house and is laced with a chipotle seasoning. If that isn't your thing, you won't be using any ketchup for your burger or fries.. . Try BurGR if you're a Ramsay fan or there's absolutely no wait. However the basic fare doesn't warrant the high prices.
Ah, that feeling of disappointment. . . All that elaborate fire display at the front entrance ... only if I can use that to heat up my cold burger ... . . For some reason, it took me more than half a hour JUST to locate this restaurant because I entered through the wrong entrance (south entrance of Miracle Mile Shops). The restaurant is located at the NORTH entrance (toward to Paris Las Vegas  direction) of Miracle Mile Shops. Make an immediate right turn (you should see Sephora on your right side), walk into Planet Hollywood (you'll see Starbucks on your left side), and the restaurant should be located on your right side. . . It was 5 PM on Friday and there was already a long line. Fortunately, we only had to wait for 30 minutes. Our waitress was very friendly and immediately took our orders.  . . Farm Burger (duck breast bacon + English sharp cheddar + fried egg -  $15 / $14 Total Rewards discount) - Cold and not-so-juicy patty ... sigh. Overall, it wasn't as flavorful asI thought. The only good part? Probably the sesame buns.   . . Truffle Parmesan Fries (hand cut fries + truffle parmesan + truffle salt + truffle aioli -  $11 / $10 Total Rewards discount) - Fries were more like potato wedges. What was the one common theme between fries and burger? You guess it, both were COLD (tasted like they had been sitting out for a long time). Fries tasted pretty average. However, garlic aioli dipping sauce tasted very delicious. . . Overpriced burger for average quality and doesn't worth 30 minutes ~ 60 minutes of wait. I will only come back here again ONLY IF there's no waiting line.
Visiting a Gordon Ramsey restaurant was to be a highlight of our Vegas trip for my teen, who enjoys his Master Chef shows.  We so wanted to like this restaurant...but it wasn't to be.  We thought the decor and iPad menus were neat, but the tight server uniforms rode up on the waitresses thighs to the point I worried we were going to see more than intended.  We started with the Truffle Fries, which were tough and tasted stale. Instead of being golden brown and crisp, they were pale and appeared to have been sitting a long time between frying.  When offered a replacement, we switched to the Maui Onion Rings and they truly were fabulous.  The worst part of the experience though was the burgers.  We ordered one Farm Burger and one Chanterelle Mushroom Burger, both well done.  Both came, sans any sauce, and severely under done...very pink inside. You would think a restaurant specializing in burgers is very experienced in cooking them to the customers desired done ness (otherwise why ask "how would you like that cooked?").  We sent those back as well, and told the waitress to not rush, we'd rather have them done than fast.  When our replacement burgers arrived, one was fine but the other was pink on one side.  When it was returned as well (with no offer of selecting a different entree), we were so disappointed.  My teen ate her Farm Burger and just as we were ready to request the check (and go find another option for lunch for me since I was now starving), the on duty manager approached and comp't our meal.  This was nice (and the right thing to do), but I would have greatly preferred to speak to him much earlier and actually eat something for lunch, so having him not appear until that point was actually the coffin nail that labeled our experience an "epic fail".
very pricey, but I guess that's to be expected from such an establishment. Everything tasted great, even the "just fries" but nothing justified its price. The "just fries" were way better than $1 fries from McD's, but not $8 good. The shakes (#2 and #3) were fantastic, but not $9 (each) fantastic. The burgers were amazing, and these were the only dish whose price (~$13-16) seemed reasonable. Prices met my expectations from someone like Ramsay, but the taste of the fries and shakes didn't really match their prices. Anyway, the food is good and the service is awesome, but the prices are sky high, and the only things that seem worth getting are the burgers.
I wanted to eat here for a while now, so decided to have this with the group on Saturday night. . . You have to stand in line, so they can get you a seat. I wish they had a better way of doing this cause it was so super hot staying next to the fire, also all those seats and slot machine just calling our names while in line. Eventually, when you get to the front of the line someone will ask how many in your party. We told her we were a party of 10. She let us out of line and ask for our phone number. She said she will call us when to come back since it was a big party. Once again, I don't know why they didn't do this at the beginning. Oh well! We ended up having to separate our party cause I guess it would be hard and long to get that many tables together since it looks like most table were made for only two people. . . On to the food: . Beer battered maui onion rings-these were okay. I'm a fan of onion rings but it wasn't something I wanted more and more of . . Truffle parmesan fries-I finally learn I'm not a big fan of truffle. Also, the fries were very very very salty. I think I would try the sweet potato or the just fries next time . . Hell's Kitchen Burger-I was in love with this burger. I ended up getting no bun and making it into a salad wrap. So, I bet if I had it on a bun I would even be more in love with it. This burger had every sense going when you bite into it. You have the spicy from the roasted jalapeno peppers, the coolness with the avocado, and the sweetness with oven roasted tomato. All together just made a wonderful bite of a burger. Yummy. . . Shake #2-this shake had coconut pudding, strawberry shake, and chocolate cookies. It was delish!!! Nice and creamy! Prefect. I think I had two sips and my hubby was already finish with it. It was that good. . . Overall, if you're craving for a burger and shake. This is the place for you! Good stuff.
Definitely an over-rated spot. The wait was an hour on a Saturday night.  Good thing we came early.  It took forever to get seated after the hour mark.  The service was really good in general.   . . I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and added a fried egg to it because I love fried eggs on my burger.  Was the burger good?  Yes, but not worth an hour wait or the average sticker price of $15 a burger.  For that price I actually prefer Red Robin (I know, how blasphemous but so true).  And that even comes with bottomless fries and the burgers are juicier.  The fries here were pretty good but not worth the high price tag.  I did try someone's Oreo shake and it was REALLY good.  That's probably worth ordering for sure.  . . I'm glad I tried this once but I probably won't come back again, nor recommend this place.  Not worth the wait or the price.
The lines are long to eat here at peak hours, and from the Hell's Kitchen-esque decor to the souvenir menu that you're encouraged to take home you never forget that you're eating at a tourist trap.. . The burgers themselves? They're okay. You can get as good of a burger at several upscale burger bars on the Strip, and I can think of several better burgers I could get at home. [Go to Houston. Find Bernie's Burger Bus. Thank me later.] They're expensive with fussy ingredients, they're on the dry side, and whatever they decided to top my Hog Burger with just didn't quite work. But we were on vacation and we didn't have to dress up, so I just smiled and watched football with my wife. It all worked out well in the end.
We came here during a weekday. No wait. I ordered the hell's kitchen burger and hubby had the blue burger with truffle Parmesan fries to share. Burgers came out in less than 10 minutes. Mine came with lots of avocado and jalapenos. It wasn't very spicy. It was perfect. His had a bit too much blue cheese for my taste but he loved it. We ordered both burgers medium well. Meat was juicy and tasty. Buns were soft and fluffy. Overall,  a really good experience. A great burger joint to try out if in the area.
Don't submit to the hype.. . It was an overrated (literally) restaurant. I had the Farm Burger and Truffle Parmesan Fries. The burger was overly dry and bland. The fries were bland as well. Please salt the fries!. . Go for the experience, but not the food. The burger at Guy Fieri at the Quad was a lot better.
Had lunch here with my wife and was very pleased. My burger was delicious and actually made the way i like it, "medium". Servers were all nice and enjoyed our time there.
MAKE RESERVATIONS FIRST. That's the best advice I can give. The food here is phenomenal, the staff is very educated on the menu and delivers exceptional service and the food is absolutely amazing. You can make reservations and then wander around Planet Hollywood for a bit, then walk back up and get a table. Once you're inside, the service doesn't take too long at all, it's just a matter of getting a table. I will definitely go back here next time I'm in Vegas. Make sure to try the fries for sure!
Very delicious. ..the burger was cooked perfectly and the meat was top notch.  Roll was light and fresh. Service was amazing. ...drinks and waters always full and Dorota was a great server...shout out to her! If you are looking to take a load off....have a diverse tap beer menu and a truly delicious burger......BurGR is a must stop. PS reasonable prices on beer and burgers!!!!!!
The burgers are great, but is worth the wait? Depends how much you want to eat at Gordon Ramsay restaurant, because there are plenty of just as good burgers around the strip without a wait. . . The chicken wings were honestly the best thing we had with this meal, simply perfect. The burgers were all nice and very tasty, cooked perfectly. The fries were good as well. I also ordered a milk shake, I forget which one, but I think it was something with banana. It was alright, extremely rich and thick, not for the faint of heart. . . Good, but pass on it unless you're willing to wait for it.
Gordon really knows his burgers.  I have been here twice in the last 6 weeks.  We loved our first experience so much we had to stop again on our way through Las Vegas.  My only complaint the second time was my own fault.  For some reason I went with Med Well which I almost never do and it was more like well.  Super dry and definitely took away from the meal.  The first time I did order it medium and it was great!!!  The quality of products that Gordon uses is top of the line.  From the Parmesan just bursting with fruity flavor on top of the Truffle Fries, the interesting dipping sauces that come with every App and Fry side, to the attention to detail in the marinade of the mushrooms on the Chanterelle Burger.  The first time around I had the Farm Burger due to a suggestion by a You Tube Fav of mine Jack on The Go.  He and his crew said the Farm Burger was the best burger of all time.  Seeing this I just had to try it.  I didn't myself love the Farm Burger cuz I don't love breakfast.  It kinda tasted like breakfast on a burger.  With that being said, it tasted like the best breakfast of bacon and eggs you've ever had on one of the best burgers you've ever had.  Like I said I'm not a huge fan of Breakfast and since I already had bacon and eggs that morning it was a bit of a disappointment for me.  Not because the flavor wasn't there but, more so it's just not what I was expecting.  The bacon itself was to die for, a duck breast bacon.  The egg was a little more cooked than I would of liked since I like it to run over the burger when you bite in but the quality in the egg was there.  We also tried the Sweet Potato Fries our first time.  Dusted in Vanilla powdered sugar and coming with interesting dipping sauces they were great!  Second time around we tried the Truffle Fries, homemade ketchup and what I thought was a garlic aioli.  The mushrooms on the Chanterelle Burger were marinated in some kind of rosemary something and they were just divine!  The Jalapeno Poppers were another App tried the first time around and they were great!  I unfortunately got the one they joke you with that is stuffed with all the seeds.  Couldn't taste much after the heat in the one but, their presentation and flavor of the ranch they were dipped in was amazing!  We had amazing service both times and even got a chance to get a glimpse of one of the hot dogs on the menu at the table next to us and it looked great!  Don't let the line scare you they move through it quickly and the whole vibe of the restaurant moves quickly without creating a frantic environment for the diners.  I just love everything about this place and would recommend it to anyone.  Next time I stop through I'm going for the Euro Burger.  mmmmmm Goat Cheese!
Anytime I have friends come to las Vegas I bring them here to GR BurGR.  The burgers here are top notch, and I'd say I can't think of a better burger in Vegas.  . . The burgers are made from chopped up ribeye, so feel free to order the burger rare.  The truffle fries are superb as well, and one order is more than enough for 2 people.  The prices may seem a bit high, 13-18 for a burger, and 8-14 for apps and sides, but the quality and taste of the food definitely is in line with the prices.  . . There is a consistent line here, so be prepared for a little bit of a wait unless you're a Platinum or above member of Total Rewards.. . In short, if you've never been here, you definitely have to give it a shot.
Really great burgers. I had the Farm Burger  and I loved it. I came with 3 other people and we all loved it. The onion rings were fantastic too. We also had the Oreo shake, it was great.
The burgers are tasty but not worth the wait. Fries portion is too much and they couldn't do a half of order for me. It was frustrating. The burger was a little cold.
My long anticipate restaurant to try out. We were there early, around 6:30pm ... waiting line wasn't bad. We walked up to the counter and give them our phone number, they will text you when table is ready. We hang out in the casino for about 50mins, finally got the text! Yeah!!. . The food!! We ordered Truffle Parmesan Fries - thick cut fries with nice touch truffle oil, it comes with Special Ketchup and Aioli Sauce. Fell in love with the Aioli Sauce, so good!. . Hubby's favorite Beer Battered Maui Onion Ring with Chipotle Ketchup and Cheddar Ranch Dips. It was super light and crispy, my friend said he can taste the beer!. . Hell's Kitchen Burger medium rare with lovely roasted tomato and spicy jalapeno peppers, prefect balance with cool creamy avocado! The beef was perfect medium rare!. . My friend ordered Southern Yardbird Burger - per my friend, it was the most tender juicy chicken burger he even tasted. It was indeed very tender!. . Finally, I wanted to try something other than burger, so I ordered something I really miss since I came back from London. . Fish & Crisp Sandwich - it was a huge piece of fish served in between thick Texas Toast, topped with thin crisp with salted and vinegar. The fish was perfectly fried, light and crispy, steamy and flaky fish!. . I definitely wanted to go back!
Is the best burger around? Not really. I'm a die-hard burger fan. Loved the fries, they serve beer and I was able to eat outside and read a book. The staff isn't overwhelming, just the right amount of attention. The burger? I ordered the basic principal. I enjoyed it and will be back. Cheap? No. But the place is nice and did I mention they serve beer. I was quite content to chow down on my burger with good Sam Adams.
You can find a better burger but you can't pay more for it.  $40 for a burger, fries and shake!
I have become kind of a lazy yelper lately but really wanted to write about Burgr because I was really impressed. We went at 6 on a Monday, waited about 15 minutes in line and were quickly seated. My husband and I shared the Hells Kitchen burger, poppers and onion rings. We were being healthy. ;). Everything was perfectly cooked. The poppers had a hint of bacon, which I knew about but probably wouldn't be my first choice. They were not overly spicy, and again, perfectly crispy and not tok greasy. Onion rings were amazing and burger was delish. I got one really spicy jalapeno which really burned, but that's to be expected. . . What really blew me away was the service. My water and beverage glass was never empty, my husband would order a beer and it would arrive two minutes later, the plates were quickly cleared, all in an unobtrusive way. I never felt rushed and we were really taken care of. Also, I think the prices were really reasonable. Great choice for a casual choice if you don't have a reservation.
I was surprised that there were no grass fed beef options on the menu. The fries (both regular and truffle Parmesan) were good and our server was super friendly and knowledgable about gluten sensitivities.
I loved it here! This is more than just a regular burger place (and the pricing reflects that.) I had the Farm Burger which has duck bacon on a steak burger and a fried egg. It was cooked to perfection and delicious. And what is a burger without fries? I ordered the truffle, garlic and parmesan version. It was very large, (enough for two), not too overwhelming truffle flavor. And then the shake, creme brulee oreo. It was the highlight! Awesome!. Burger, fry and shake? $45.11 Wow, but this is high end even for Vegas. Worth trying and even worth sharing. Ill be back!
Great food and welcoming service even with our HUGE group.. . Drinks were always coming and the food, though took a long time, was perfect!  The parm truffle fries are amazing!!. . 2nd time there and will deff return again.
Went for lunch early on a Tuesday - no line and I ate at the bar.. . Britannia burger was very good.  When you order a burger, that's all you get.  If you want a side, you can order fries.  I got the parmesan truffle fries.  The burger may have been good, but the fries were excellent.  They came with two kinds of dipping sauce.. . Burger, fries and two drafts - $43.00.  About averarage for that part of town.  Friendly staff.  I couldn't finish it all.  . . Overall, I'd give the place a thumbs up.. . BTW I saw quite a few people order the farm burger (it has an egg on it).  Looked good- I'll try that next time.
Farm burger was sooo tasty egg medium over easy and medium for the meat. Milk shake #5 was really tasty and the hummus was good too. Ughh. #foodcoma
Value for cost was decent. Seats and tables were strangely low. You won't rub elbows with chefs...but coupon mavens. I had the Gordon. In my opinion, they should have switched out the burger patty for the fancy ham. Instead, they topped it. Sort of busted and jenky. No regrets.
Came by to try the burgers at Planet Hollywood Hotel after watching KA at MGM. Not sure if it was worth the trip to be honest. Burgers were not as tasty as I had expected, perhaps my expectations were too high. Perhaps it was the choice of burger too, had the American burger - was nothing to shout about, kinda tastes like the super duper burger I had a couple of weeks back. Maybe I'll come back to try the other burgers if I'm in the area.
Average and decent burger at best. I was expecting more from a Gordon Ramsay joint but it was sadly uninspiring. I guess that's what happens when a chef expands his reach and turns an art into a pure business. Service was mediocre. Asked for a set of cutlery and the waiter forgot. Asked for extra bacon for my burger and either the kitchen forgot or the waiter did not write it down. I wouldn't recommend this.
Burger is good.  Not great.  Had the hells kitchen burger.  Not a bad burger.  Fries are large cut fries.  Good.  The oreo shake was fantastic.  Why just a 3 star?  When you pay over 13 bucks for a burger...  it should be better than you average burger.  Staff was helpful and bartender/server was fantastic.
Definitely not disappointed! I ordered a Hell's Kitchen burger and my boyfriend ordered the Euro burger. Perks of being in a relationship is I get to try more dishes of food! The Hell's Kitchen burger was not as spicy as i thought it would be and had hoped for, but it was definitely flavorful. The euro burger was rich and tasty. Both were delicious and paired nicely with the Innis and Gunn beer. This beer was smooth and has a subtle hint of whisky  definitely worth a try! Price is a little high for what it is, but then again, we are on the strip.
Average and decent burger at best. You can easily find any other place that serves burgers of this quality. Patty was dry and bland. Toppings for the burgers were boring and uninspiring. I was expecting more from a Gordon Ramsay joint but this was really quite disappointing. Service was mediocre. Asked for a new set of cutlery and the waiter forgot. Asked for bacon with my burger and either the waiter forgot to write it down or he kitchen overlooked. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
Food was good. Burger was supposed to be medium but it was medium well. Service lacked a bit.
Okay so it's date night and the GF and I decide to try out Gordon Ramsay's Burger spot in Planet Hollywood. As much as I disdain PH as a property, my experience with BurGR was actually pretty good! We arrived right around 5:00 pm on a Friday.. . SERVICE -. . We arrived early enough that there wasn't a wait. Hostess was friendly and prompt. The restaurant was quite full, mostly of people visiting the valley I suppose. The wait staff and support were attentive and responsive to assorted requests (like paper napkins). Drink order was taken immediately and our water glasses were never empty.. . FOOD -. . BurGR is a premium burger place. While I think "premium" and "burger" are somewhat conflicting, this establishment makes a solid effort todeliver a casual+ experience.. . We opened with some apps; the Bao Buns, Fury Chicken Wings and a Chili Dog. The disappointment in this group the obvious one. Bao Buns ?!?!? At a burger place??? What was EVERY on my mind??? Definitely out of place on the menu and on the taste buds! The wings and the dog, however, are worth the order. Both were flavorful and well prepared.. . We both had burgers, obviously, and they were really well prepared. Buns were toasted and soft, not too dry or stale. Beef was cooked to order and prepared perfectly; A+ here.. . We ordered the truffle fries as a compliment. The fries were great, but give a thought to the dipping sauces as some of the combinations get a little funky. All and all very satisfied with the meal.. *small disappointment on dessert choices, only shakes are available*. . ATMOSPHERE - . . This is a premium casual restaurant and, for me at least, I don't like seeing shorts, flip flops, baseball caps, and tank tops in the dining room after 5:00 pm. Granted, this is an establishment on the strip, but if that's your crowd move your price point to $7-$8 for a burger, not $13-$25.. . The place is active and loud, so it's more suited for a group to meet before an evening out on the town or to precede an active date night. Energy is UP!. . Last thing, be aware that the seating is unusually short/closer to the ground, than most places. I'm 6'2" and it felt like my knees were practically in my chest. Not horrible, but ...unusual. . . All and all, I invested $148+ tip and had an "ok" evening. I would go back with friends from out of town and maybe sit at the bar on the next trip.
All I have to say is. . Freshly made ketchup with the Parmesan fries. . Euro Burger was ridiculously good.. . I have to shout out the Ketchup again.
One of the best burgers I've had in a while.  Burgers are huge.  Their shakes are like a meal on its own.  I would recommend getting the shakes after your meal or else you'll be too full to enjoy the burger.
I love this place! I have been there at least 8 times and the food is simple and great. . I love the burgers but the deserts are my favorites... Yummy... Sticky toffee pudding and the hazelnut/coffee shake is to die for - got to try it.. Jalapeno poppers are all time favorite.. . I gave them 4 stars bc they are not consistent and their fries sucks :( . I order the sweet potato fires instead of the dry tasteless fires.
I cant give it a 5. The buns were too big and no flavor. I got the farm burger it was good but not amazing. We also had trouble flagging down a server to get some ketchup. The service was a bit nuts as in bad. The truffle fries were very good and iced tea fresh.
Delicious, awesome customer service! The burgers were awesome,  desserts scrumptious ... Gordon Ramsey is a genuis!
So disappointing! . . My friends and I were all looking forward to eating here before seeing a show. One of my gals had already been here once before and said it was very good so we had pretty high expectations. Plus, I love Gordon Ramsay and watch everything and anything that he has done on television. . . Luckily, we didn't have to wait for a table because I had a platinum total rewards card. The line was reeeeeally long and to be honest, if we did have to wait I would have been pissed.. . Our waitress seemed nice but it was impossible to hear her even though the restaurant wasn't very loud. Throughout our meal she was replaced by several different staff members so it got somewhat confusing. Different people would bring out our food and then other people would get our drinks which made it feel like a disorganized mess. . . Food was ok but totally not worth the hype or price tag. . . Onions rings - good crunch but very greasy. Jalapeno poppers - probably the best thing we had, but I'm pretty sure they forgot our "fiery surprise". French fries - decent, but could have used more salt and longer cook time. . I had the American burger because I was not feeling very adventurous and I figured it would be the hardest one to screw up. . . The bun was good but the burger overall was totally bland. While the cook on the burger was good, the meat did not seem seasoned enough at all. Additionally, there is no condiment on this burger which made for a completely flavorless experience. No fancy ketchup, no "secret sauce" aioli, not even a basic mustard. Nothing! You'd think they would want to put something like that on an "American burger"..? Or maybe that's just me.. While I liked that they used sweet pickles instead of dill, that was about the most stand out thing for me. . . My husband felt the same way about his bleu cheese burger. Not enough flavor and just overall extremely unimpressive from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. . . We also got the sticky toffee pudding push up pops which were, in short, disgusting. . The cake was extremely dry and crumbly with a flavor reminiscent of burnt molasses rather than nice toffee. The salted peanut ice cream was decent but seemed completely out of place with the other flavor. For me, the two did not meld well at all. I didn't finish mine. . . I'm not sure how this place consistently gets lines over 10 people deep, but I definitely won't be back. Super Meh. . . I'd sooner return to Stripburger (or even Carl's Jr. for that matter...sorry GR!)
So after trying Guy Fieri we HAD to try out Gordon Ramsay on our last day in Vegas.... . This was a really tough choice between the two! Everything was amazing! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger. This comes with avocado, cheese, jalapeno peppers. The burger was just right! To drink I got the skinny screw. It was delicious! You have to get it! They don't have their drinks on a menu. The waiter came with an ipad and pulled up their drinks for us to look at. & if I remember correctly they had 32 different beers to choose from! We also ordered the beer battered onion rings. OMG! They were some of the best onion rings I ever had. They came with a ranch dipping sauce that was so good I wanted to take some home with me! . . This was a really tough one for me. Between Guy Fieri and Gordon Ramsay they both had different things that I really enjoyed. I liked my burger at Guy Fieri better and the fact that it came with a variety of fries for no extra charge. However, I loved my drink and onion rings here at Gordon Ramsay. Both very pricey but well worth it. I'll definitely be back to try more items on the menu next time I'm in vegas!
My favorite burger place of all!! Really good especially the raspberry drink. The fries are even better. Very full after finished all the fries. They have unlimited refill for raspberry tea
My dad is obsessed with burgers and demanded that we eat at BurGR instead of Mon Ami Gabi; I'm not still not convinced that this was a good choice. My mother and I split the kale Caesar salad, which was my favorite part of the meal.  The dressing wasn't overly heavy and the apple complimented the bitterness of the kale, making it surprisingly palatable.  Even if you find kale to be the worst vegetable in the universe, which my mom and I do, you will probably enjoy this salad.  My dad and I had the farm burger, which my dad loved; I, however, did not.  The duck bacon that they put on top of the burger had a stringy consistency which made it hard to eat and activated my gag reflex.  The egg yolk had dripped all over my plate even before it made it to the table, making the bottom of an otherwise delightful bun soggy.  The burger itself was well-cooked, juicy, and flavorful.  All this combined made for an average burger.  My mom skipped the burger and ordered fish and chips instead.  I don't understand why it is served in giant sandwich roll which makes it impossible to eat unless you can unhinge your jaw.  She also said that the fish was bland and drenched it in ketchup to give it flavor.. The service was good and the waitress was attentive however, she gave us the wrong drinks and then forgot to bring us water with lemon in it. . Overall, this was a disappointing experience and I won't be coming back anytime soon.
We usually try to avoid these celebrity chef eateries, but we both really wanted a burger and decided to stop in while in Vegas for a couple of days. It's hard to tell WTF Planet Hollywood is - is it a mall? A hotel? A casino? Weird, since I think of it as a TGI Friday's with a Hollywood theme, but whatever. I'm sure a name and concept change is coming in the not-so-distant future. So, the burgers - were awesome!!! I had the American (I know, I know - boring!!!) and my fiance had the Farm (egg, duck bacon - he was instantly in love). Onion rings were amazing. The drinks are listed on an iPad. Totally impersonal and ridiculous - the one our waiter had took a dump while he was trying to show it to us, and he awkwardly scurried away to get us a new one. I hate those things, I hope they go out of style ASAP. I would definitely go back for more of those rings and one of those tasty sounding shakes!
The wings and jalapeno poppers are very good. I love the sauce the jalapeno poppers come with. It's like a tangy ranch like saucy. I can't really distinguish what it is actually. . If you have a total rewards card you save about $1 per item, which adds up to a nice savings. The service is fast for appetizers it is the burgers they make you wait on.
You don't have to wait in line if you're a platinum member!  The whole Menu is  cheaper if you are A platinum total rewards member (: The chicken burger is to die for the fries are also really good ! The burgers look small nut they are filing
We were there 11:30pm on a Saturday night, it's not that busy, so we were sit right away. The waitress is super friendly. They use an iPad and leaves it on the table for us to select our cocktails. We ordered onion rings, fries, the 5 spice chicken slider, the hell kitchen's burger which was super spicy for me, but it's so delicious! Yum.
Finally had time to do a review on this place!! Let's talk about location, it was inside Planet Hollywood's casino floor right along the strip. Decor and ambience was really nice. The whole place seemed a lot like what we watched on television of Hell's Kitchen. The sign, "BURGR GORDON RAMSEY," was made of glass with the inside lit with real fire. It was a sight to see! . . My bf and I decided to eat here on the second day we arrived in Vegas which was smacked on a Friday. Everywhere was packed with people going to eat, shopping and nightclubs. The restaurant was a full house but the wait wasn't long. There were two options for the waiting: one was to put your name on an iPad and put down how big or small is your party and they will call you when the table is ready or you can wait in the line which wasn't bad because we waited for about 15 minutes and we got seated. . . Upon being seated and looking at the menu (which is quite small and gets to the point of what burger was most recommended, it was really easy to choose). My bf got the Hell's Kitchen Burger while I got the Farm Burger. We also got the Truffle Parmesan Fries. Fries do not come with the burgers. Waiting for the food took roughly 30-45 minutes but my bf said it was worth it and he never says anything is worth it until this place. He devoured his burger and are almost all the fries and said it was great. He loved this place and would want to visit again. I thought my burger can do a little veggie in it but regardless it's a great burger for meat lovers.
This place is the bomb dot com. My husband and I came here after hitting up bacchanal buffet so we were pretty full. But I made it a mission to try this place mainly because I love watching him on food network and the show with the little kids chefs. So we came here to split a burger, I think it was called hells burger. My goodness it was juicy and flavorful. And by flavorful I mean you taste every single ingredient in the burger. One bite and you taste the tender juicy meat, the avocado which cools down the spice and adds a creamy texture, the chili spice factor of the pepper, earthiness of the greens, the smell in the perfection of the bread buns, and whatever sauce they put in the burger. Maybe it's pregnancy hormones but this is the best burger I've ever had in my life. My husband also ordered a shake which had cream brulee and Oreo. Weird mix but the best shake I've ever had in my life. I love all ice cream shakes in the world but this shake is so good it makes me want to cry craving it right now. Humm... Is it too evil to make my husband fly to Vegas with me for a burger meal right now. Anyways I definitely recommend this place, it has to be a mandatory life bucket list sorta thing.
This is our favorite place to eat in Las Vegas! Burgers shakes and sweet potato fries are all great! We stop there every time we passed through, we recommend it to anyone.
This place is obviously a big tourist attraction, and it works. The blue burger and "just" fries I got were nothing short of excellent! Service was good, too. We got lucky and did not have to wait in line to get inside, since we went on a Wednesday night.. . One nice touch that was unique was that when you get the bill at the end, there is an iPhone inside asking you to complete a survey based on your experience. Somebody must have money if he can put an iPhone inside every bill holder!. . The only thing I don't like about this place is that it is too loud inside. It's one of those restaurants where the music is played so loud that it's hard to hear your server or even have a conversation for that matter. However, I let them know about that in the survey, so at least they seem to care about customer feedback.. . I would gladly come back to try another burger. Gordon Ramsay did well here.
Food was very good. The menu is well thought out and executed, and I recommend items be ordered as they are presented on the menu - no real changes necessary. . . Service was VERY bad. I was shocked. We sat at the bar. There are now plenty of burger places in Vegas, no reason to pay a premium price and deal with sub-par service. Groups of hosts, and servers chatting in corners. Nonchalant service. lackadaisical approach to management. I can go into detail - but I'll save that. . . You'll enjoy your meal - but I honestly expected MUCH better service and a better eye to detail from the management team (it starts at the top).
Tammy the waitress was amazing . Make sure u ask for her. Food was also really good!!!
Great ambiance! Loved the decor and setting. Food was very good. The ala carte prices, for sides, were way too high ($8 for a small fry and $4 for a soda). Burgers were good. My daughter had the hot dog (no kids menu so they rip you off by making your little one order a full meal). . Overall... Loved it. This was our second time here.
What an amazing burger place and not too bad of prices either to eat at a Gordan restaurant. My husband and I shared the Euro burger and Truffle fries. Delicious. The burger came with a roasted tomato and goat cheese on it. Perfection! The truffle oil and Parmesan were not just sprinkled on top of the fries, but throughout which made them superb. The staff was friendly and on point. Make sure to save room for dessert because the shakes are sinful. All are topped with pudding and a cookie, which sounds a bit different but it works. We got the chocolate shake topped with caramel pudding and a toffee cookie. The best chocolate shake I've ever gotten. Just the right amount of cocoa and sweetness.
Oversalted overpriced garbage.. I ordered the Farm burger. The duck bacon tasted like a salt-lick. The burger, itself, had almost no flavor. It was a good-sized patty, though. I asked for roasted jalapenos. For a SLIVER of jalapeno I got charged $3.00 and of course the waiter didn't even bother to mention that I'd be getting reamed, but hey it's Vegas. My wife ordered the Hell's Kitchen. It was also bland and the mushy tomatoes were disgusting and didn't complement the burger at all. . . The fries were decent, skin on and thick. One order was more than enough for two people. The fries are the reason BOOGR isn't getting one star. I would've preferred plain ketchup to the over spiced curry and chipotle travesties that came with the fries. They had regular ketchup but, again, it was super salty. It appears the only flavor Gordon Ramsey understands is salt.. . Service: There are signs telling you to check with the hostess before getting into line, so I asked the surly bimbo up front and she simply told me to go stand in line. What was I supposed to check-in for?. . There's a local place in Pasadena, CA that has almost the same burger but does it SO much better. Someone should scream at Ramsey for this trainwreck of a burger place.
I don't really know what to say, except this is the best burger I've ever had in my life. The patty was juicy and well cooked, and the combination of tastes complemented everything perfectly. It really was as good as a burger can get. Just watch out though, the Hell's Kitchen's burger can get SPICY. The chanterelle mushroom burger, which my gf got, was also delicious. The parmesan truffle fries were tasty as well, and matched the burger well. The line can get long, but if you only have two people, they guarantee 20 minute or less wait if you stand in line. I waited about 4 minutes. Seriously consider making this place a staple of my vegas trips in the future.
If you love burgers, skip this place. This place has great appetizers and shakes. Not so much the burgers..... . We are so disappointed by the experience we had. My euro burger was average. My fiance's burger came completely well done even though we ordered medium. The meat was stiff and there's no pink whatsoever. . . If this is just another burger joint, we wouldn't complain. But this is Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. He's very strict about how food should be. How in the world do you make this noob mistake? Plus, the server didn't even give us any discounts or anything. She just made us wait an extra ten minutes for a new burger which was cut in half. Not worth the premium.. . This is a heavy blow to his reputation.
Chanterelle Burger. That's all you need to know when you're going there. That burger by itself will get a good 5 stars rating. The fries, onion rings, salads, the service and the horrible waiting time and the high price are pushing the experience down towards the 2-3 stars area, but that wonderful burger saves the day. A classic 4 star
Food was pretty good aside from the fact that they ignored our food allergy requests. Had two people allergic to peanuts at our table - I ordered a salad that came with peanut dressing, and told them we had allergies at our table and asked them to substitute a different dressing. Instead they brought the salad covered in peanuts, and the peanut dressing. Accidentally tasted the dressing thinking it was the substitute dressing I had asked for - Other places in Vegas were so considerate and even printed 'peanut allergy' on our ticket to alert the kitchen of a severe allergy. This place acted like they had never seen a peanut allergy.
"OvR" Rated. ****************. . . . After rolling out of bed at 2 PM during my Vegas weekend, I felt like getting a  greasy burger to counter my hangover.  I am always skeptical about hyped up burgers from famous chefs.  Quite honestly, I chose this place because it was easy walking distance.  We bypassed the line and sat at the counter.  . . . The decor and service were pretty good.  . I ordered the  "Hell's Kitchen burger," one of their more popular burgers.  It was good, but just OK.   Truffle Parmesan fries were pretty good.  . . Good thing I came at the hour I did, because there was a sizable line forming.  . . Overall, I would not come back again.  If you are interested in a tasty burger without the waiting,   I actually recommend Holsteins at the Cosmopolitan.  Its a hidden gem.  Delicious
I love this place! The food was aaamazing! I had the devil dawg and it was very everything I hoped it would be. Delicious!
BurGR definitely lives up to the hype. The burgers were top notch. When we went the wait for the food was a little long and our waitress, while not out right rude, did not seem to enjoy being there and didn't seem to have much patience. . . I was skeptical of the truffle aioli, but it was in fact delicious. I definitely suggest this restaurant to everyone and don't be scared of the aoili. :)
This place is great! Love the ambiance from both inside and out of the restaurant. We will the had cut fries that came with Chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup. The curry ketchup was out of this world delicious. Our burgers were so flavorful and cooked perfectly. I had the butterscotch pudding and banana shake. O-M-G, this was life changing. I haven't stopped thinking about it since we left Vegas. Come here. It's worth the wait.
Food was good no doubt. . Service needs some major adjustments...the wait in line to be seated took about 45 minutes, after beinging seated it took about 15 minutes for waitress to take our order. The food took about another 30 minutes.. Even though the food was good the wait time leaves a regretful taste not soon forgotten
This is not the first time I been to this place. If you are successfully get a table and get served with food. You will probably ratea 5 stars for their food. For my experience I waited 20 mins in the line and got seated at the bar. (SERIOUSLY DONT TAKE THE BAR) we ended up waiting for 1 hour and leave without any food!!!! We have talked to the server and he doesn't seem to be helpful whatsoever.
I'm a major Gordon Ramsay fangirl...and one of my life's ultimate goals is to try EVERY possible Gordon Ramsay restaurant on the PLANET--and Mars if we were happen to get there and GR opens a restaurant there.. . Anyways, I've been to Las Vegas a fair share of times and I've always wanted to try BurGR...and I had my lucky chance finally last spring. Generally the wait is RIDICULOUS come lunch time if you don't have a reservation...so if you want to come for lunch, make sure you call in for a reservation beforehand!. . My friends and I came here a little bit after they opened in the late morning, so we didn't have to wait too long for a table. We ordered:. . (1) Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings . (2) Honey-Pig Bao Buns . (3) Farm Burger. (4) Southern Yardbird Burger. . Now, the onion rings were off the hook delicious! The Bao Buns were like mini-pork steam buns (for you food truck lovers in SF, they're similar to Chairman Bao's steamed pork buns). The farm burger had that gorgeous fried egg with the oozing yolk (YUM). The Yardbird was eh.. . Now, this is Las Vegas and it's a GR restaurant...so don' expect this place to be cheap. Each burger is about $12-16. While the burgers weren't "blow your mind you have to try this every time you come to Vegas" quality, it was still very tasty. . . The layout of the restaurant opens up to the casino area of Planet Hollywood, which is nice...and it's far enough from the casino that you're not entirely experiencing second smoking while you eat.. . The only gripe I had about this place was theSERVICE. The service was TERRIBLE here...and I was really surprised given that this was a GR restaurant...and efficient and impeccable service is what GR prides himself in. I remember that our waiter forgot our order multiple times....and would disappear for a long time after we had asked him to check on our food. We probably spent about 45 minutes to an hour just waiting for our food...and we had to ask about 4-5 times about our food. Had the service been much better, I would have given this place a solid 4-star.
Burgers are above average. Truffle fries are delicious and large enough to share. The second time here, I ordered the Damnation chicken burger but it wasn't spicy at all. If you come here and don't get a shake, you are dumb. Hands down, best shakes I have ever had.
What can i say food amazing and service amazing as well honestly best burger I've had. Farm burger is the top one i recommend the pork bao buns delicious as well gordon Ramsey is doing it well
A little overrated. The menu looks and sounds great but the food wasn't great. I ordered the fish and crisps. The fish didn't have the right seasoning and seemed bland. The sweet potato fries had powdered sugar which I didn't like. I also tried the Hell's Kitchen burger which was HOT!! My mouth was on fire!! . . The service was great, the food came out quickly, and the prices were a little above average (then again, Vegas has overpriced food everywhere). I probably won't go back to this restaurant since I didn't love it.
OK I am a HUGE fan of Gordon R and his shows...so when in Vegas we went to BurgGR and had a much anticipated burger. I had the Farm BurGR, I think as there really was nothing memorable about it. The seasoning seemed non existent the truffle fries... so what- my local Pub buried this place in taste and value (fair enough I certainly did expect to pay more here, but I also expected a bit more than a large fire). Still a Gordon Ramsey fan but I will think twice about celebrity eateries before entering so that I could say I ate there...next time I may lie and say I did and live in blissful ignorance. I guess the reality of it all is how much better can a person make a hamburger? . Any recommendations for my next  trip?
Normally I don't write a review but I thought I should share my experience here.... . First of all we waited approximately 40 minutes to get our food. That is ridiculous.. Second the burgers were not cooked as we requested. We requested medium rare to the rare side but what we received was medium well to well done side. . Third I ordered the honey pig bao buns, which taste really good and I do recommend this but one of the buns had piece if a hair inside. The restaurant did change the item with new one and the manager person came by to apologize and removed it off my tap. That I really appreciate because not that many places have manager to come out to apologize.. Fourth we ordered the truffle fries and they forgotto bring the truffle aioli sauce.. . Now about the food. . The burgers my group ordered was ok... Not as great as we expected. . The truffle fries seemed no difference with regular fries. . The onion ring was the best!!!! I would be rating with a single star but for the taste of onion ring  and the honey pig bao buns I added another star.    . . Next time if I come here I probably prefer not to sit at the table but instead sit at the bar and order my onion ring and the honey pig bao buns!!!
Cool place. I liked their jalapeno cheese appetizer. I would recommend it for starters.
Pros: I had a very good experience with their food. We ordered two burgers, Jalapeno poppers and the Bao buns. . Cons: cold waiters + price ( 95$ including tip +two beers)
OMG, the food here was heaven! . Just drooling thinking about his other restaurants when just his burger and fries alone are 5 stars!. . This is a must go place!. Burger was so delicious. . Hearty, flavorful, and juicy.. Truffle fries were plump, garlicy, and cheesy.. Just the way I like it!. . Would definitely go back here in a heartbeat =D. (Oh but one drawback was that the napkins smelt like dirty rags... should use better cleaning method)
really long line for burgur, but its pretty damn good!!. . dined in, had the farm burger truffle fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, toffee pops. . all good!! a little pricey but i really enjoyed it. . service was great as well, ordered to go a second time late at night near closing time to eat in my room as the line was still long got my food pretty quick!
My wife and I ate here two hours ago and it was everything we hoped it would be. We waited in line for 30 minutes, and were seated and approached by our waiter who was very friendly. We shared a Parmesan fries which was absolutely out of this world. She had the "earth" burger and a chocolate shake with caramel pudding in it. I had the chanterelle burger with an Oreo Shake with creme brulee pudding in it. One of the best burgers we've ever had.
a bit pricy but really good and the queue to get to get in isn't that bad
I'm only giving this place 2 stars due to the service was good. The food was over rated over priced and I would not recommend this place to anyone. Had to wait over an hour with hungry kids. We ordered the onion rings which were great and the sweet potato fries were good. The truffle ff were horrible. They do not offer a kids menu so had to pay full price for something the kids would not finish and for that it is not a kid friendly restaurant.  The burgers were okay nothing out of the ordinary.  I think in n out or shake shack would have been a better choice and more reasonable priced.
how do you ruin a good quality burger?  fail to season the meat properly prior to cooking.  GR, I know you've heard of salt and pepper.  like most other strip restaurants, BurGR suffers from the inexplicable need to play down to the blandest of palates.
Amazing burgers. . . Every time I go to LV I have to stop here. Gordon Ramsay, you have a way with burgers that's for sure!!! The menu is simple, to the point, and offers a selection of specialty burgers that are also simple, but amazing. The way he pairs such easy ingredients to become amazing burger toppings is ridiculous. I would recommend trying the mango chutney and arugula burger.. . As well as this, they also have PUDDING MILKSHAKES. Yes you heard me right. They're amazing. I honestly want one right now.. . You can see into the kitchen the meticulous process that goes into making the burgers. There is even a taste tester at the end of the line, and if the burger isn't perfect, it's not sent out. But somehow, the time doesn't drag on because of this. But watching the cooks you can see that they're all working like a fine tuned machine.. . The service is usually pretty good. Only thing I would change is the god awful outfits these poor girls have to squeeze themselves into. Kinda dropped the ball there!
Let's just say one thing: don't expect them to let you in even if you come before closing time. We got to the place at 11:30pm, and there was one party ahead of us - so there was no line to get in. The hostess seats that party and then tells us that they are now closed and that we will not be able to dine there. There were no parties behind us. Okay what the hell was that! The restaurant clearly said it is open until midnight, not until 11:30pm. Absolutely ridiculous and rude. Never coming here again.
The aioli for the fries is great! I had the pork burger and it lacked seasoning...it was super bland. My girlfriend had the mushroom burger, it was the best I've tasted.
Don't go here on an empty stomach and you will love this place. We waited about 45 minutes to get a table for 2, soon as we were seated the line outside moved super fast (oh Murphy!). I did not care much for the earth burger, it was good but tasted bland, and surely not worth 15$? My husband loved the farm burger and our drinks and truffle fries were really good, so mixed feelings overall.. P.S: whats the deal with "gordon ramsay burgr" t shirts and caps on sale outside? Do people really buy those?
Gordon Ramsay's name is like a brand name. Just as people pick up Michael Kors purses for themselves, they want to try Gordon Ramsay's food, then post pictures and review it (like I am now!). . . Make sure you check in with the hostess before standing in line. The line is actually meant for groups of 2 or less. And trust me, there will probably be a line. Members of the Planet Hollywood club get seated right away. If you have more than 2 people, they will take your name down. I went during lunchtime. The wait for 3+ was 1 hour and half. The wait for 2 people was 20-30 minutes.. . We were given the option to sit at the back bar, and took it, just to sit down sooner. Honestly, though, it was the best option! We sat literally in front of the kitchen and were able to see the chefs work. By the way, the executive chef at BurGR right now is Christina Wilson, winner of season 10 of Hell's Kitchen. From what I know, she won the position of executive chef at Gordon Ramsay's Steak and then came to BurGR afterwards. . . My boyfriend and I decided to splurge. We both ordered shakes. I got the banana shake topped with butterscotch pudding and snickerdoodle cookie. The banana shake and the cookie were AMAZING. The butterscotch pudding was WAY too sweet though. My boyfriend ordered the oreo shake topped with creme brulee pudding, oreo, and a little bit of bruleed sugar. I LOVE LOVE LOVED this one. I don't even like oreo shakes, but the creme brulee pudding on top was just awesome.. . We also ordered the beer battered Maui onion rings topped with parmesan-reggiano served with curry ketchup and a Chipotle ranch dip. I will preface this by saying that I usually hate beer battered onion rings, primarily because more often than not, the batter is not crispy the way I like it. This one was SO GOOD. I think it was my favorite thing of the entire dining experience!!! The other side we ordered was the truffle parmesan fries with truffleoil, truffle salt, and truffle aioli. It was honestly nothing special. I would have been fine with the regular fries.. . As for the burger, we both ordered the farm burger. The patty is made of short rib, beef chuck, and brisket cooked to a medium rare. It is topped with a sharp English cheddar cheese, fried eggs, and... DUCK BREAST BACON... and placed between house-made toasted sesame buns. I wish I could get duck breast bacon to cook up and eat at home for breakfast... so delicious! It wasn't the best burger I've had, though... Those honors remain with the Office Burger at Father's Office in Los Angeles!!!. . I wanted to order the toffee bread pudding push pops, especially because I've tried his toffee bread pudding at another restaurant before... but I was so full after all the other yumminess, that I just couldn't do it.. . Overall, though,, a great experience. It was just a fun time, and I'm going to dream about the onion rings forever!
Some damn good food. Yummy burgers with tasty truffle fries and bomb ass jalapeno poppers. Creme brulee shake was delicious and in my opinion the best. The banana shake and #5 were decent. Wait was 30 mins.
Ridiculously cold, uncomfortable and awful customer service. After waiting in the line for more than an hour they told us that there is a waiting list for parties of more than two. They seated us at a table that was right in front of the door where the cold breeze was coming from. Manager's name was Jake Eaton and general manager Joana Holtey. They don't belong to this industry as they don't know customer service. The young little girl at the door raised her voice while I was talking to them about how cold and uncomfortable it was. The only good thing about the whole experience was our polite waiter Edward. I ordered hell's burger with jalapeno and avocado and wasn't even good.., it was tasteless, had no spices, they had a big chunk of unseasoned avocado on top.. With a small piece of jalapeno that wasn't evenly distributed. We asked if we could seat at the kitchen bar towards the back to be a bit warmer and They told us they won't sever at the kitchen bar but guess what they seated and served people right in front of our eyes. Go to "in and out burger" instead. I'm dead serious. They didn't even gave us free hot tea to warm up!!!!!
We had a reservation.We talked to the host and told her we have reservation for 6. she said we don't do reservations. We stayed in line for more than an hour. When we got to the host she said oh, party of 6 you could have just signed in on the waiting list. Well. It would have been nice if she had told us an hour ago. The restaurant is by the mall/casino entrance and freezing cold ( you can see entrance in the pic ). They have tables by the door with no heating system, no blocking walls,nothing. The host said if you want you can sit at this table( by the door) or wait additional 45 hours. The host was rude and was raising her voice. We talked to the manager ( Jake Eaton ) and he said you have to wait for an hour 40 mins in the waiting list. The next thing. There are 10-12 seats by the kitchen bar. We even offered to sit there but the manager Jake Eaton said we don't have server. I said there are always exceptions, why can't you make an exception and have someone serve us. He said I can't do that. Then 15 minutes later there were people sitting there. All I can say I expected a lot more from Gordon Ramsey. I was so excited to eat here but for sure it was ruined. I cannot recommend this place !! overpriced !! Rude staff !!Incompetent management !! The manager was good for nothing. He should get fired !! He knows nothing about customer service. He didn't even offer a discount. NEVER EVER !!
I was really in the mood for a burger so I thought I'd give Gordon Ramsey's Burgr a shot. It was just before it opened and I joined the line instead of being discouraged by the line. Good thing I did because when it opened we were seated quickly. I ordered the Hog burger and also tried the onion rings and parmesan fries. The burger was not dry and had a nice taste. The fries with the topping were also good. However the star for me was the onion rings. The breading/topping was crisp and did not fall off the onion. It made each bite delicious. I do regret not trying the milkshakes. One of those came by our table and wow it looked good... next time.
Our first stop in Vegas, no regrets! Best burger I have had in a while and it was the American, with the norm toppings.  Food quality is definitely noticeable. The decorations are great, atmosphere is great. Cant wait to go again! Highly Recommend it!
5-star for a burger place. It's one of those spots where you always see a line. But by the time you have your first bite, you know it's worth the wait. The roasted jalapeno popper was  amazing. The spiciness pairs perfectly with the crunchy breading. The moment when all the flavors explode in your mouth is enough to make one's day. Burgers are exceptionally tasty and juicy. The melted cheese curdled up all over the patty turned me on!!
