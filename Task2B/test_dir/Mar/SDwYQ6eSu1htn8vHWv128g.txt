Great place to grab some wine.
I love, love, love this place.   The Bruscetta is fantastic.  It is such a great place to go and just relax, grab a bite, wine and chill.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in town.  Try the red pepper bruscetta and the fig & proscuitto it is amazing!
I love the food hate the parking situation.
Our first and not our last visit. A great bottle of wine, soup and dinner! Bethany was the perfect wait staff, patiently walking us through the menu and wine list. A five star evening.
Not good ,, too small... n its overrated! who waits 1hr for a glass of wine., i would rather get a bottle n drink at home.
Love this place! . . Great food, super cool ambiance and can you say, "wine on tap"? Doens't get much better than that.
Another 5 starts for this wonderful restaurant!!  Not only do I love the food that's served here - I mean, best Bruschetta in town!!!  The customer service continues to WOW me everytime I visit!  I hosted my little sisters Bridal Shower here in the sofa lounge area of the restaurant and everyone just loved it.  There were 14 newbies to Postino Arcadia and they'll all be coming back to visit again!!  Thanks for helping me create such a memorable day for my baby sister!  She couldn't have been happier and that means the world to me :)
Love the food. Great food and great location. Some parking issues...but the valet made that problem go away.
Hands down one if the best restaurants in all of Arizona! Excellent food and atmosphere, Postino will quickly become one of your favorite places!
Great glass of Zin.  Wonderful ambiance and decor.
Parking is always a jam, but the food and atmosphere rocks.
I love Postino's! Great food, great staff! Get the bruschetta, you won't regret it!
We're probably the only people in town who haven't been to either Postino's. I don't know why it took us so long, but it won't be long before we go back, that's for sure. If you like wine, or even if you're not sure you like wine, you have to try this place. Huge variety and knowledgeable staff. Plus the food is delicious and the atmosphere relaxing and inviting.. . The afternoon we stopped in for lunch we ordered the half Panini and soup combo. Both the vegetarian and the Tuscan tuna sandwiches were really, really good. The bruschetta's that others nearby ordered all looked incredible - gotta come back for that!. . If you enjoy Spanish wine, the Lechuza is very nice.
The very best.  Plan and simple, can't beat positions!
Always a solid place to have a relaxing glass of wine and very casual laid back food! If you happen to visit the Phx area you should for sure add this place to your short list of stops!
You just can't go wrong with this place!! 20$ bottle of wine and board of bruschetta Monday &Tuesday.
So good! i ordered the bruschetta (delicious) and a panini! both were great! I also enjoyed their famous amazingly good moscato de asti !
What's there not to love about this place? Well, the parking sucks but that's why they entice you with valet. Other than that, on any given Monday or Tuesday, you won't find a better place filled with friendly staff, a collection of mesmerizing characters diversing over delish carbs that would destroy your waistline but then who's counting when you can lock eyes with the hottie across your bottle of wine? At $20 for a bruschetta board and bottle of wine, you really can't go wrong in kicking off your week on a happy note. During the rest of the week, it's good food with the ambience of a quaint spot reserved for good friends over long conversations. Noise level might be challenging for first dates, but I think it's fail proof if all you have is radio silence :)
OMG I love this place!  This is a favorite when I am hosting out of towners - it has been a hit every time!  I love love love love love the Bruschetta.  Usually we have made this a dinner spot, but a few weeks ago I went for Saturday lunch with my mom and her friend.  It was the perfect spot - they had the back walls opened up to outside and the atmosphere was fabulous for a social midday meal.  Other favorites on the menu are: prosciutto and brie panini and the mediterranean salad, add turkey.  Additionally, the wine selection is wonderful!
