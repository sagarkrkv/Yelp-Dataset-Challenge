I found the rooms spacious, well appointed, very clean and had a great view.  We were above a nightclub so the heartbeat off bass from the music was quite audible but not necessarily unpleasant.  Staff was extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. The casino itself is gorgeously decorated and very little smell of smoke.  One of my favorites!
Honestly. I was very excited to stay here because of the name. However it fell short to meet expectations it set for itself for being a five star resort. First thing... If you're young they do not treat you as well as they do with their older clientele. Or at least in my experience that is what happened. I have stayed in many hotels and I do consider myself a hotel connessuer... For the price I paid it wasn't five star service. Also I have asked for hot water for coffee, tea, and for noodles (I'm Asian). We had to pay for a hot water kettle ( I guess that's fine but other five star wouldn't nickel and dime like that)...and on top of paying for it ,the water in the kettle have us a horrible nauseating feeling... It was so bad I had to go clubbing sober..... Because I didn't want to puke noodles all over the club. So if you wish to has a five star vacation in Vegas. Stay at city center. Stay at Cosmo, stay at mandarin oriental.  If you want to go to Wynn and encore. Just come for the high end dining and overpriced clubs. In my opinion... The type of people that pay to stay at encore aren't looking for quality but paying for the flash that they are staying at encore.  So disappointed. Rooms were clean and architecturally it was beautiful... However to be a five star you need to treat all guest regardless of age, gender, race, creed as if they are VIPs... Because money is money.  With that said I give this hotel a 3 star despite it's claim of being a five star. Another pseudo five star resort in Las Vegas.
I have been a patron of this establishment for many years. My brother is a dj in vegas and I always refer this place even when he has his friends stay at cosmopolitan but after my last experience I will never stay and I will never refer this establishment to my friends.. . I arrived at the Encore and felt the usual excitement of Vegas and I was stoked because I love the red decor and the smell of their air fresheners. I was greeted by the front desk as usual checkin was smooth. After I got into the room I wanted a shower... that was until I saw blood all over the damn shower. I chose to skip the shower and ask for them to fix the issue. The front desk said they would send someone up. After about an hour and a half they finally sent someone to clean the windows....yes I said windows. I had to specify the shower is what needed to be cleaned because there was blood. I left the room and when I came back the room smelled so strongly of bleach I didn't want to stay in it. I left and came back decided to shower and the blood was still all over the place. Since it had been now a day since showering I had to stand on the bench to avoid contact with the blood.. . I wish it got better but it did not. I was visiting my best friend for his birthday and we decided to have a few drinks in the room and talk as it had been a while since we had spoken and a security guard by the name of Anthony stopped at the door to let us know we needed to quiet down because we had noise complaints. We had no music or anything out of the ordinary and he said he didn't hear anything but was instructed to ask us to quiet down. He came for a second time and said this is your third warning and your friend must leave. I asked who I needed to speak with to handle the issue. Anthony said to speak with the casino manager, that would have been helpful if that person was available but I had to speak with the front desk manager who said if I didn't quiet down she would have to kick me out..... . After I left vegas and submitted my complaint via the email survey it took 3 weeks to get a response and they said my feedback was important and had been sent to management... 2 months later I am posting this review, I gave them ample time to respond to me and I still have not heard from them other than their spam post mail with offers to stay with them. . . Do not waste your valuable and hard earned money here. They do not treat their customers with respect. Do not be fooled. Stay at the Aria, I already booked there and feel way more welcomed by them I was assigned a personal concierge and a direct line to her office and this is only my first time booking there/. I will post my review of the Aria soon which I am sure will be much better than BLOOD all over my bathroom and being threatened to be kicked out for talking to a friend in my room that I paid for.
Of all the hotels in Las Vegas, the Wynn and the Encore are probably my favourite so perhaps I'm a little biased for this review.. . In my experience, everything works well at the Encore, check-in is smooth and devoid of staff who have "just started and it's my first day so bear with me", In my opinion the Wynn properties feel a little more homely than other hotels that are anonymous and very cookie cutter.. . On this occasion I had a Strip View suite, I have no idea which one but it was a suite. The room is very well appointed with a sitting area, a work area, a very nice bed and a great bathroom. I was told that with a Strip View room I might be able to hear noise from the nightclubs XS and Surrender. I didn't notice it so it wasn't a problem.. . As with most Vegas hotels now they levy a "resort tax" which is $25 a day here. It covers off Wifi access (which works beautifully for a change) and you can use the in room telephone anywhere in the USA. One of my only complaints about the room was that it's looking a little dated and in some areas a little worn.. . My other complaint was related to a late check out request I made, I had to make some important calls at 1pm which is the latest gratis check out they can do apparently. To extend the check out further was going to cost over $200. I decided to call again and ask, this time the front desk extended it another hour for free. Why they didn't offer this in the first place I don't know.. . A great stay and it's a pity I don't get to stay more often as most of the conferences and trade shows I attend are elsewhere in Las Vegas.
The very best, Modern clean and spacious suite, awesome views of strip, impeccable service, very efficient front desk, concierge  and valet.. Steve Wynn is the King of Vegas... Cannot find better in Las Vegas if you like luxury .. . Bravo..
Do I really need to review this place!  . This was the best place hands down to go we will be back again.  Five stars why OK let me tell you. Customer service, cleanliness, views, spas, and best room set up. It was like a  hgtv get away!
Terrible stay. Not a five star hotel. Room had dust everywhere(window panes, ac vent, desk, lamp shades, around tv, ceiling lights, bathroom lights) pen and blue stuff on shower floor, white stains on couch and window (appeared to be semen), hand prints all over window, food crumbs with opened crystal light and Special K wrapper in bedside drawer, in closet drawer had previous guests receipts, tissues, clothes tags, and medication papers. Complained to asst. housekeeping; did not want to move since we were staying short time but told us room would be clean 9:30 am next day. Left came back around 1 pm room wasn't touched. Left came back room was still dirty. Complained again to 2nd manager. Complained again to housekeeping manager and finally room was cleaned properly. Offered us a $50 food comp which we didn't use. Food it overpriced anyway so I don't even think we woukdve gotten one meal from that. Asked for it to be applied to our hotel bill upon checkout, couldn't do that. Extremely disappointed. Felt we were treated like 2nd class citizens bc we are younger than the typical encore guests. Called hotel after we got home, said there's nothing else they could do and was confrontational about the whole situation. If problem would've been solved properly after first complaint, we would've been okay. And the amount of grossness we encountered within the first 15 minutes of unpacking was terrible. I've stayed at the days inn and it has been cleaner. Only thing that was good was the bed, view was ruined but the nasty white stains. Management needs to work on customer satisfaction. Super overpriced, no complimentary coffee. I'vestayed at five star hotels that give free wifi and coffee. Everything costs extra money here. Stay at bellagio if your looking for an upper class hotel stay, will never stay at the disgusting place. Poor resolution of issues.
What's not to love about the Wynn Hotel?. Well, ok, maybe if you received bad service or had a terrible experience. But customer service is really good there for the most part. Other than that, this is my most favorite hotel resort on the strip. From the decor of classic red and off-white colors and chandeliers hung above a high ceiling, to the scent of the hotel once you walk in. It gives me such a nostalgic feeling. . . Asian theme hotel. Mr. Wynn loves the Asian culture so it's only right to open a hotel with Red colors and have a restaurant in the hotel called Red 8. The lucky number 8 in the Asian culture. . Home to the hotness night clubs, XS, and the day club pool party, Encore Beach Club. I always have the best time at these venues, not forgetting Tryst. Rooms itself is spacious and the beds are amazingly comfortable. . . I came in this trip to meet with a potential job offer in Special Events. The meeting went very well. We shall see if this will be the right fit for me in this city.
The Encore.  This one of the best hotel in Vegas over priced but an great staff with all the amenities anyone could ask for.  The rooms and the view of Vegas is so good you can't ever put it to words.. . This is the third year in a role and I will be back.. . Thanks Wynn you do great work, let's work on the restaurant.
This review is for the CASINO FLOOR only. I didn't stay here, thank goodness. . . My friends and I stayed at The Mirage but stopped here just to check out the casino and play some slots. It was March Madness weekend so all of the TVs were showing the games. After playing a bit, I decided to watch some basketball. All the seats at one bar were taken, and there was another bar that was closed next to it that also had TVs with the game on. So, naturally, a few of us bar patrons bought a drink at one bar, then sat at the closed bar area just to watch the game. . . Now, this bar is not a closed space. It's just a counter with chairs along a casino walkway. So, many people who walked through stopped periodically to watch the game. Soon, bar staff walked behind the counter and said nothing to us as we watched, and we didn't bother them. Then a security guard comes by and says that since the bar is closed, we can't sit at the counter and have to leave. Yes, his exact words were "You have to leave." Mind you, we were all paying customers with drinks on hand. We weren't yelling or screaming. We were all actually pretty quiet enjoying the game. He stayed there until everyone picked up their drink in amazement and began to leave.. . If we were loud, or brought in outside food, or took up space that other paying customers needed, I'd understand. But hell, we bought drinks at the bar next door which had no empty seats left. And the seats at this bar weren't being used. Even the bar workers didn't care we sat there.. . I got similar treatment watching some of the card games. I got rude dealers asking, "Well are you going to play?" This place just cares about taking your money and places zero premium on customer service. I would never stay here even if they comped me a room.
