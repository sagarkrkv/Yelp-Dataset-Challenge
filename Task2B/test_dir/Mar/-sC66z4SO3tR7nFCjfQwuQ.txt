This place was a nice surprise! Really fresh and modern. The food is a great new take on Mexican flavors. Every single thing I ordered was delicious and I couldn't change a thing.. . Everyone was so friendly and inviting. Loved the ambiance. Even though I ordered to go and they had a whole room filled with customers, they still took the time to make recommendations and even offer me water as I waited. Really nice!
We live in North Phoenix near Desert Ridge and decided to try something new for Sunday breakfast. HIGHLY disappointed with this choice. We waited about 10 min for a table and asked for some coffee while we were waiting. The coffee station was a mess and out of creamer. When I asked for more they just handed me an open carafe and asked for it back when I was done. . . Once we were seated we waited 30 minutes until finally we asked a busser to send over a waiter. When the food arrived my omelette was cold and lacking flavor and salt. I wouldn't come back or recommend to anyone.
Considering that this place is supposed to be a high class Mexican restaurant I was pretty disappointed. Not many places have chilaquiles on their menu. This place has it but it's nowhere near any authentic chilaquiles I've had. The food is very fancy, but it lacked in flavor and authenticity. The guacamole was not completely disappointing but I wouldn't come back to have it again. The agua fresca is definitely also better at Ranch Market. My niece ordered quesadillas from the kids menu and she got two small corn tortillas with cheese in it and was still hungry afterwards.
Busy for a Sunday evening out so that was a good sign. Hip vibe but not pretentious or "too cool" vibe. Note, you can order to go and take your meal to the rooftop of the hotel to which it's attached. We had a friendly server but did get lost in the shuffle towards the end of our meal. However, it got slammed when we were wrapping up our meal and do not begrudge the servers for that. The food was excellent. . . The guac was chunky with a more citrus flavor. Tacos were a great spin on street tacos. I had a fish, a shrimp and a carne asada. The carne was crisp and then chewy. The shrimp had just enough kick. The fish was tilapia that night and that was citrisuy and had a bit of avocado for a refreshing flavor. The elote as an app was deliciously bad for you as it should be. Our party of three shared the elote as we just wanted a taste, but this is easily edible for one hungry person. Our friend had the chicken burrito which was ginormous. If we had room, I would've stayed to try dessert. Good for parties up to 8 people.
The outside patio makes this a cool spot, but in Phoenix... this is AVERAGE Mexican food. Tried 3 different kinds of their street tacos (cochinita, carne asada and shrimp) -wasn't impressed with them or the bland salsa. I will give them credit for great happy hour prices and canned tecate though!
Cool place, cool atmosphere, really good tacos, and the prices are very reasonable. The live music component was really neat. Unique dinning experience.
Came on a Wednesday night and was told it was a 30 minute wait for inside but we could be seated immediately outside. My party was fine with the patio...but the tables are so freaking close together! I literally was bumping heads with the person sitting behind me. Anyways, the food was awesome. I had the Bloody Maria and shrimp&grits. Guacamole was great too! Just knocked one star off for bad seating and our server really wasn't that great. She was super awkward and never even checked to see how the food was or anything.
Busy on weekend mornings but love love love their bloody Mary's!!!!! It has become a tradition w my girlfriends. I am not a fan of bloody Mary's normally but these are amazing.   The food is awesome and the atmosphere is upbeat and quarkie.
They have a great environment. Some very great mixed drinks & the most amazing burrito I have found in Arizona. The waiters are all very pelite & upbeat personality,
Came for breakfast. Have to say, the bloody Mary's are very flavorful! Citrus with a good amount of flavor spice, and not too thick/filling; served with jicama, olive, celery, lemon, and lime. Probably one of our favorite bloody Mary's. We had a 10am reservation, and we were seated around 10:15. The restaurant was quite busy. We placed our order around 10:30. Food came around 11. The meals were well prepared. The chilaquiles were my favorite! Very savory with chicken, vegetables, and an egg over easy on top. Torta bread was fluffy and delicious. Tortillas were great. All the produce was very fresh. Presentation for some of our meals (burritos, chorizo breakfast) was a little lacking,  but that doesn't take away from the flavor. In the end, everyone in our 7 person party was happy!
Great tacos and the house salad was awesome
Ensalada cortada- nice mix of kale and greens with corn nuts. The small was quite small. . . The shrimp and verduras de temporada tacos are quite good; nice seasonings and mix of flavors although not the best I've ever had. . . I got the picoso cocktail by accident and that was delicious; I should have stuck with it instead of my original order of the pisco sour cocktail. While it was strong the pisco itself is only mediocre-tasting. I have had MUCH better @Raymi in NYC.  . . There is also a new draft white wine on the menu called Tazi (I think). It is terrible, utterly terrible. Even our waitress spit it out in the bushes after tasting it! . . Otherwise great service and very cool interior decor and nice outdoor seating space.
No reflection on the kitchen at all, good food every time I've been here so far.. But! Service, is seriously lacking from a few foh members. From the hostess tonight who  wasn't very helpful, to bartenders who took 11minutes to pour 3beers when they're not busy at all, to sitting amidst an un bussed table full of empty glasses and elbow sticking booze residue for over an hour! Are you kidding me.. Some foh staff seem more concerned with how trendy their outfits are than looking out for their clientele.. Seriously Gallo, get your foh as good as the kitchen and 2 star reviews won't happen.
Gallo Blanco is a fun, hip place.  We had a great time and cannot wait to return.. . We ordered the guacamole (yum, different, but still yum) and the grilled corn as appetizers.  Although the corn is served with a knife so you can politely enjoy it without corn and cheese all over your face... we chose to just go for it and we greatly enjoyed it (even with corn and cheese on our faces).  For dinner we had the Noca Torta and a variety of tacos - fish (grilled tilapia), carne asada, and cochinita pibil.  The torta was stellar - seriously, don't change it one bit and YES get the eggs over easy.  The tacos were delicious, the fish and carne asada were better than the cochinita pibil (surprisingly, because chochinita pibil is (no joke) one of my favorite foods).  For dessert we had crepes with bananas and caramel - it was ok, but I wished I'd selected something else.. . The service team was great although, it seemed, they were under staffed.  This was mostly noticeable when we would order another round of drinks.  20-30 minutes later they'd finally make it to our table.  Our waiter continually apologized saying the bar was slammed (yes, I could see how the bar could be slammed with a full restaurant and what appeared to be only one bartender). Hopefully this was just an off night, maybe they had a call in... or maybe its standard.  I guess I'll find out next time we go!
Oh God. The first few months that I started coming here, I was obsessed. Their guacamole? Untouchable. But then I had one really weird experience and every time I returned it just kept getting worse and worse. Seriously. From getting ignored by my waiter, to being avoided afterwards, to only getting checked on once, tohaving luke warm, soggy tacos. After one horrible awkward experience to another, my bad experiences were to be expected. I would recommend going to their OTHER sister restaurant, Cresent Ballroom. Their bean and cheese burrito with the green salsa and chips are "to die for."
Shrimp and grits! To die for!. . best mexican ive had
I went to Gallo Blanco last night with a group of 8, and, overall, I was very happy!  The food was fantastic.  I had the guacamole, smoked elote, a carne asada taco, a shrimp taco, and the tres leches cake.  I loved everything, but especially the elote and the tres leches.  The tres leches was topped with ice cream and strawberry sauce, and it was some of the best I've ever had!  I tasted a friend's shrimp and grits, and that was quite good as well.  I'm from the southeast, so I'm picky about shrimp and grits, and I was pleasantly surprised that it was as good as it was!  I also had a glass of sangria, which was alright, but it was pretty sweet, and there was more fruit in the glass than drink.  That was disappointing.  The service also was not fantastic.  I understand serving a larger group can be difficult, but there were 20 or more minute time spans where we never saw our server.  We were sitting in the lounge area, and the server basically told us that she kind of forgets about that area...not exactly what we wanted to hear.  She was nice and got our orders correct, but I would have preferred a little more attention, especially since we were a larger group.  My only other complaint was that it was rather warm in the area where we were seating, and there's nothing more uncomfortable to me than trying to eat while you're sweating.  Having said that, I really enjoyed the meal, and I will definitely go back.  With everything I ate, my check was under $25 for happy hour!
Came here for lunch on a Friday and enjoyed it very much.  Nice atmosphere, lovely outdoor seating, friendly staff.  We shared fish tacos and the carne asada burrito and the food was really good; very well seasoned.
Recommended by our hotel .. Gonna egg the concierge' car. You know you've been misled when the best part of an "authentic Mexican  meal" is the a arugula salad. Bad food, bad margaritas, charming but clueless servers.  Skip it.
I've been a fan for many years but the last few times I have to say, the service is lackluster, to say the least. The food is great and a good value- so I suppose one can't complain. However, it makes you wonder how much better the dining experience would be with a well managed staff. Maybe just avoid the place on the weekends....
Can't do a PHX trip without stopping here.  The hardest part is trying to decide what to get.  Always delicious, never disappointing!
