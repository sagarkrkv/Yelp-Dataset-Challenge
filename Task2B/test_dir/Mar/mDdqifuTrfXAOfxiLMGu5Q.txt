I'm having trouble thinking of how to even start this review. Yum. Nom. Delicious. OH MY GOODNESS IS THIS WHAT HEAVEN IS LIKE? All come to mind. . . The wait staff is amazing and friendly as well as attentive. Our waiter was fine. Like super hot. And super nice. I almost wanted to ask him to have my babies. . . Christina is gorgeous (winner of Hell's Kitchen) and was working the line. She looked dedicated to her job and it was amazing watching her work. . . First off, the bread beforehand is already great. If that was any indication of where the food was going, we were super excited. . . My date and I ordered the beef wellington for 2 and IT LIVES UP TO ITS HYPE. We both moaned non-stop as we ate. Only downfall is that the pastry puff kept falling off but otherwise, I tore into that dish. I cleaned my plate so well, everyone was shocked. . . My parents ordered the rib-eye that was made to perfection.  They couldn't stop raving about it. My mom ate her whole rib eye even though she wasn't even hungry because she just couldn't stop. Then she asked me if she could have half my dish!!! I told her to back off. Hah. . . We also had a side of the mac & cheese. The cheese extremely strong and slightly smelly but oh so good. . . If you're hitting up Vegas, GO! I'm telling you now to GO! My mom actually said this was the best steak she ever had and she didn't even want to go at first!!! . . They also have a Hell's Kitchen menu that includes Scottish Egg, Scallops w. Risotto, a Beet Salad dish, Beef Wellington and for dessert, a Toffee type dessert.. . FYI you can get the Scottish Egg and Toffee dessert at GR's Pub & Grill at Caesar's so you don't have to stick to the HK $145 per person (and the WHOLE table has to do the HK menu if you're doing that) menu! . . ENJOY!
I am a frequently Yelper, but I have never felt inclined to write a review, but after visiting Gordon Ramsay Steak on 2/27 with my significant other I feel like I have a new found appreciation for fine dining and food.. . My significant other is not much for red meat, but she was coerced by the impressive meat display and explanations for each cut and ordered the Kobe American Rib Cap. Despite the great displays I was dead set on ordering Gordon's signature dish, the Roasted Beef Wellington. As sides, we ordered the Mac & Cheese and Roasted Heirloom Carrots.. . The Beef Wellington was great. It melts in your mouth and the pastry complimented the filet very nicely. While it was great, I would never order it again because of how amazingly delicious the few bites of the Rib Cap I was able to steal from my significant other. Wow. The cut was perfect. Full-flavored and succulent. I'm not sure a steak could be prepared any better.. . The sides: The Roasted Heirloom Carrots were the best carrots I have ever had. Don't be scared of the hot wing sauce. They are not overly spicy. The combination of the sweetness of the carrot with the sauce and being roasted was a delightful treat. Now, comes the Mac & Cheese. I was skeptical that mac & cheese was on the menu of a fine establishment, but it made me think there must be a reason for it. So, I took the plunge and I was not disappointed. The other reviews don't do it justice. One cheese doesn't overpower the other. It was the perfect storm of cheesy goodness. A cheese tornado if you will. I don't know how I will eat mac & cheese again and not reminisce about this dish.. . The service was great. We weren't constantly harassed and the staff knew what we wanted even before we asked for it.. . The visit was great. Having recently taken a trip to Paris, France, Paris Hotel & Casino brought back memories of walking along the Seine and sitting in front of the Eiffel Tower in all its glory.. . There are tons of fantastic places to eat in Las Vegas, but if you have an opportunity to visit Gordon Ramsay Steak I would recommend doing so.
Went on V-day weekend and was not impressed. We ordered a bunch of different dishes and said we wanted to share. They ended up serving our steak cut up into pieces and that was disappointing. The juices had run out and honestly tasted room temperature. The plates were not heated either and overall the food was not great. The steak taste a bit tough and the staff were always in a rush. I definitely won't be coming back and would rather spend my money at Mastro's steakhouse.
Gordon Ramsay, you truly did not disappoint me. I came here twice in 2013, late post but better late than never. I can still remember the great dishes they served here. Also, I liked their menus, it is not a typical open-it-up menu, but all info is one button away on a iPad. haha so clever!. . My friend and I arrived a little earlier than our reservation. We stopped by the bar and I order Pim's this is a girly fruity drink, right up my alley. I am not a heavy drinker and get the asian glow after a couple of sips. This drink was refreshing and light enough for me to handle. Must give this drink a try if you are not a heavy drinker, but want a little something to sip on. . . The two times I've been here were both really enjoyable meals for me. We ordered half a dozen of oysters, they were very fresh and tasty with the sauces they provide along with the appetizer. We also ordered the beet salad, this is very light and refreshing and the beets were cooked nicely. For the main dish I ordered the 8oz American Rib Cap cooked medium rare, you cannot go wrong with this one. It is nice and tender cooked to perfection. I was told that this piece of meat has the most marbles all around, you can really taste it and that's why the meat is so tender, plus the price for it says it all!  For the sides we order the mashed potatoes, and it was very smooth and yummy. Perfection combination when eaten with a piece of rib cap! . . If you are ever in Las Vegas, you should treat yourself to this place. It will not disappointment. I usually will not go back to eat at the same fine dining restaurant again unless it is unforgettable tasty food and I must go back for more! This is one of them, go try for yourself.
I had my first beef wellington, and I was so not disappointed! It was a bit rare for my usual taste, but it didn't bother me. The bread - OMG. Also, the sticky toffee pudding was perfect.
Great food and atmosphere. The iPad menus were a little strange, even for younger diners like us. Overall the food was great. Highly recommend the beef wellington. Probably wouldn't go back but a good steakhouse for a Vegas trip!
The selection of steak is solid-- USDA Prime, dry aged at least 28 days, real Kobe beef grade A5 for the obligatory princely sum. Just make sure you have a reservation or else good luck getting seated.... . Filet mignon and New York strips are excellent, as is the Kobe. The ribeye, on the other hand, was just okay-- I expected better given the glazing and dry aging they claim to do.. . Much like the ribeye, the seafood platter was also just okay. They actually had excellent clams, shrimp, and lobster, but the oysters were a serious letdown. The rest of the meal made up for it, though, with a delicious scotch egg, a solid baked potato, and a ridiculously good haricot vert (tempura-battered green beans). Gnocchi was also a hit.. . Real reason for this rating? We had perhaps the slowest meal in the whole restaurant. The tables surrounding us, we saw some had changed over twice in the time we were there, I think one might've changed over three times. The wait between courses was excruciating untilthe main courses all came out at once. The scotch egg? The seafood platter? I think they were birthing the chickens one by one in the back, and the seafood must've still be on the way from the airport when we ordered.. . Waiting for dessert (the toffee thing was awesome) wasn't too bad, but it was definitely more waiting...
Oh boy. You expect to get great service and even better food from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, right? Our service was sub-par. We waited extremely long for a menu, then even longer for our order to be taken. We asked to be served bread since we were quite hungry from waiting, and I could see the waiter roll his eyes. Meanwhile a gentleman sits next to us and chats with the waiter about the menu. 60 seconds after that conversation a server walks up and begins to drop the bread at the table next to us, and I noticed the waiter motion to our table so we did finally get the bread. We started to notice that this person next to us was getting attentive and fast service when it struck me that he was a food/restaurant critic as he was taking notes on his phone after each conversation and bite of food. Professional or amateur I'm not sure, but he was given noticeably better service than any other table around.. The variety of bread was nice and included 2 types of brioche. We ordered sliders as an appetizer, which were pretty good. The main course: I ordered a special they had that night which was the "eye" of the ribeye, rare. He ordered the full ribeye, medium well and we ordered a baked potato to share (all sides are to be added on and are enough to share). My "rare" steak was medium and so was his "medium-well" ...I guess they just evened it out. The baked potato looked as though it had been sitting because the sauce on top had developed the film that warm dairy does after sitting. The steaks were tasty- can't say anything negative about the quality of the meat, and the skins of the potato were seasoned and delicious. I enjoyed that they bring around a "meat tray" that is like a dessert tray, except with all the cuts of steak offered. Can't say I would return next time I'm in Vegas, nor do I think I would recommend to friends.
This place was truly delicious. Their ribeye probably ranks second on the list of steaks that I've tried behind Mastros in Beverly Hills. However, I tried a few bites of Ramsey's rib cap, and that, by far, is the best steak I've ever had. It's a shame they give you such a small cut for such a high price - I usually want to eat at least an 18oz steak if I'm paying more than $50 for it! But that aside, it was simply amazing. One of my favorite things this restaurant did was to present the uncooked steaks to us so we would know what we were ordering - the steaks they showed us were beautiful - I could stare at them forever!. . The sides were also really good - the one that stood out to me was the bone marrow. Cooked to perfection. I tried the bone marrow at Wicked Spoon the day after and it was such a disappointment - could not compare. . . Everything that this restaurant served was delicious.
I decided to become a pescatarian for Lent so I went here on a whim to treat myself. Go big or go home, right? . . I ordered the beef wellington, of course. It was delicious. Cooked perfectly in my opinion. I don't like overly seasoned steak. I feel that if it's cooked right, the taste of the meat shouldn't be covered in sauces and seasoning. The couple of potato and carrot pieces that came with the plate were firmer than I'd had before. I didn't think I'd like that, but it was a pleasant surprise. I got the mushrooms on the side, which were a bit of a disappointment to me. I don't know if it was the mushrooms themselves, or the sauce used to cook them in, but something tasted both too earthy and fishy at the same time. Weird description, I know. I'm sorry, I don't know how else to describe them.. . They provided me with a plate of a variety of little breads to try. The one with bacon was my favorite, of course!. . All in all, it was a nice experience. Went on a Tuesday evening, no reservations, so I sat in the bar/lounge area. Totally fine with this, as it was nearly empty, and I liked being pretty much alone. As people started flowing in, I was on my way out. Perfect! The only thing I didn't like, was that the music was so darn loud in there. I'm getting old. Loud music belongs in a handful of places: clubs, concerts, parties. Not restaurants or mall shops. Maybe I'm just an old grump. I have no idea if the dining room area is a little quieter. Hope so, or I don't know how you'd hear your date. But then, if you don't want to.... . Service was excellent. Loved my servers.
very good. we got the beef wellington with a mashed potato puree, omigosh soooo good. The baked potato was NOT good to me, it didn't taste like a normal baked potato, had this yucky creamy cheese that was seasoned with too much garlic?? The mac n cheese was not tasty either, was oversalted in my opinion but the beef welli, ribeye and filet were awesome! very pricey though.
Best steak of my life! I'm not kidding! This place is fantastic- I don't even know where to begin. I didn't think the greens beans would be one of the most memorable parts of my dish. I think it caught me off guard how amazing green beans could taste. The steak is out of this world- it cuts like butter. And there isn't a better way to end your meal than with sticky toffee pudding!
Another excite dinner at Gordon Ramsey's steak house. Thank you Charles N. for taking care of us, very professional, great service & great food. Ordered the rib cap medium rare, mushrooms, and the oysters were awesome.
It's exactly what you would expect and hope for from chef Gordon Ramsay. Steaks were perfect and the sides were delisciously cooked with unexpected ingredients. I was also pleased to find a great whiskey selection. Incredible experience.
The best food I've ever had.  The music is not as intrusive as some reviews suggested.  Everything was simply amazing.  My wife had the Kobe rib cap which was super tasty and I had the beef Wellington which was perfect.  Ironically I'd had this dish 2 weeks ago somewhere else but this version was vastly superior.  Had the Mac n cheese side which was amazing.  I couldn't stop eating it.  The brioche was so good we asked for more.  The beer selection was great even for a beer snob like myself.   Service was top notch and well orchestrated.  Can't say enough good things about this experience.  We'll be back.
We stopped by here on a whim on our last night in Vegas (we're huge Gordon Ramsay fans!). It was about 10:30 or 11 at night so, as we expected, they were all booked for dinner but had seats open in the lounge/bar. We sat at the empty bar and ordered a long island and a screwdriver. The servers were attentive but not polite. The bar menu has ten options - we got the sliders and gnocchi. Our food arrived relatively quickly and was plated nicely. My dish had about seven gnocchi, with dry-cured ham, heirloom tomatoes, and shaved cheese. However, my gnocchi was cold. Not like room temperature, but cold. I ate it anyway and it was fine, though I think it would have been much better if it were hot when I had gotten it. My boyfriend received a plate with two sliders, which he says "were fine. Nothing special but not bad.". . Although our food wasn't fantastic, I definitely wouldn't write this place off. It's hard to judge a place based on their bar food only, especially when we didn't order steak at a place known for its delicious steak. I'd like to go back for a full dinner. My only real complaint would be the staff. From the hostess to the bartenders to the person who brought our food, I had the feeling that I was more of a nuisance than a paying customer. The next time I'm in the city, I'll try this place again.
Loved the presentation of the meat selections and our waiter's assistant, Jose! Something felt like it was missing though. I wish I could say what! It almost seemed like everything could have been bigger or better placed.... . Filet and Wellington were delicious. Beware: if you order the ravioli appetizer, it is one little piece...
This place is awesome. The service and food were excellent.  I had the signature dish Beef Wellington along with the Brussel sprouts. It was amazing. My Yo-Yo had the 8 oz Filet and Caesar Salad. Overall, the experience was delightful.
The atmosphere is loud and it is right off the casino floor so that should be noted. The presentation was very nice and the selections of beef were excellent. I stared with a Caesar salad with a scotched quail egg which had just the right amount of cheese and dressing on it, then followed that up with an American Kobe beef skirt steak. The steak was cooked just how I like it and I felt it was one of the better steaks I have eaten. Excellent meal, good service, mediocre atmosphere.
After eating here, I'm questioning every five star review I've ever given.  This restaurant  is truly deserving of five stars.. . My boyfriend and I came in this past Saturday and was welcomed by a very friendly staff.  We had made reservations, so there was only a short wait while the host checked to see if our table was ready. After my boyfriend took a smoke break, the girl led us into the restaurant and welcomed us to London and described the meaning behind the red chandelier/art piece that was hanging on the ceiling. She then let us know that our booth was on the upper floor and gave us the option of the stairs or elevator. We said we didn't mind either one and she led us up the short staircase.. . She seated us and left. We were immediately greeted by Muuhamaduu(spelling?) and offered drinks. After he left, Tony came and introduced himself letting us know he'd be back to explain the meats.  He was thorough and answered any questions we had.  He kept a smile on his face the whole time, which I found to be very warm and welcoming. After Tony's presentation, we settled on the mac n cheese, beef Wellington, and the rib cap for my boyfriend. . . The food came out quickly.  My boyfriend had taken a smoke break (again) during this time, and the servers and waiters were very friendly and joked that they would finish his dinner if he didn't come back in time.. . The mac n cheese was the most delicious mac n cheese I've ever eaten. My boyfriend said it didn't beat his favorite boxed velveeta, but he still finished it off. The beef Wellington and rib cap was also amazing.  There is no words to describe how delicious it was. What surprised me was the few pieces of vegetables that were served with the beef Wellington. I hate carrots, my boyfriend loves carrots, and some how, this was the best piece of carrot either of us had ever eaten.. . We finished off our meal by ordering the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Muuhammaduu guessed what I wanted before I ordered and said it was one of the best things there. It was actually one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  Get it. It's amazing. Boyfriend agreed and was scraping the bottom of the plate when we were done.. . During our meal Tony and Muuhammaduu were very attentive and friendly.  They talked to us and asked how things were, offered suggestions, and even chit chatted with us.  They were awesome and I would love to work with them again.  Thanks guys for the great night!
My bf & I have always been fans of Gordon Ramsay. After watching the whole season of Master Chef Jr. I was mindblown at how those little kids could replicate Ramsay's infamous beef wellington. Everytime I see pics of his wellington, I start salivating, hoping to try it one day. Well...THE DAY FINALLY CAME!! I know he has the London West Hollywood restaurant in L.A., which served the wellington, but the reviews weren't great. I'm so glad I waited to try his food in Vegas, rather than the L.A. restaurant!. . We had reservations at 9:30pm, but arrived to vegas a little late Fri night due to traffic. Luckily, they were able to accommodate us at 10:15PM.. NOTE: HELL'S KITCHEN TASTING MENU STOPS AT 930PM. . We were guided through the "tunnel" and given the option to our table upstairs via elevator or stairs. The view upstairs is amazing with this giant neon structure of Gordon's hands making the wellington. The interior is chic decorated in colors of black and red w/ a big British flag painted on the ceiling. Downstairs is an open kitchen, bar, and framed photos of Ramsay. It's very classy yet romantic at the same time. . Our server Yaron was such a sweetheart! We came for our anniversary & he made it very memorable. I felt like royalty dining in this restaurant!  After browsing the menu, Yaron pulled up the meat cart and the carnivore in me wanted to devour every meat on that cart! He said that if I finished the 24oz bone in rib eye, he'd applaud and give me a free t-shirt. I will most definitely be back to take on this challenge :D. . Shortly after ordering, the fresh breads came out on a plate (different than most places serving it in a basket). We ended up eating 2 plates of the bread 'cause it was so bomb! I wanted to get some to-go at the end of the night, but forgot to ask. ALL4 VARIETY OF BREADS WERE SOO GOOD. My fav were the brioches w/ truffle and pancetta (bacon). The walnut baguette was good as well especially w/ the butter. I LOVE the butter here w/ the sea salt. Gives texture & taste. . . English Chowder - smoked haddock, scallops, fingerling medallions, . citrus pearls. Wow at first I thought it'd be like clam chowder, but this takes chowder to a different level. Initially it came out in the soup bowl w/ just the scallop, haddock, etc. & then the server pours out the soup from a little pot. Very nice, thick consistency yet not over laden w/ butter. Scallop was cooked to perfection! It was a very filling soup, not your typical chowder.. . Maine Lobster - O..M..G.. the lobster was a work of art. The lobster cream was delicious, I wanted to lick the whole plate. Lobster was cooked to succulent and had a beautiful red color. Very tender, buttery smooth, fresh. The lentils were cooked perfectly as well, but I do wish that they accompanied this dish w/ something else other than lentil.. . Beef Wellington for 2 - Over $100 for this bad boy. It's funny the say for 2, when really it's just one wellington, but cut in half. So usually if you order wellington for 1, you get just half the wellington..It literally took 45 mins to get this dish. The wait was agonizing 'cause my mind just kept thinking about how good it'd be. When the plate finally came my heart was racing. This dish looked exactly like it did on T.V.! Everything was beyond amazing. Pastry crust was flaky, filet inside was roasted to medium rare. All the flavors in one bite blended so well I was so amazed. The potato puree and red wine demi glaze were excellent. The glazed vegetables (parsnips & carrots) accompanying the dish had glaze that were shimmering.. . Demi Roasted Bone Marrow - HUGE bones plated beautifully, decorated w/ green salsa verde. These totally blew away Mastro's bone marrow. I didn't care if my arteries would be clogged, these babies tasted so rich as we scooped the marrow out from the big bones.. . Sticky Toffee Pudding - I noticed every table ordered this and so we had to try it since everyone raved about it & it's their signature dessert. I'm not sure why they call it pudding, when it it really is a date cake. I LOVE the brown butter ice cream, it's cute how they even made it look like a stick of butter. Yaron drizzled the toffee syrup onto the cake and as it flowed spreading throughout the plate I couldn't wait to dig in. The date cake was moist and when you eat the ice cream w/ the cake & toffee, it's an explosion of sweetness in your mouth.. . We didn't finish til after midnight and were the last ones to leave the restaurant (they close at midnight). Midway through our meal, we felt bad staying so late so we told Yaron that he could bring out the dessert when the Wellingtons came out, but he insisted no rush and that we should take our time to enjoy our meal. That is customer service at its finest. We never felt rushed at all, truly an amazing experience at this restaurant. Can't wait to come back! O BTW, I wanted to get a pic w/ Christina, but was notified she has left and is now exec chef at BurGR!
The menu seemed pricey. I was skeptical. Post dinner, the verdict was in - worth it. Most definitely. I don't care for Gordon Ramsay's potty mouth, in fact, it turned me away from him for a long time.. But he has an uncanny ability to take familiar flavours and dishes and execute them perfectly. I had a lamb chop and shepherds pie. But I've never had a shepherds pie like this. And the lamb chop was flawless. And the service was tremendous.. Given my horrible experience at Bouchon a Thomas Keller, you could learn a thing or two
Loved it. Always been a fan of his shows. The food was expensive, but knowing it going in helped ease the pain in the wallet. The food was worth every penny. Had the NY Strip with mashed potato puree which was awesome. I tried the chowder soup and I don't do sea food, but it was awesome. Enjoyed the experience very much. Only negative was sitting on the bench seating where the tables where so close you didn't have a private experience.
My husband and I celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary at Steak.  While we are both fans of Gordon Ramsey, we had high hopes for the service and food.. . It surpassed our expectations.  I am gluten free and the server was very knowledgeable on my choices.  . . My husband at the steak and I had the Ahi Tuna Salad.  We will return for another celebration.  What a wonderful addition to the choices on the Las Vegas Strip.
My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary. Everything we had was unbelievable testy.  I would highly recommend the beef wellington.
My husband and I have been fans of Ramsey for years. One of the highlights of our trip to Vegas was to go to Gordon Ramsey Steak. We knew it would be pricey going in and it was worth every single Penny!! We had the Hell's Kitchen tasting menu and it was truly amazing - we've never had anything even close before. We lucked out and Gordon was there, we managed to shake his hand and get a picture with him. It made our night (Year!).  On top of the great food the service was Outstanding!  Our server was Charles N. and he made the night even better. Great service and conversation without ever trying to hurry along the experience.  We highly recommend going in and we will be back for sure!!
My wife and I both had the HK tasting menu which at first I thought might be a little over priced but I was wrong! Every course was excellent. . Meal consisted of:. Amuse Bouche - Scotch Egg. First course - Beet Root Salad. Second course - Scallop Risotto. Third course - Roasted Beef Wellington. Dessert course - Sticky Toffee Pudding.  . FYI...Still water is not complimentary and you will have to pay for it.
I will go on record to say that the meal I had at Gordon Ramsay Steak was one of THE best meal I have ever had in my life.  I was in awe of the level of service.... Everything was just amazing.  Of course some things weren't exactly my cup of tea (Foie Gras & Pork Belly) but my friends devoured anything I didn't particularly care for.  I guess I'm a meat & potatoes kinda guy, but I'll try anything once. EXCEPT oysters, I will never try oysters!!!!!  . . Upon entering the sexy dining room, you are escorted through a tunnel that whisks you away to London, complete with a Union Jack flag on the ceiling.  The space has pulsating music and a very lively ambiance.  It's not your typical highbrow steakhouse experience.  Hostesses are warm and friendly and the bartenders wereabsolutely amazing and attentive.  My first order of business was ordering a cocktail..... I went with The Drifter. It was delicious and had that kick I needed to loosen me up after a long day at work.  Paris LV proprietary Knob Creek Private Barrel, ginger liquor, falernum, lemon and bitters rounded out this drink and the flavors, or should I say flavours were spot on.  I have no idea what falernum is, so google it!  . . First appetizers ordered were the Sliders....... Brioche Buns were filled with American Waygu Beef, sharp English cheddar and caramelized onions.  The meat was juicy and full of flavor, something that always seems to be lacking when I order sliders.  I thought Todd English's P.U.B. had the best sliders, but Gordon Ramsay just ousted the reigning champ.  . . My friends wanted to be daring, so I went along for the ride. Up next was Smoked Beef Tartare. It was fully cooked, so it wasn't raw... Thank god!  I really loved the lemon zest in the tartare, it gave it a bright citrus flavour. The beef also had red onion, capers, white anchovy aioli and cured egg yolks.  Overall the saltiness from the capers and aioli really complemented the dish.  The Yukon gold herb chips gave the dish the crunch and texture it needed. . . Duck Foie Gras was up next.  I am willing to try anything once, and this was my first time trying Foie Gras.  It was buttery and very rich.  Maybe because I know it's liver, I couldn't wrap my head around eating it.  I did however love the hearts of palm puree, pumpkin waffle and bourbon maple glaze it came alongside. . . Continuing the adventurous theme, Kurobuta Pork Belly was next on our list. I think we ordered every body part from every animal tonight (lol).....  The Pork Belly was flavorful but I'm not a fan of Pork too much.  I prefer a thin crispy slice of Farmer John's bacon vs. pork belly..... I guess my food snobby-ness ends at filet mignon & truffles..... . It was time for another drink and this time I switched it up and ordered a HK Antioxidant. The HK probably refers to Gordon Ramsay's show Hell's Kitchen.  It had Veev acai liquor, lemon and blueberries.  It's like a cleanse for alcoholics. I loved this drink.  Hmmmm, if I had to choose though, I'd pick The Drifter as my favourite cocktail.. . Beef Wellington is approaching table...... Drumroll please..... . DEAD. HEAVEN. Gordon's Beef Wellington has to be one of the best things I have ever eaten.  This dish made my whole night and I will have dreams about it for the rest of my life.  You can order a Wellington for 1 or for 2.  This is an order for 2 and it does take 45 minutes and is served medium-rare. The crust was buttery & crisp. The mushroom duxelle (mushroom & mushroom stems, onions, shallots and herbs sauteed in butter) was rich and the beef was perfectly cooked.  A bite of all three combined with some potato puree and red wine demi-glace, and it's game over.... I don't even know where to go from here..... Hmmmmm.... Sides?. . Ok, sides.... We ordered string beans in a tempura batter that were served alongside an aioli that I could bathe in.  Crispy Brussels Sprouts with an apple cider vinaigrette made them vinegary and delicious.  The Mac & Cheese had blue cheese, cheddar, parmesan and truffle. Can you say decadent? Oh wait, I think I have already...... I'm running out of adjectives to describe this meal..... . This meal by the way is not cheap...... But, if you're in Vegas and you won a couple hundred bucks playing Blackjack or you're celebrating something special..... GO TO GORDON RAMSAY STEAK!!!!!
THE BEST STEAK I HAVE EVER HAD. If you can afford a $100 per person menu then you NEED to go here. Great service and a great atmosphere. The menu is mostly steak obviously but it is by far the best I have had. Cooked perfectly and literally melt in your mouth good. We will definitely be coming back here next time we are on the strip.
Steaks are awesome, but kinda expensive for the serving size. Las Vegas Strip pricing in effect, for sure. Weird red lighting everywhere. Like the uncomfortable red-lit scenes from the 1981 Disney bomb "The Devil and Max Devlin" starring Elliott Gould and Bill Cosby. Surprised that Gordon Ramsay approved of the lighting in here. They say that the color red makes you hungry.... . Cap Of Ribeye ($60) a.k.a. Spinalis steak, is my favorite cut, even more so than Hanger Steak. Both are extremely hard to find, and special orders even at the best independent butcher shops. So maybe it's worth the splurge after all?. . The English Chowder ($18) is pretty terrible. Don't even think of ordering it. Exactly one tiny scallop, one minuscule bit of fish, and 3 halves of a fingerling potato. Boring white chowder with a unnecessarily snazzy presentation - they pour the soup in front of you.. . Bottom line: Gordon Ramsay Steak will do just fine, regardless of the lighting (or the crappy Chowder).
The food was good but pricey.  I had the Bone In Ribeye 24 oz $57.00 served okay. But if you do not like sauce on your steak tell them to serve it on the side. My wife had the American Rib Cap 8 oz, $60.00 really not worth the price. Wine list is extensive but way overpriced. Based on their wine list I have a million dollars of wine in my cellar. Food wise a little above average. Now the downside. There are 2 levels, the main level is very noisy and cramped. The upper level is much nicer except the speakers are above you in the ceiling and the musicwas VERY load. You could not hear each other talk. We mentioned it to our waiter and he said they have a lot of complaints about the loud music. Forget a nice romantic evening, and for this reason I would never go back.
You get what you pay for, so pay $80/oz of Kobe Beef and you'll get BestPieceOfMeatYouWillEverEat/oz
I am a big Gordon Ramsay fan so when I booked my trip to Vegas it was a no brainer that I made reservations for my wife & I to eat dinner here. Though it's costly , it definitely made any & every expectation I had...and then some! Food, Service & Ambiance - second to none !!! Do yourselves a favor & dine here! Gordon Ramsay IS the man!!!
I had dinner there on Feb 23. Awesome experience. Exactly as I expected. From my cocktail (The Side Car), to the Smoked Beef Tartare app, to the Beef Wellington, it was perfection. . . After watching Gordon's various TV programs, you expect perfection and this restaurant delivers. . . Can't wait to go back and try a steak. I had to get the Wellington after seeing it on Hell's Kitchen for so many years.
The food was very good. Loved the Market Green Salad, Wagyu Rib Cap and Potato Puree. The Sticky Toffee Pudding was amazing! The reason I did not give them 5 stars is because the service although attentive was very slow.
What!? I'm shocked that I didn't fall in love with this place. We planned this to be our 'fancy' dinner to celebrate our anniversary. Last time we were in Vegas, we went to Cut and wanted something a little less awkward. Our waiter was amazing and if it weren't for him, I think we would have liked Gordon Ramsay Steak even less. The Beef Wellington was a lot better than the New York Strip (which is what my fiance prefers at steakhouses). You can get much more delicious steak in Dallas for half the price.
I'm a Portland, OR native so I have been to Morton's, Ringside, Ruth's Chris, Portland City Grill, and El Gaucho to name a few. So I figured I had to try this place and Ramsay's acclaimed beef wellington.. . Sadly, it really did not live up to expectations. The service was friendly, but insanely slow even though the area we were seated in was nearly empty. The whole night started off badly when we had to stand and wait for some 5 minutes at the front before anybody even offered to find our reservation or seat us. What was worse was there had to be like 5-6 employees just standing around talking.. . The steaks are definitely tender and cooked exactly as you request. But the steak I received was luke warm at best when I finally got it, what gives? The Beef Wellington, while a nice variety of flavors, just wasn't what I expected. I still prefer a properly cooked steak a la carte.. . The scotch egg was good. The bone marrow, if it is your thing, was also very well done. The sauteed mushrooms had a weird overpowering flavor that I can only relate to "fake bacon" flavoring.. . The sticky toffee dessert was actually quite good, in fact, probably one of the best desserts I have had in my life. If you get anything here, get that.. . All in all, I've had better food preparation, presentation, service, and flavor overall at a variety of other places. The fact that I spent over $250 alone on my meal here makes it entirely not worth it for what you get.. . Sadly, I really cannot recommend this place, other than to try the Beef Wellington and cross it off your list of things to do. Ramsay should really visit this place and shape it up.
This is going to be a very detailed review. If you like details read on:. Arrived at 7 for a 7:15 pm reservation. Seated by 7:10 Music is WAAAAAAY to loud.It is unnecessary in that environment it they turned it down by half it would still be a little too loud. It borders on obnoxious. Service was 85% really good 15% insincere and almost scripted garbage. The physical appearance of the restaurant is nouveau and the place to be vibe. Hostesses ALL need an attitude adjustment. I TOTALLY get famous chef, pretentious reputation hype BS. They are all of that and that is fine. The issue is they are removed from the purpose of their jobs. It is pathetic how they walk people from door to table. It is all attitude that is not restaurant in Vegas attitude but just cold , aloof, don't care yeah yeah yeah in style.. Food:. The food was good / really good with a few real stars in the mix accompanied by some ho hum dishes s well. Caesar salad was one of the best I / we have ever had. It was a work of art on the plate with perfect flavor throughout Dressing was obviously house made and perfect in every way.. Ramsay's Beef Wellington was good but slightly bland. I MIGHT order it again. The Fingerling potatoes were the dud of the night. I think they were running short and just threw frozen potatoes in the fryer and pulled them too soon. They were really hard and flavorless. A real disappointment. The mac and cheese was as good as it gets. Perfect everything with taste from heaven. Sticky Toffee Pudding: It was good but do not listen to the hype about it. Sure it tastes good and served in a fun way but that's it. There certainly are better similar desserts out there. I am not saying it wasn't good I am saying it wasn't the best thing ever put on a plate. Yes it was moist and flavorful yes it had a good taste just no WOW affect.. It isn't cheap $500.00 for 4 with no alcohol but its Vegas and Ramsay.
We ate here 12-25-2012. Just now catching up with all my reviews! This place is fantastic. My daughter son in law and I flew into vegas for xmas and met my dad and step mom here for dinner and it was great. I had the beef wellington which was perfect. Everyone else had some kind of cut of steak and they all loved it. Sorry cant get more specific too much time passing! Service was great too.
