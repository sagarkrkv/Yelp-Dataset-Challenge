As always Hot N Juicy delivers. I have been here only multiple occasions and have always enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. Of course the food is what stands out. Delicious fresh seafood in absolutely amazing sauces varying from mild to spicy for the more adventurous types. . . While I usually go in a group we typically start with two pounds of food and add on as we go. I have had the shrimp extra spicy hot n juicy, lemon pepper. The snow crab legs hot n juicy extra spicy. The lobster (mind you it is served whole) hot n juicy extra spicy. A few sides such as sweet potato fries, the sausage and corn on the cob. . . Yes it is a bit of work while eating to de-shell the food, but to me that's part of experience and I don't mind getting my hands dirty (also ask for gloves if you want). I highly recommend this place to seafood lovers or people who just want to have a fun time with dinner. 5/5. . -Arnold.
the sauce was really great!
I loves me a good seafood boil. Mainly a crab and shrimp boil. I've never eaten a boil at a restaurant but want reserved because this particular place is well known by many. In our boil, king crab legs, whole Dungeness, prawns, potatoes and corn with the sauce that has a mixture of all the sauces. Ooohh yes! Perfect. My one and only issue...not complaint, was I wish they would've took the helmet of of the Dungeness crab. I.could've enjoyed it more
First timers..We really enjoyed our meal of calamari, fried catfish and snow crab legs mild seasoning of garlic butter. Food was served super hot. Come prepared to get messy if you order the crab, served in a plastic bag and comes with a nut cracker,  pick and paper towels. Towelettes served after. :)
Love the shirmp!!! Lol amazing service. Long wait but I think it was worth it. Will stop by again...
This is a great seafood place. If you're in the mood for something special try this place out. I love the sauces here,  but bit much of butter in some of the sauces so be warned.
We came in on Sunday. It was pretty busy as to be expected. However the service was horrible. Not only was my sons food extremely late but a lot of other peoples good was not out quickly. 20 minutes into my drive home I started throwing up and that didn't stop until a few hours later. My husband also got extremely sick. I'd heard great things about this place but after my experience I will not be coming back. So disappointed...
I've been waiting to try this place because my man loves Crawfish... and I love crab.. SO my brother came to town it was 6 adults and 2 kids. It was the busy part of the evening 6:30 but it makes no excuse for the horrible experience I had. 1.. when you have toddlers or babies at the table please offer lids so we don't have to spill the drinks over every where since the table covers move around a lot. 2..we ordered  2 orders of Crawfish 2 shrimp orders and 1 crab. GUESS WHO'S CRAB NEVER CAME... that's right the guy totally looked at us like we were lying and then asked after everyone was done can I bring you some out now... No you fing idiot my whole party is now done and I don't want everyone waiting on me. NEVER GO AGAIN!!!!! FYI if your servers are hurt with a bad shoulder I'm sure he's on pain killers and sucked as a waiter... I was a manager of a fast sit down food place and I would fire you in a sec if you were my employee......
There is nothing fancy about this spot at all, but it doesn't need to be. The food speaks for itself. Definitely try the hot and juicy sauce, crawfish, king crab and mussels. The shrimp didn't have as much flavor as the others. So put on your bib and gloves and go to work!
This is our seafood spot love the food and sauce that hot and juicy seasoning taste so great! Love the hands on of digging into my bag and enjoying down great seafood. Every time we go no matter time of day we never have to wait to be seated! The service in mediocre they care about speed against quality to each customer. Prices are a bit high. They keep your cup filled. Only thing is they forgot to bring gloves had to constantly  ask for some as u watched them bring out immediately to others.
Good service with well seasoned seafood except for the taste less oysters that I don't recommend to anyone who loves oysters.
That Hot N Juicy seasoning, though... ERMAHGERD, I can't get enough. I put it on everything.. . The food is always so good and the staff is super friendly. I went with a group of five last time and we started with a pound per person and added on as needed - it comes out fairly quickly so you're not left waiting too long. ALSO - we had a variety of "spice tolerance" at our table ranging from "I think ketchup is spicy" to "bring the heat, baby!" and everyone ended up happy sharing EVERYTHING. Our waitress was really helpful - and they always are - to make sure everyone got what they wanted (secret - if you want it spicier, get extra sauce on the side!). . Being a desert dweller, seafood is kind of foreign... I always expect it to be super expensive and not be satisfied with the portions. That's not the case here. For what you get, the prices are VERY reasonable and I always have to roll myself on out of there after I've finished gorging.
Wayyy better than boiling crab. Just to start things off. Hot and juicy sauce is the way to go. Must try if you are into seafood. I got a pound of shrimp and snow crab. Well worth it. Believe the hype! . . There was one thing, not that big of a deal but the corn didn't taste fresh and juicy like my experience with boiling crab.
Great food and decent service. The place can get PACKED at peak times. A 45 minute wait is not unheard of. I give this place a slightly higher preference then Boiling Crab. Butter and garlic seasoning is da bomb.
Eat here yesterday for lunch. I had the lemon pepper spicy crawfish and my boo had the catfish basket the food was amazing as usual however we didn't have the best server we asked for gloves 4 times before she brought them. It wasn't that busy. I go only for the food though. I recommend it to anyone who loves seafood and doesn't mind getting messy
Don't charge me $30 for crab legs if you're gonna serve them in a plastic bag. Also, our food took 20 min & the service was pretty slow. Not coming back
Molly was a fantastic server! Never had to ask for anything, always refilled out drinks and made sure we were taken care of! We will definitely be coming back & requesting her as our server!!
I'm from socal, and this is better than boiling crab. The sauce is good, and the girls keep saying I'm hot and juicy I dunno why
Shitty experience. Ok there busy that's ok, ordered food very specifically and it came out wrong, crawfish was good and blue claws were good. Wanted to order more food and was given the check instead. Went to the counter to pay Manager gave me a thumbs up like everything ok said no wanted to order more food and was given a check.. Still hungry... Left beyond dissatisfied, and hungry.
