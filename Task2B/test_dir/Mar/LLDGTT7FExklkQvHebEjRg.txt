Five stars for the food, three stars for the waitress who was efficient but unfriendly. . . Everything a la carte. Ordered the fried oysters for appetizer which was great because they used fresh oysters. My filet mignon was a perfect medium rare and my friend's sea bass was awesome.... But they could lighten on that sweet sauce they use. He scraped most of it off the surface. The sauteed garlic spinach was good.. . I made a reservation, came a bit early so decided to take the first available table in the lounge area. High tables with higher chairs... Should've waited for the main dining area. Anyway I made the reservation on open table via Yelp but they didn't check me in so I received an email about not honoring my reservation. . . Just FYI, make sure they check you in so you get credit on your open table account.
I can eat my weight in crab legs, and love a good steak too.  Four of us ate at Joe's while on vacation recently.  I expected to eat crab legs, but the current market price of $75+ for King Crab was a little more than I expected.  The Surf & Turf combo was cheaper at about $55 and came with King Crab legs & a petite filet, so I chose it.. . The steak was prepared, as requested, a perfect medium rare, tender, juicy, flavorful, and a small dish of Joe's seasoning was served on the side.  Two giant, pre-cracked Alaskan King Crab legs came with it, served with a butter sauce.  Everything was delicious.. . I sampled food from the others in our party, one got exactly the same as me, another got scallops, which were pretty good (I'm very picky about scallops) and my better half got the Parmesan Crusted Grouper which was quite tasty as well.. . We shared an order of Oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer, not the best I've had, but still quite good.. . We also shared an order of the cheesy mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  I wasn't wild about the potatoes, though others in our party liked them.  The potatoes to me were mostly Parmesan cheese with a little bit of potato.  The asparagus was great, but it's pretty hard to screw up grilling asparagus.. . The highlight of our experience was our waiter, I believe his name was Daniel, he was extremely helpful with the menu, descriptions, portion sizes, and drink selection.  Very friendly, there when we needed him, but didn't hover.  Daniel is one of the best waitstaff I've ever experienced.  Thanks Daniel!. . I also experienced a tasty locally brewed ale thanks to Daniel's suggestion, Tenaya Creek Calico Brown Ale.  It was delicious and paired great with the steak.
Order the cucumber martini, even if you're not a gin fan. The flavor converted one of my friends!
We have be coming to Joe's for a few years now. Ever since we have had their king crab legs. It is a must visit when ever we come to Vegas. They crack them and all you have to do is eat them. It's the ultimate in customer service. . . Remember to always make a reservation because they are always busy. You will know why when you come try the place. Excellent food. worth a look.
Nothing to say but excellent food and excellent service. You will not be disappointed
It's hard to pick a place to eat in Vegas, because there are so many options! This one was easy, we wanted seafood and we were walking around The Forum Shop at Caesars. We ended up going with Joe's. . . It was still fairly early at noon for lunch, which I'm sure half the town isn't even awake yet. We didn't have reservations, but there were plenty of tables available. The service was great, our server was fun, personable, attentive and sweet. We asked a bunch of questions about the Stone Crabs, since I've never heard of them. And they were really good at explaining what they were, how they were prepared and even brought out all the different crabs and sizes for us to pick the right order. . . We tried the stone crab, medium size with 7 claws to an order at $39. . http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lJ0pQBaB2fgsDagflH1AGg&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg. . The stone crabs were delicious. Already cracked, easy to peel and dipped in a tangy creamy horseradish sauce. Also from reading the menu, they explained a bit about the crab claws, how they are harvested and then released back in the wild, and apparently the claws grow back. I had no idea. . . We also tried an order of Rockefeller Oysters, which were also very good. . http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=T3GL3566MoyyKhPu0WFvsw&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg. . Main dish was the lobster wrapped in sole. I am a big fan of sole, so I just had to try this one. It was also very tasty, with some wonderful mushrooms and tomatoes on top to garnish. . http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=yfCESqL7zm7byTlE9jUdww&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg. . Along with the fish, we had a small side order of wild mushroom mac n cheese. It was very creamy, but just a tad bland for my taste. . . All in all, the bill came out to about $100 for all the food. I came out stuffed with seafood. And it was a very pleasant meal. No complaints here! I would definitely come back and try more of the meats next time around.
The annual golf and gambling trip....six guys ready to eat and our first time there.  We had great food.  Steaks, scallops and fish were ordered for entrees.  We had the whale, a shell fish app and this was superb.  Sides of asparagus, mushrooms and green beans were great.  Best thing I had was Joe's cole slaw.  WOW!  Marinated in 4 vinegars and a touch of Hellman's mixed at table with tongs.  Everyone raved!!  Peppermint ice cream with hot fudge sauce was outstanding.  All was great and our waiter Neil K. was excellent.  We talked sports....he and I both Bob Huggins UC fans and Cincy sport fans!  Thanks for a great meal!
All I have to say is amazing service, amazing seafood, tasty steaks...it was all AMAZING and EXCELLENT! You won't go wrong eating here. This place was so much better than so many other "steakhouses" I've been to this past year. YUM!. . Oysters. Yum. Joe's stone crab. Yum. T-bone and bone in rib eye steak. Yum. . Well seasoned and cooked as requested and done well. Yum. . . Amazing service from Thomas and everyone else.
The whale app was okay. Wouldn't order it again. Water was too heavily salted, shrimp was tough and stone crab was not the best that you'd expect. Scallop and shrimp ceviche was good! . Petite filet and king crab was outstanding! I'm not even a filet fan and frown on people who order it for its lack of flavor... It was perfect withy the king! Roasted cauliflower with sage brown butter a classic but very good. And the lump crab cakes were the best I've had!
It takes a good 15-20 minutes to navigate through the casino and we had early reservations.   Needless to say we were a few minutes late but guess what?  Even though there were plenty of empty tables we STILL had to wait.   $39 for 7 claws with hardly any meat.   Scallops were lightly fried (this is really just a way to hide that you can't cook scallops right).   The mushroom stuffed spinach was mushy and hard to eat.  The potatoes had hard parts and were overcooked.   We ate at 5 places that were "destination" style places and this was the worst.   . . Finally, "Joe", our waiter, was more interested in serving the table of 20-30 people (even though it wasn't his table) than making sure we had our bottle of wine poured(we got a busser to do it).   Why would I server need to pour our wine?  It was a bottle of white that they didn't keep chilled tableside but instead near the center column 40 feet away from us.. . It was a poor experience.  Find a better fish house.  Mastro's will be our go to next time.
Decent service but good seafood and meat to satisfy your needs. Make reservations so you don't have to wait long to get seated. I made reservations and though I was about 10 mins late, we were still seated right away. Be sure to use the Valet Parking where the Forum shop is near Las Vegas Blvd. Easier to navigate right to Joe's. . . First came the free bread. None are the same and you get 5 different types to try. In my opinion, all were great. The one with sesame I liked the most. We started with a half dozen order of oysters and though the oysters were good, I've had better. We then ordered 7 Stone Crab claws to split with my wife. Great part about this is that they come cracked already and I definitely recommend getting it. Great tasting and fresh, you can't go wrong with this.  For the main, I got their Bone-In Filet Mignon. Priced around $55, this is definitely worth it. Nice huge sized filet mignon that's cooked perfectly and they give you additional steak seasoning on the side if you need it. Bad thing is that the $55 doesn't come with any sides which I don't think any of those do. You will have to order their sides separately. Good thing is that it's a large portion so it isn't too bad if you're sharing. I recommend ordering the mashed potatoes. One of the best I've had and yet it was so good and great serving, we couldn't finish it. Place is a bit expensive but it's worth the price. Service could be a bit better but wasn't too bad. Just that we waited for about 20-30 mins before our main dishes came out. I would probably come back again and try something else on their menu but can't go wrong with the bone-in filet mignon, stone crab claws and mash potato.
My 2nd time here. I recommend their stone crab. This time I ordered 6 blk medium stone crabs $40 again as an order. We asked for it to be steamed and served warm, & with lemon on the side since it was a little bland but tasted fresh!! They pre cracked it for us prior to serving which I thought was nice. We only had to peel the shells off easily. . . They gave us salt and pepper on the side for the stone crab and complimentary bread when first seated. . The bread consisted of parmesan bread, salted pretzel bread, and other crispy wonton looking bread. . . Also ordered the 24 oz. Bone-in Ribeye $60 It was juicy, tender, and flavorful. I asked for medium well. It was delicious. This serves 2 people so I shared this also with an order of the stone crab and an order of mash potatoes.  3 entrees was enough. . . Their Jenny Mash Potatoe's $10 has bits of crispy onion or was it parmesan on top. It was also good. No complains.. . With tax was $118 including 18% tip it was about $138 . Not bad for a dinner date. . My only complaint was the server was on the side talking to her co-worker a couple of times when we needed to get her attention. Also when we asked her opinion for which mash potatoes to order since there is 2 on the menu, she said both of them tasted good. The Lyonnais and the Jenny Mash. Hmm I would expect them to be more helpful. . . Its okay, I would still come back for the great food! . _______________________________________________. . The 1st time I came here, feeding 3 people including me, we had ordered one order of stone crab (6), crab legs. .  An order of "seafood platter" with sea bass, scallops, clams, and baby octopus, it tasted so good. . . And an order for asparagus on the side and salmon with grilled onion mash potatoes.
Amazing! Great food, great service. We had the stone crab which was amazing! I had a filet mignon which was cooked perfectly. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't feel like a nice fine dining atmosphere. Two thumbs up. Get the stone crab!
We always dine at Joe's whenever we are in town. The Alaskan king crab is definitely my favorite as well as their seafood chopped salad. If you aren't a salad person trust me you'll love this one! Since the Alaskan king crab is so good and meaty the stone crabs are whatever.. . The portions are generous and the quality is fresh. A restaurant you must try!
A M A ZING!!! Keith Neighbours is hands down the best server ever
All these Vegas trips and I have not set foot into this place??. . WHY??! Well probably because this was a business trip and no partying was involved in this trip. :P. . Stone crab to die for.. . Service is superb and the waitress was very attentive to our needs.
so good crab fish steak all a+++. Plus I even got a fresh lemon and towel after I ate my crab so I could write this review!!! Amazing
