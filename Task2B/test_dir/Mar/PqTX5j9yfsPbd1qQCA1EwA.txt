To start, I would like to give a shot out to CJ, Josh, and Olivia who made  our night LEGENDARY!. . Having never been to Tao, I was highly surprised with my visit last Saturday. Coming up from the escalator, we witness a line waiting to get into the nightclub and were ready for the wait. However, Josh approach my group (all girls) and asked if we wanted to get in for free (YES!) and stated that there open bar till 11:30pm (awesome!). We waited for about 5 minutes with Josh in a rope off area until his friend walked us threw the club's doors. Then, we proceeded upstairs and noticed to the right was the dance room and to the left was a lounge area.. . Since it was early, we got drinks and hung out in the lounge area. That was when CJ, one the security team, came up to us and asked if we would like to sit down in the table service area. Throughout the night, we took advantage of the open bar and Olivia (our shot girl) for coming back with more shots for us to take! Props to CJ for continue to provide us seating when the tables got bought out. . . The dance floor is SMALL and some may say a little claustrophobic. But the DJ played great music. A mix of old school, hip hop, top 40, and latin music.
Do yourself a favor and skip this place. We got a table, but it was not enough for having excess to the vip area! Come on! Are you kidding me? This is ridiculous! I thought having a table was all you had to do to get some respect. In this place?!? Apparently not. . The crowd is very old, which, was not my thing either. . All in all, this place hit rock bottom.
What kind of night club denies you entrance on a Thursday when its only you 1 person and want you to get table service when its only yourself specially when you are coming out of state that is freaking pathetic okay specially when they say locals its fine makes no freaking sence lame af! avoid go somewhere else on a Thurs. fix your bouncers or yourself as a club #pathetic
Can I give negative stars?...if so Tao would get a negative 2,000. I planned my sister's bachelorette party and could not have had a worse time. I paid for a bottle service and they wouldn't let two of the guests who contributed to the table service in... How is one suppose to have fun when not everyone is allowed in?!? I tried speaking to the "manager"of security and was met with pretentiousness and hostility...please do yourself a favor and do not come here if you want your group to have a good time. Overrated and I will never, ever come back here again.. . Ps. People chain smoke in here, making it impossible to breath in addition to the rudeness you are met with at the door. Awful!!!!
