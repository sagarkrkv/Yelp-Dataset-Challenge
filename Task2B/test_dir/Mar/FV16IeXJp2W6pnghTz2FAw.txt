This place is always packed with good reason. It's pretty amazing. I'd never tried Pho before but fell in love with it. I started ordering the vegan Pho and love that choice better. I don't prefer to eat meat so I like that option. I'm allergic to shrimp but still choose to eat their shrimp spring rolls because they're THAT delicious. The pricing is not bad at all and the service is good. Although it's always busy, the wait is never really outrageous. We go every Sunday as our family brunch and it never fails. Try it. ;)
You cannot come to this place without getting Pho!  My boyfriend always gets #14 with the rare steak and I get #20, the plain pho and add fried tofu.  As for meat, I highly recommend #37 or #38 (depending on whether you like beef or steak).  This meat has an amazing flamed grilled flavor.
This place was fun from start to finish.  It's 3am and the place is packed that's a good sign.  I have to wait for a table only 10 mins or so but the hostess was playful and funny so the time flew by.  Once seated the waitress was at the table and taking drink orders within a min of being seated.  There are a lot of choices on the menu.  The food was yummy and I will be back for sure.  All in all this was a nice change of pace for me and the total experience was fun and friendly.
The go to spot for a meal when you have a hang over after a long night of partying in sin city. Fast service and it's conveniently located right off the strip! Just be careful, super easy to cab there but super difficult to hail a cab back to the Telly.
If you want to wait 30 mins just to place your order, come to this place. Food is great but the service is lacking.
Even though I am Vietnamese, I don't like or crave for pho like some of my fellow Vietnamese peeps. And when I do crave for pho I am extremely picky since most places put way too much MSG. I am not a fan of pho kim long in the bay and I am still not a fan of it in Vegas. The broth to me is very medicore with too much MSG. Meh. We didn't have a chance to look around to see if there are other pho restaurants in the area since we wanted something to eat and then head back to the hotel to catch some ZZZzz.
I think that every time I come to vegas I hit up this Pho joint. I love this place because after a night of getting crazy in the clubs I wake up to find photos of us eating here. Lol The times that I have come here and been sober I've loved the pho. Also we never have to wait longer than 7 min for a table, even when it's 3 am and the place is crawling with drunkards. . . The serving size is good for the price you are paying. I usually get the Pho with beef balls and rare steak (in the soup). Most of the time the servers are quick to get our orders in and we usually get our drinks refilled in a timely manner. . . Love this place!
In our 5 days in Vegas we cabbed out to Chinatown 3 times to eat here..... . We are pretty lucky here in Vancouver to have access to an abundance of Vietnamese restaurants but I was excited to find something in Vegas with the same quality and taste as the restaurants back home.. . It is open 24 hours so one of my visits was after the club - it was busy but we didn't have to wait.. On another night that we went to eat here there was a 20 minute wait but that was around dinner time so that should be expected.. . I had the grilled chicken on rice (loved it!) the chicken was tender and moist and it even had the criss-cross grill marks on it.. On another night I had the beef pho and it was delicious. As with all food in the US it felt a little heavy on the sodium but it wasn't bad like the places that put tons of MSG in their soups for flavour meanwhile inducing days of thirst after consumption.. On the night that we went after the club I had the chicken fried rice and it was really good. Huge portions so we even took the rest to go.. . The location is really convenient because it's on the outside of the plaza facing Spring Mountain Road.
It is a good Vietnamese restaurant.  Can get very busy but almost all the time it is reliable for those seeking a taste of pho.  It is open 24 Hours so I am amazed at how consistent it is.  The name is quite funny.
If someone says this is the best place for pho, you must be on drugs. First, the employees are douche bags. They didn't understand a word I said and gave me the wrong type of pho. And the thing that pissed me off the most is that the cashier expects you to know how much your meal was. If you go up and tell them you don't know, they stand there and tell you to calculate it. And in the customer point of view, THAT IS THE EMPLOYEE'S JOB. Then they just throw out a random number if you don't know what it is. . . Second, the soup to noodle ratio is inefficient. They provide more soup and less noodles. I'd rather pay for more noodles, I mean that's what pho is right, A NOODLE SOUP. I want to get my money's worth. Also, they aren't careful with how they handle their bowls. Since their is too much soup, it spills over the edge. And they don't even clean it up for you. I also tried my cousin's boba, and it was garbage.. . Overall. This was enough to influence my decision that I'm never going here again. The employees need to learn how to do their jobs and learn to have better customer service skills. I do not recommend Pho Kim Long for pho lovers.
Wooooooweee.. Pho Kim Long has quickly become one of my most frequently visited places during a Vegas trip.. . Why is that?. . Convenience? Check. Asian food? Check. Good Asian food? Check. 24-hour good Asian food? DING WE HAVE A WINNER!. . That's right folks. 24 hours of Vietnamese goodness. What better way to ease that hang over or cure that headache with a hearty bowl of food and a side of crispy spring rolls. . . I usually order my Pho Tai (rare beef Pho) or the beef or pork vermicelli/rice plates.. . Reasonable prices paired with good and quick service, you've had me at Pho!. . Lots of parking in the plaza lot, just make sure you drive into the correct one. Everything starts blending together if you are still feeling the night before.
The soup is somewhat bland, giving this place two chances too. The salt & pepper fried squid is actually amazing, I would recommend this over the pho. The tofu nuggets, I prefer this over the fried tofu. The service here is great and friendly though. I dislike how they charge you an extra dollar for leaving the raw meat on the side.
Ate here twice. Always packed!!! Amazing and fast service. Food are great and not pricey either. Will recommend to everyone, especially friends...
Extensive menu.  Food ok but a little greasy but otherwise not bad.  Typical service at a Vietnamese restaurant.
I've gone here soooo much that I've already made myself known as a regular. staff is AWESOME(well the ones I usually deal with are, on occasion I will get that random rude server/busser) and the food is EXCELLENT !!! This is a def must go when coming to Vegas!!
You can expect better quality service at Mcdonalds, this place was awful. we were ignored the entire time, server was rude, manager was EXTREMELY rude & unprofessional. He rolled his eyes and laughed at me while I was talking to him about our service & food.. I used to enjoy coming to this place but I will NEVER be back & make sure to let everyone know they're very unprofessional & treat their customers like shit.
I have been coming to Pho Kim Long for about 7 years now and I'm glad to see it gain popularity over the years.  I recently came here for a quick lunch on what I thought would be a quiet Tuesday afternoon.  I arrived at 2pm and it was jam packed!  They have won some "best of" awards and that has really helped their business.  But with popularity comes the price increases!! Hey, it's a business and they want to make money so I get it.  . . They updated their menu with pricing and graphics, but the dining room is still the same.  . . What I like about this place is that they don't mess around.  You definitely don't come here for the customer service, because at Pho Kim Long customer service is non-existent. You come here for the delicious Pho.  I always get the plain noodle Pho.  For $6, you can't beat the price.  Sodas are $3 though.... Kinda high.  . . They are very fast and efficient and always refill your water without you having to hunt down a waitress.  Food comes out when it comes out, so don't expect them to course it out for you.. . SIDEBAR.....Their egg rolls are also one of my favorite things to get.. . If you're in the mood for some Pho and want a cheap place to go to with friends, come to Pho Kim Long.
Im come here very often at night time, and everything its excellent, BUT in the afternoon....  The service its juts horrible
After a long night, the only place I think of is Pho Kim Long. . The only thing I think of is Pho. . . Its probably that hangover but this place is really good, for the location. My first time having it I thought it would be ok. But it would fix me up before heading back home after a crazy weekend. But besides that this place is 24 hours, their service and food are expedite! Must check it out!
We were visiting Vegas from NYC. I. Never used to think ny had good Vietnamese food until I tried this place. My sister recommended it as we needed to feed our kids something comforting like noodles and rice. . . The pho broth lacked that deep beefy flavor, it was even really light in color. Beef balls were like weird textured mini meatballs. Nothing was outstanding, just mediocre. . . But it must be a popular spot. It was pretty busy.
All the food we ate here was amazing. I love pho and this place has the best pho I've ever had! The service is great and the food comes out fresh and quick. This is definitely one of my top favorite places!
If you are in need of decent, cheap pho and various Vietnamese comfort foods, this place will not disappoint. Though not at the level of places in Westminster or San Jose, I feel the tranquility that only an ethnic foodie dive can offer to escape the strip.. The pho is tasty, the fried rolls are satisfying and the pork chops are seasoned expertly. It's open all hours so spend the money on a cab and get your hungry self over there-it will save you money on that strip club you were considering. Plus a great hangover prevention move.
Awesome Vietnamese restaurant. Wish they have this place replicas in Dallas... . . Everything is really really good. We ordered Vietnamese egg rolls, clam with black bean sauce, Pho beef noodle, Ong Cho garlic vegetable and Bo Luc Lac (cube beef). . . Must go to this place if you are visiting from out of town and want authentic Vietnamese food!
Food is nothing more than ok. Service is horrible. I wish people would stop going there so they can learn their lesson.
Love the Pho here best hangover soup as my friends call it. Be prepared to wait for the table as this place is almost always packed. . . Being vegetarian I very much appreciate that they have vegan pho which is very yummy. Friendly and attentive staff.
horrible service basically told us to get lost.  Their name in Chinese is misleading.
Ive been a pretty faithful client I absolutely love their food. It's always busy so be ready to wait! Servers are pretty nice and so far I've had no problems with my order/food. The bathrooms are always pretty filthy and have a funky smell. BUMMER! .  . Pho? Um yummy! I am definitely a pho lover by far the best pho I've had. Nice and hot when it's served but not to hot which is prefect for me atleast. I always order the taro boba always taste exactly how I remember it an the smoothie is never to watery or too thick. . . Overall I am a pretty satisfied customer, My only issue is the restrooms otherwise I do recommend this restaurant.
I've been to this place probably half a dozen times now. It's the go to spot after a long night out or right before we go back to So Cal. I love the duck noodle soup and the calamari appetizer. The pho is also really good but the menu is so expansive with various Asian favorites, it's hard to just get pho. The service is quick even though it could get packed at times. Seems like both locals and vegas weekenders equally flock to this place. Portions are good and the price is right.
I'm from California and have had lots of good pho... this place is great. The broth taste really good and the noodles are perfect. Great pho for sure. We also ordered the chicken wings and egg rolls... they were just okay, still good through.. . Typically when I'm in Vegas, I only eat at Earls or the big buffets. I love pho for a cheap recovery meal after a long weekend of drinking, and this is the go to place! Great service and I'll definitely be back when I'm in town and feeling like pho. Then I happen to always run into cute girls there lol
