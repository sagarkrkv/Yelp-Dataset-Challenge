Trying Delmonico was a last minute impromptu decision... My friend and I wanted to grab a quick bite before the rest of our friends arrived. We were underdressed/too casual (shorts/tank tops) to sit in the formal dining area so we just shared a steak at the bar. We started off with drinks which were good and strong. I ordered the Lychee martini which was really good, and I couldnt even taste all the alcohol I watched him pour into. We shared a bone in ribeye, medium rare plus. The steak was really juicy and cooked perfectly, but it lacked flavor... We had to ask for salt and pepper. :(  I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come back... Maybe if I stayed at Venetian and needed another quick bite again.
How does one spell grossly overrated...Delmonico's!!! First, I have seen more originality in a Denny's restaurant in terms of decor. This place is as boring to the eye as watching paint dry...that should have been my clue to exit right!!! There is no color, no cool lighting, no cool art, no great looking floors...nope, a two year old could have designed a more interesting restaurant.. . Now let's talk food. It is 3am and I'm on the toilet, let's start there!!! They hand me a steak they claim is prime beef. The only thing prime was the price...52 bucks! The meat was not only tough, but like the decor, it had no taste...NONE. Cosco has better steaks then that thing they brought me. . . So they do take it back a I ordered rack of lamb for, yes, 55 bucks!!! Now those little four rib racks were excellent...but not 55 bucks worth of excellence.  Where's the MEAT! . . Then it is time to go to the bathroom...you won't believe it...a dirty, filthy two stall bathroom!!! And the road to the bathroom, and I purposely used the word road, was a journey in itself. How is it that a place that charges 55 bucks for a rack of lamb can have such a piece of s@&t bathroom? . . And as I sit here on the toilet at 3am all I can tell you is if you think this place is great, then you are from Hoboken NJ because this is a grossly over rated restaurant with horrible food, decor, bathrooms, etc. the owner is laughing to the bank with the fools who go here...AVOID this place. . . The restaurant manage reached out to me...good for them...but I'm not interested.  You get ONE chance to make your reputation, and Mr. Celebrity Chef, you lost it here.  AWFUL PLACE!  GROSSLY OVER PRICED!  DON'T WAIST TIME OR MONEY HERE!
My boyfriend and I dined at Delmonico's on a trip to Vegas  in July 2013 - for dinner on the 4th of July.  The restaurant we had originally planned to go to that night was completely booked, so based on the great Yelp rating we chose Delmonico's instead.  . . Prior to our trip, we were so excited to try this place out.  Our reservations were at 8pm and we showed up a few minutes early, expecting the place to be packed.  I should mention that the location is very odd and not easy to find.  However, once we found it we started wondering if we were  in the right place...  Both of us have dined in nice steakhouses many times and expected that familiar 5 star experience.  From the second we walked in the door it was clear that Delmonico's was not that kind of place.. . The entrance was very dark - no one was at the hostess stand and the bar/lounge area was completely empty.  The restaurant looked closed.   Then, the hostess showed up with another employee - they finished their casual, not work related, conversation before greeting us.  They looked up our reservation and sat us right away so I was ready to let go of my first impression and enjoy a great meal.  Unfortunately, that was just the start.  . . The hostess led us into a mostly empty room with very dim lighting.  We thought it was weird but went along with it.  As we sat down, we realized that the only other table in the room was a large party with serval children - who were playing games and watching movies on their iPads! We were shocked that this behavior was allowed in such a place.  We looked into the other dining room which was mostly full and seemed very lively, full of adults.  When our waiter came over we asked to move to that room (pointing out the distractions at the other table), which they accommodated.. . Finally in the environment we were hoping for, we felt relieved as our new waiter handed us a wine list.  The waiter brought the wine and as he poured the glasses, he spilled an entire glass in front of me, on the table.  Did he find us a new table? Did he bring a new (full) bottle of wine? No. Instead he picked the glass up and continued pouring and brought a white napkin to place in front of me to cover the wine stained/wet area.. . At this point, we considered leaving but it was past 8:30 and we wanted to try the steak, so we stayed.  We ordered the table side Caesar salad and the chateaubriand to split.  The salad was the highlight of the meal - if you go here, make sure to order it.  The steak was ok, slightly undercooked and we have definitely had better.  After the meal, we decided to skip desert here and go upstairs to Otto instead.. . I did use the restroom during the meal.  This was another disappointment.  The restrooms are located down a long hallway, which was also where they stored the extra chairs (stacks of them).  You felt like you were in an area of the restaurant that shouldn't be customer facing - cluttered, scuffs all over the walls and baseboards. . . Overall, the experience at Delmonico's was anything but 5 star.  With so many wonderful restaurants in vegas at this price point, there is no reason to choose Delmonico's.
In my opinion it's not fit for a foodie. Meal was very good but not superb. However, service was great. I wasn't impressed by their BBQ shrimp which was highly recommended as their signature appetizer.  Fish was cooked perfectly but most of the food only had 2 dimensions.  I expected more complexity and excitement in their flavors. Overall great for a cocktail and a good meal but Las Vegas has so many places in this category. I would love a large well known restaurant on the strip to go above and beyond. . . If you aren't adventurous and just want a good meal with all your great basics on the menu this is perfect. It's a crowd pleaser but definitely lacking in excitement. . . If I were to rate the food it would only be 3 stars but the service is very good so I gave them 4 stars. I will be back for drinks but it wouldn't be my first choice for food.
Excellent steakhouse !!! Food amazing !!! Service 5 star !!! Not much to say just must visit and you'll see ;-)
this place hasnt change a bit in their service and the great tasting steaks. every time im in vegas i be sure that is one stop i ALWAYS make...
I ordered. - Bone in rib eye. - Speicial of the day: Lobster and medallion steak. - Lobster bisque. - Twice baked potato. . I could not taste the flavoful and texture of rib eye.. Medallion was very soft and well prepared, but lobster was small and salty.. Lobster bisque was salty.. Potato was just potato.. Bread: disappointed...... . Personally, morton or Mastros are quite better than Delmonico.. . I just want to give 6 or 7 out of 10...
I was very pleased with this restaurant.   . We were celebrating an anniversary and both maitre D and wait staff greeted us with "Happy Anniversary".. The restaurant itself was lovely, comfortable, and busy, but not noisy. We certainly had privacy at our table. . The staff was helpful and considerate. The food was excellent and plentiful. Lots of variety and the staff was respectful of allergies/dietary restrictions. It was pricey, but we spent far less than we anticipated. . My only regret is that we didn't have enough room for one of their fabulous desserts. . I would not hesitate to dine there again.
WOW.. . I came to Vegas searching for their best steak and I think I might have found it.  The dining experience overall was spectacular.  . . I purposely starved myself all day and did tons of walking throughout the day so by the time we were seated at our table, I was ready to rip into it.  The only thing I eyeballed was their bone-in rib eye.  Ordered it medium rare.  The first bite was perfect.  So much flavor and it just melted in my mouth.  Not only was the food great, the service was as well!  . . Thanks Delmonico for making my last night in Vegas dining experience a memorable one!
This is has been on my list for a while, so it was one of my first choices for Spring Restaurant Week this year. I came here for lunch during the week with fellow Yelpers and we took advantage of their $30.14 prie fixe menu (Three Square $4 donation). I also utilized Open Table to make my reservation.. . The three of us started with the Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad for our appetizer. The fresh heirloom tomatoes (2-3 different types/colors) were served with a dollop of creamy Burrata cheese, red onion, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and fresh local basil. Really crisp and refreshing; great start to our meal.. . For the entree, I selected the Delmonico's Prime Hamburger served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, and the usual fixings (lettuce, tomato, onion). It was perfectly medium rare with juices oozing out with every squeeze. The burger had great flavor and seasoning, so that made it stand out from other burgers I've had. It was also an extremely generous portion. I could barely finish half of it (and I eat A LOT). My only complaint was that although the burger started out juicy and delicious, it dried out really quickly and made it almost difficult to eat. I'm not sure what attributed to this, but it was odd. The fries were delicious! A unique preparation of crispiness.. . I also had the opportunity to taste the Butternut Squash Ravioli prepared with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese and Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon served with a sweet corn and crab vinaigrette and fresh basil. Both were really delicious! The salmon was so soft with a succulent rareness in the center of the filet. I was also really impressed with the large chunks of crab meat and whole kernels of corn.. . For dessert, I opted for the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Bread Pudding with Vanilla Bean Creme Anglaise. I'm glad someone else chose Emeril's Banana Cream Pie because it was a tough decision for me (both being my favorite desserts). The bread pudding was moist, warm, and very yummy. The pecan caramel-like sauce was a bit sweet, but fortunately, the pudding was not. The banana cream pie was topped with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Yum. It was good, but I'll have to order one in the future to get a really good taste of it.. . The restaurant is nice and I like the dimly lit rooms with spotlights on each table. It wasn't very busy during our meal, but I'm sure it would still be that nice and quiet. The service was also phenomenal. I was extremely pleased with the offering of Harney & Sons tea (transported in the most gorgeous wooden box display) and the fact that it was complimentary. Everyone was so prompt to refill my pot with hot water and of course, it was served with fresh lemon and honey. We also stayed past their lunch service and they were so kind to allow us to loiter for that long.
Our last night in Vegas & my daughter & I went to Delmonico for dinner.  The service was tops, our waiter Frank was the best!  We had the barbecue shrimp appetizer-excellent!  So tasty and the sauce--so good!  My daughter ordered the NY sirloin and I ordered the lobster bisque.  The steak was superb; like cutting butter and seasoned perfectly.  Unfortunately, I became suddenly ill totally unrelated to the food and had to leave for a bit.  When I returned Frank, our waiter seemed quite concerned and brought me a club soda.  Sadly I wasn't able to eat my meal or have the banana cream pie I had dreamed about sharing with my daughter.  I was not charged for my bisque or the club soda; which I really expected to pay for.  The care and courtesy extended to me was so appreciated!  Emeril should be proud of your employees especially Frank!  Thank you all so much!!!
Everything from the starters to the dessert was amazing. Highly recommended. Only loss of a star was for the restaurant decor. Very boring.
This is the steak house that delivers. Food was prepared to a T and the service was outstanding . Really great time at dinner   There were 4 of us and everyone seemed to have picked the right meal. Really impressive    And did I mention the service??? The name carries itself from new Orleans and this place really carries on the tradition   And they even have the cane root beer from Abita Springs
Holy smokes we loved this place!!. From the homemade potato chips with truffle oil to the BBQ prawns, oysters, herb fillet, halibut, and desert. This place was absolutely delicious. The service was great also. Merill beat Colicchio hands down....
