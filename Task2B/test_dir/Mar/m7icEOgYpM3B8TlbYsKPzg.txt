Open up to your kinky side (if you have any). Definitely not for prudes - stay away from this one! But if you have a sex-positive attitude, sense of humor, appreciate good entertainment and like humorous acts at the border of vulgarity - go for it. 4 stars because it's not as good as "O" or "KA"
I was in the second row on the left side of the stage. I got to smack a fanny, that was fun.. . The show was stunning, the people were beautiful, the nudity was tasteful, VERY funny, and a lot of audience participation.. . Only reason this isn't 5 stars is because there wasn't enough "Cirque du Soleil" in this aptly named show.. . I would go see another "Cirque du Soleil" show and I'd even recommend this one for others with the proviso that this is a cool show but not a lot of acrobatics.
I absolutely love Cirque du Soleil shows but this one didn't really live up to typical Cirque du Soleil shows.. . This 90-minute show is categorized as the "sensual" show, with a lot of nudity (tastful, not raunchy) and sexual content.  There were a lot of audience-performer interactions, which was fun to watch.  The performers were stunning (fit, sexy bodies) but they performed less acrobatic acts, so I wasn't really in awe as I normally am with other Cirque shows.  There honestly was no storyline whatsoever making it more of a variety show.. . Although it was entertaining and pretty lively, I wouldn't (and didn't) pay to see this show.
Ehhhhh I did NOT like this show. Super disappointing for a cirque show. In your typical cirque show you have talented acrobats and amazing trapeze and ribbon work etc. In this show you get sword fighting with dildos, dry humping, and lots of t & a. Yes I'm serious, and I'm by no means a square. I LOVED absinthe down the street at Caesars and that had naughty humor. This humor was just gross and stupid. . . Anyway. This was the strangest show I've ever seen in Vegas. I found myself looking at the time quite often and wondering when it would be over. Wtf with the zip lock Baggie skit? Just not funny. . . There were a few good acts here and there, but overall this was just not my thing.
This show was fun, but I have to admit it was not nearly as risque as I thought it would be per other Yelp reviews. We got MLife cards (which paid off more than once) and got a pretty good deal on tickets. There isn't a bad seat in the house, but I think it's worth it to pay to be on the lower level closer to stage. If you are seeing this show for acrobatics, reconsider. This is not that type of Cirque show. It's a good time, but certainly not as high production as "O" or "Mystere".
Good show.  Very sexual blah blah blah.. . What was funny was the Announcer boy/girl said "where are my gay boys at" and half the theater cheered.  Really?  That many?  Oh well.  The women in the show were nice to look at and our seats were way up top in a corner.  My girlfriend was next to me, but I still felt like a peeping tom being so secluded.  Not a lot of high-flying acrobat stuff, but that's not the type of show it is.  This is a "sensual" show and it is actually very cheap for Cirque.. . I think one of the dudes got naked, but I usually tune that stuff out of my mind so I cannot be sure.  But be ready for it in case I am right.
I really liked this show! The performances were amazing and the comedy and audience interaction was spot-on! I would recommend this show to anyone that is going to Vegas and wants to see something that has an adult theme but also some great acrobatics.
It upsets me to give Cirque du Soleil such a low review.. . No really, it does. Considering I've been to other Cirque du Soleil shows and they were spectacular.. . I guess I was expecting this to be just as breath-taking.. . Maybe I'm jaded? Or as an Australian we see a lot more boobs than normal so realistically, the "adult" content of this show wasn't really "adult" so much as it was just another set of boobs. I mean, I love a great set of boobs as much as the next person... but the adult content was possibly not that adult when the most adult thing I heard was a recording of a woman moaning. . . Simulated dry humping and putting faces close together really isn't my idea of sexy or adult content. Sure the concepts might be adult in nature, ie. Sexualities discussed, etc but honestly? The adult content wasn't even a blip on my radar as far as adult goes.... . Don't get me wrong, the guys will make you giggle and clap with their antics. But the wow factor just isn't there.. . Unless you aren't used to seeing boobs. If that's the case then you might get a wee bit more out of this than I did.
We loved Cirque's "O," "Love," and "Ka," even "Mystere" was OK, and we expected a great show from "Zumanity." What we got, instead, was some very bad, stale comedy, a lot of unattractive women---all of them too fat, or too skinny, and/or flat-chested, not pretty---a couple of 300-pounders in body suits, and oppressively loud and unimaginative music. We walked out after 45 minutes, despite having spent $300+ on two second row seats.. . The men were quite attractive, so maybe women might have a different reaction, although neither my wife nor I appreciated the man-on-man love scenes, the stupid dry-humping or the numerous S & M routines.. . Next time I'm in Las Vegas and want a sexy show, I'll find some burlesque, where at least the women will be attractive.
Best Cirque du Soleil show ever? No, but it was truly enjoyable. I've seen KA, Mystere, and Zarkana, all of these share commonality. Zumanity the edgy side of Cirque is well... that. Unlike other Cirque shows where sitting a little farther back is better, Zumanity is intimate so sitting closer is a plus. Nudity, profanity, sexuality, yes all here. In bad taste? Well that's subjective. Sitting in the front row was an elderly (late 70's/early 80's) couple. I kind of watched them to see their reaction to the various acts and comedy. From what I saw they held hands, laughed, and enjoyed along with everyone else.  . . If you're easily offended or prudish choose another Cirque show otherwise buy a ticket and enjoy the show.. . Tips:. . The stage was small as was the theater itself. The best seats are definitely surrounding the stage. Get a drink before you enter the theater, but ask for it in a cup, yes they let you bring it in.
Continuing with the 2010 theme.... . . I saw Zumanity in 2010, so this review is bit outdated. For a Cirque show, it is 4 stars, not my favorite. But for a Las Vegas Strip show, Zumanity gets 5 stars and definitely worth seeing. . . Some of the acts are spectacular. I thought the ladies in the water bowl were great (half-naked). The lady dressed in bondage wear with the whip and the guy spinning in the wheel, while she cracks the whip.... sexy. Other acrobatic acts, such as the aerial hoola hoop girl was amazing, but wtf... why was she half naked? So yeah... there's a strange juxtaposition on some of the acts, like they were trying too hard to be erotic instead of focusing on their amazing talent. . . I didn't care too much for the MC or the non-acrobatic shows. Some of the characters, like the Satyr, were amazing. But I'm glad they included the BBWs as part of the show because it shows that sensuality comes in many forms and types. . . Which leads me to my conclusion... it was sensual... it wasn't sexy. Some parts were sexy, but during no part of the show did I want to jump my date and hump his leg. Overall, I loved it, but not my favorite Cirque show.
i've been to vegas a million times and have never seen a cirque du soleil show until a couple of days ago. for my first one, i thought this was fabulous! i didnt know what to expect and even thought my bf would think it would be lame, but we were both very surprised to see how entertaining and FUNNY this show is. if anything, it could've been more sexual, or maybe i'm just a huge pervert.  i was pretty smashed during the show, but i had a BLAST. the host/audience interaction was hilarious. theres a little bit of everything for everyone. naked girls, guys, fat chicks, midgets, you name it. excited to see more in the future !!
Save your money! Way better shows in Vegas. I've wanted to this forever and was so excited. I was highly disappointed, I would not recommend it.
This was such a fun show. Definitely risque, but fun. There was so much audience interaction. The strength of the cirque performers never stops amazing me!
