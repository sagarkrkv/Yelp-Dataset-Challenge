This place is awesome, plus the dance floor is spacious and music is great! Local night is on Sunday, but get in line early because the line will be 1 hour or more... My suggestion is to find promoter and get on guest list, which will make your life easier!
Wish to party like a total, crazy Rock Star? Desire to feast your eyes on some beautiful ppl partying in a world-class, upscale club? How about dropping $10k on the Ono cocktail?. . XS has this and more. I promise. Okay, so I'd never drop that kind of money on something you'd pee out 10 minutes later. Even if I DID make millions, I just wouldn't bc of the shear principle.. . I was lucky enough to be w/some folks w/a little cheese and DID get to experience bottle service at our very own table. It did truly rock, I must say.. . This club is so hedonistic, I just love it. Music is on-point and sound system is perfect. I've been here 3 times and I'd go back. Did see Kanye West here in 2010. Not a fan of him as a person but do like some of his music. . . HINT: Get on the guest list - don't wait in line. :)
Okay, I feel compelled to update my review because now that I've gone to Vegas enough, I've decided that XS is my favorite club!. . Why you ask? I know I can always have a good time at XS. I can always count on you, XS, and I wanna thank you for that!. . My most recent experience at XS was when Tommy Trash was there in January! We actually were supposed to go to Light that night but the line was just too ridiculous and we couldn't get in after almost 2 hours of waiting...Thankfully, you saved the day, XS. . . As always, the club looks beaaaautiful from the moment you walk in! I managed to get the very front with some friends and made eye contact with Tommy Trash hehe so that was pretttty cool :) I also loved that the outdoor area was open, though it was January! It's so nice to be able to go out and get some fresh air :) So fun! . . Also, I think there won't be any more issues of XS being overly crowded like what I described in my August 2012 review since Hakkasan and Light are open now.
Massive nightclub with two main stages and multiple bars.  Came here to see Porter Robinson and it was unbelievably crowded, even when we got there around 12am.  It was still a lot of fun, other then the need to move a couple people out of the way.  It also seemed like a great place to come during the day with a massive pool in the middle.
I love this place. The decor is amazing and I love the layout. The DJ booth is up at the front with the dancefloor and the booths are in two levels around the dancefloor in semicircles with the bar on the perimeter. . . The great thing about the music system is that it's super clear and not muddled even though it's so loud. My boyfriend and I went to see What So Not and Salva on consecutive Sunday and Monday nights. Unfortunately I paid in advance but if you use Chris Hornak's service we could have gotten free passes to Salva plus free drinks for ladies until midnight! We loved the music of course and enjoyed rocking out right up next to the DJ booth festival style. Both nights we were there the club was packed and the energy was fantastic. Plus there were two go-go dancers on platforms next to the front. . . If you ever need to rest your feet, you can always sit in the spaces between the booths, where we took a break. And did I mention the bathroom? I don't know about the guys but the ladies restroom is so clean and spacious with lots of mirrors, and has a plethora of body sprays, perfumes and hair sprays available to use plus an attendant. Another great feature is the open air behind the DJ so the club didn't get too hot, cooled by the March night breeze. I wish the pool had been open but I can imagine how sick it must be to party there in the summer. Definitely will be back to hear more great music and party next time we're in Vegas!
I usually love to go to clubs in Vegas. Usually they are comfortable, have a dance floor, and have plenty of heaters outside for people to share. . . Yesterday, my friends and I went to this club to celebrate a few birthdays, including my own. I could tell none of the employees were prepared for the night. I kept seeing people running out heaters for the people who ordered bottle service which almost ran my friend over. . . So not only were my friends and I FREEZING but there was NO dance floor and we were required to keep walking around a pool to "keep us moving" away from the heaters the VIP's were using. . . Although we were the ones being pushed by arrogant men the bouncer still told us to "move along" and did not want to hear us out. . . So after not even an hour of being there my group of 16 friends, pissed, annoyed, and cold decided to leave this "club" if you'd even call it that since it had no dance floor.
This place will RIP you off right from the start. They make you wait and suffer in line and then the "VIP Host" says they will help you out if you pay them an extortion amount of tip per person in your party. Then they tell you that they will only let in 6-8 people per 30 minutes so that you get tired and will want to pay up. This is completely True as they control the line and they are hustling you. They even told my friend that if had to go to the bathroom that it will cost him $20 to get back in line. I hope everyone who had this kind of experience will write about it and hope that a newer club will get more popular than this place. Also, 1-star this place because I think they many fake reviews.  I came here on Friday night, the same day that I am writing this. Actually, I'm writing this in line. XS wants to mess with people in line and extort and hustle money out of people, well, we have a voice and we can teach them to treat people right! They door fee is also $55 and then they try to hustle you for more.
I've been to XS twice now and it just keeps getting worse. This past Saturday made me decided I'm never coming back unless someone is offering free bottle service. I would give one star, but XS gets two because the club is visually pleasing. . . So, Saturday. David Guetta is the DJ and we have guestlist, have to be in before 12am, cool. Not cool is that there are literally three different lines all in different locations for different things and that gets confusing. So, we finally find the correct line and get in. Our guestlist is for outdoor only so we can't go inside, random, but okay. We do have free drink tickets, but the drinks are poured so weakly here it's like drinking juice. The $19 Long Island didn't even do the trick. If you don't like EDM don't come here. Also, the creepiest of guys hang out here.
I've been to XS twice now.. the first time was to see Skrillex a couple years ago which was amazing. This time (On Friday), not soo much. They changed the whole set-up of the club! The DJ was David Guetta.. we got on the guest list but come to find out it was only for the outside with no inside access. It happened to be a tad bit windy and no where to sit oreven dance. There is 3 different lines outside of the club to wait in so everyone is confused. 1 is for VIP, 1 is for guest list and 1 for people who aren't on any list. So if you aren't paying big bucks for a table or outside cabana don't even bother. We stood in line for the only bar outside for 45min, got one drink and then left for Hakkasan to make up for the night.
Going to try and rate this one on the actual venue and not the amazing concert that I went to there. (Deadmau5 and Wolfgang Gartner). The venue is okay. It's a club with a pool. It's not my favorite club in Vegas by any means, but it's not the worst I've been to either. The dance floor is fairly small and gets packed extremely easy when bigger artists come. I'd say the drink prices are "overpriced," but that's obvious when going to any club on the strip, lol. . . The pool was the best part of the club, to be honest, and even then, it's not the best pool club in Las Vegas. It has typical club standards for dress most of the time and it's best to arrive a little earlier, especially if bigger artists are going to be there. Nothing really stood out to me about the place, but I'm not going to avoid it. I think everybody should go there once for the experience. If you like to dance, however, try and find someplace with a bigger floor.
This is rated the #1 club in the USA for a reason.  Top DJs performing, great lighting effects, stiff drinks and all the bartenders looked pretty.  We had no issues getting in and were front stage when Guetta played.  Some of the crowd can be rude - pushing to get closer.But all in all, this place is where you want to be.  Even the bathroom was pristine and had traffic control!  The outdoor pool can get crazy.  People jumping in fully clothed in Armani suits.  This is a place where you can NGAF and let loose.. . Get a promoter or it will be hard to get in.
Went last night on the guestlist and it was such a scam. They only allow you to stay outside and you can't go inside unless you pay. We were told by a promoter that we could just pay and cut the entrance line since we were already technically inside.. . Once we got there, they told us that we had to wait 2-3 hours. The entrance line is long but only artificially. They purposely don't let anyone in until around 12 because they want you to get frustrated with the line. The shark of promoters then circle waiting for you to try and bribe them to bring you up front and they charge whatever they want for that. One guy told us to pay him $100 + entrance fees for one guy and one girl $60. Then another said $140 + $60. Crazy. . . Finally this super sketch guy came up and told us $100 for all entrance and he would walk us up the VIP line. He wanted the money up front but we weren't having it. Waited until he literally walked us in the club with all the stamps then slipped him the $100. . . Omg such a scam!!!! And the other thing is that the party really doesn't go down until 1:30am! David guetta and the epic light shows don't come on til then. . . But I gotta say, when he came on it was freaking worth all the hassle. The place was jumping off the walls insane. The music was good. The show was awesome! I figure it's like paying $50/person for a concert which IMO isn't too bad. . . . Good luck out there. It's a frenzy.
I used to dislike XS because it was too crowded + really bad guy/girl ratio + long lines. But my more recent trip was so much fun and enjoyable that it led me to see XS in a new light. . . If you have an even ratio of girls to guys, get in touch with a promotor and get yourself on a guestlist. Not only is the entrance free, but the wait time is much less. Ladies can get drink tickets that they can use for a certain period of time. . . If you have a party of all girls, you definitely can get inside much faster. You could possibly get a free table!! It happened to me once, but we ended up sharing it with another group. I think it depends on the day and how busy it is. . . The DJ's are great. Music is usually house with a mixture of top 40 / hip hop. It's a pretty big club with nice decor + an outdoor area.
It looks EXACTLY like the pictures, only better. . . OH HOT DAMN! I've been to Vegas twice now and this is by far, the best nightclub I've been to. I came here last Monday night, SOBER, and had a great time. The music is on point, the people are beautiful and the decor is breathtaking. . . Yes, the bouncers can be douche bags, but a little confidence goes a LONG WAY. I walked in like I owned the place (I'm not a bitch, I just refuse to be pushed around), told them I was on the guest list, and walked right in (free of charge! Plus we each got 3 drink tickets). It pays to have ovaries.  . . I was wearing a green boa (it was St. Patty's Day) but they wouldn't let me take it inside the club (apparently it's a weapon?), however they were nice enough to hold it for me and I got it back at the end of the night. . . You know it's a good venue when you have an epic timewithout being inebriated. . PS-Make sure to text Michelle G for guest list and VIP services, she's the best! . 908-770-3570
XS is without a doubt my favorite club in Vegas. A lot of people complain that it is over crowded, dude, every club is over crowded lol.  I don't think XS is small at all. I must agree the dance floor is pretty annoying, drunk people pushing everyone around, it's kind of like a mosh pit. You need to go outside!!!! I love XS because there is so much room outside to dance and dip your toes in the pool.  . . I went last Saturday when Avicii was playing. Let me tell you that it was the best set I've seen at a club!!! The best part is is that he will playing a lot more at XS!! If you are going to Vegas anytime soon you have to see Avicii play! He is truly an amazing artist.  When I was there some people were pushed in the pool, and were able to stay in without getting kicked out.  Everyone else started jumping in the pool soon after. I guess it was like a sunday night swim, only everyone was in their night clubbing clothes.  I can't recommend jumping in the pool when no one is in it, but if you see someone else try and they don't get kicked out then you should definitely go for it!!!
Music bumping. Beautiful people everywhere. Dippin my toes into a pool. Steve Aoki playin. yes I'd say we had an awesome night. $16 for a drink. Very easy to get a drink when you look this hot.
This place was kind of funny, but mostly in a dumb way. Maybe it was just a little too Vegas for my taste.. . We came to see Avicii via a promoter who my friend knew, but since we came on a particularly busy night, we weren't actually going to be able to get inside to the dance floor where Avicii was going to be playing (which we learned after arrival).. . The bartenders here apparently don't like you unless you're a cute girl or a really sexy masculine man, so it took a while to get a drink. I had to really bring out the gay to get their attention, but after I called someone hun, I had my cocktail in a jiffy.. . Our whole group ended up getting into the main room to see Avicii. I'm not saying that the bouncer asked for money in exchange for letting us through. Why would that ever happen in Vegas? All I'm saying is that one moment we were out and the next we were in.. . Once inside the main room, they wouldn't let us onto the actual dance floor, so we had to wait until the bouncer blocking access to the floor was preoccupied with someone else trying to push their way past him, at which point we were able to slip by unnoticed.. . I'm a really determined individual.. . The actual show was a pretty terrible experience. We were packed onto the floor like oranges that are packed together really tightly. The scantily clad dancer next to me kept kicking drinks off of her little stage whenever someone set them down and, inevitably, a number of them went flying toward me. Thanks, lady.. . Avicii came on obnoxiously late. My friends said that this was the longest they had ever waited for anyone at XS. We couldn't leave the dance floor because we wouldn't have been able to get back in... what's the point of being on the dance floor if you can't leave to go get a drink? Avicii came on at 1:45am, by which time we were sober, annoyed, squished, and a little wet and smelly from the alcohol shower courtesy of basically-naked lady (the alcohol wasn't flowing where it counted).. . I felt bad for anybody who spent real money on this, because it was just so terrible, haha.. . We left mid set. It was cool to stay to see Avicii just to be able to say we did, but he came on soooo late and wasn't even impressive when he did come on. People were shoving and being rude and getting in fights. There were a handful of really nice people apologizing for having to shove to squeeze past and whatnot, but most were just aggressive and rude.. . We went somewhere else to get drinks afterward and had a blast.. . This was great for a "Vegas" experience, I guess, but I doubt I'll ever go back. And it's definitely the last time I'm ever wasting a minute on Avicii, haha!
I was really amazed by this night club. It was huge and they have so many VIP booths. The dance floor is a little small but overall the place is huge. They also have a pool outside and pool bar.
I had really high expectations for XS (first time here) but was not that pleased :(. . 4 girls, including myself came here on a Monday night and it was CROWDED. My name was under a promoter's name, therefore did not have to wait in line. We also got 3 free drink tickets for being under the promoter's list. . . When we walked in, it's was so prettyyy! However, as time passed, more and more people came in and became crowded. At that point, there was no place to sit or walk around.. . We went to the bar (there's two) and claimed our free drinks (valid until 12AM) and was too loud to hear what the bartender said. We were not able to claim the drinks we wanted (don't know why), so she made my friends and I all sex on the beaches. . . As for the dance floor, IT IS TINY. People were shoving, spilling drinks and there was NO ROOM to move. (I understand it's a popular nightclub, but the dance floor was just too small.). . There was also a lot security throughout the nightclub, but they PUSH you if you are in the way! I totally understand if it gets crowded and people shouldn't block the way.. BUT COME ON... don't push us tiny girls in super high heels :( My friend was trying to get a drink and was not able to get one because of how crowded the bar was and the fact that I was "In the way" (according to security) while waiting for her.. . Overall, beautiful avenue and will be back to try out this nightclub again but that dance floor is just way too small :(
The club was beautiful, the experience my group had there was unprofessional and disappointing. The sat us at someone else's table, then kicked us out for their mistake. the "club promoter" Camila B. (Mis)represented herself to us, the other group, and the club. She then lied to us to cover her ass, and was nowhere to be found when the drama went down. XS should not have seated and served our party without the person who's name the reservation was under. It was an extremely shady experience and a let down.
Gorgeous place with awesome DJ's. But that is all. Crowded. Expensive to get in and then there is no place to sit. Drinks are expensive. Unless you are doing bottle service you are pushed around like a herded animal. Really disappointed. Dance floor is tiny.
