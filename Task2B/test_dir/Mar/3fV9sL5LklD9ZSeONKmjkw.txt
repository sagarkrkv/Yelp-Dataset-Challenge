Talk about an amazing burger place.  I got the "French Toast Burger" (beef patty between two mammoth French toast slices, topped with maple cream, sausage bacon & a fried egg, and syrup).  It was a monster and I love'd every second of it. . . PRO:. +Epic sized burgers. +Amazing flavors. +Creative specials. . CON:. -None
Weirdest veggie burger ever, also frozen fries for $5 yuck! To top it off $7 for a Bass that's more expensive than Boston!! . . Skip this place!
My experience at BLT was mixed. The burger was good, full of flavor. I ordered fries, they didn't deliver but after seeing the size of the burger decided to pass on the fries. The line to get in moved fairly fast, probably a 20 minute wait. Service was friendly and prompt. The price is in line with Vegas but certainly more than a burger should cost. Caught between 3 and 4 stars, not worthy of 4 due to prices.
Very tasty and price is reasonable. I would defiantly eat there again on my next Vegas vacation
I had dinner at BLT Burger last night before attending the Beatles Love show. We were able to get seats without a wait at 7 pm. Our server was so attentive and friendly. My husband and I both had margaritas to start. Neither one of us was very impressed. I had the interstate 80 burger for dinner. It was completely delicious, and cooked perfectly. The burger had peppercorn crusted bacon, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese and pickles on it. I devoured the entire thing. I also got the waffle fries for a side. They were good but I didn't have room to eat much. My husband really enjoyed his Kobe sliders and onions rings. Our server brought him a side of some kind of awesome ranch to dip them in. I also had the caramel martini and would highly recommend.
I went there with my father after a show in Vegas, i wanted him to try a nice burger, i had a chix burger w avocado and pesto pretty good flavor,our sever could not explain us more about the meat they use or the difference between them  so my dad just got a classic... it was ok. probably be back
This place has one of the best burgers in Las Vegas. We came across it while walking through the Mirage casino and we were looking for something casual. Didn't expect much, just something to kill the hunger. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food.  From the high quality meat to the delicious buns. Hard to beat this delicious burger. Oh and the onion ring are the best. They know how to cook them so that the onion doesn't come out on the first bite. I will be back next week as I drive through Vegas.
I am giving this place a 1 star because the service is very bad.  The waitress took 15 mins to bring our drink orders.  Overall the service was just plain bad.  Food was decent. I would not come back here based on service
I definitely would recommend Blt burger for lunch or a casual dinner. My chicken sandwich was ok but the falafel sandwich was out of this world!  The service is great, the restaurant is clean and prices are decent for Vegas!
My husband and I went to this restaurant last week after going to the Beatles show. My husband ordered the I-80 burger; he ordered his burger well done but it came burned and couldn't really get our server to replace it because he hardly ever showed up to see how the food was and how we were doing. I ordered the California chicken and it was nothing amazing, in fact I couldn't finished it because the sun dried tomatoes were so salty it made it hard to enjoy. We also ordered the sweet potato fries but can't tell you if they were good because we never got them , our server gave us the wrong kind.The only thing that we did enjoy was their buffalo chicken wings, they were really good.As I mentioned before our server never checked on us except for when we were done and ready to pay. I would definitely not recommend it to anyone, unless you want to pay a lot for mediocre food.
I went here twice during my stay and got: the I-80 burger, the lamb burger, the buffalo fries and the sweet potato fries. I liked both burgers but they are very different from each other - so it really depends on what you're in the mood for, but the I-80 burger was "classic" to me - had all the basic components I want in a burger. It was satisfying and delicious, the lamb burger was equally as good but the lamb option and the accompanying sauce gave it a more sophisticated taste (and possibly healthier?) in either event, I thoroughly enjoyed. The sweet potato fries were good, I wasn't a fan of the buffalo fries though, it was too much going on for a side dish. . . One think I wish I tried were the milkshakes - but I discovered there's one in NYC, so I feel like a pit stop there is in my future. . . Overall it's great - and a very good mid-priced option in the Mirage.
Highly overpriced but YUM!  (Will run you about $30/ person for burger/fries/shake) I always make a stop here when I'm in town.  There's a line so get there early.  The Lunch Box shake is money.  Everything is largely portioned so be prepared to eat!. . CON: There is NO gluten free bun option.  WTF?!  At $15+/ burger, come on guys.  Get with it.
Burgers we're good.  Fries were good as well.  I ordered the sweet BBQ wings.  I sent them back, as they were over cooked.  Their server said they looked fine and that was a "normal" look,  They looked and tasted charred.  They recooked an order and they were pretty good.. . I thought it was good, but on the expensive side for a burger.  $11-13, without a side.. . Fries were an additional $5.  Shakes looked delicious.
We ate at BLT Burger in the Mirage last week, and frankly, it was the biggest letdown of our trip.  The restaurant was full at midnight, so we chose to eat at the bar for faster service.  The grill is also located behind the bar, so it was interesting to watch the cooks at work.  The restaurant itself is very cool looking and provides a very nice atmosphere.. . My friend and I both ordered burgers with fries and a shake.  The burgers and shake were good, but not in any kind of life changing way.  We both got sweet potato fries that were, frankly, lackluster.  Neither one of us ordered alcohol, or any beverage aside from water.  Still, our check at the end of the meal exceeded $50 before tip.  . . I understand that on The Strip things tend to be more expensive, and I was completely willing to pay for a great meal.  However, the meal was not great.  It was only okay.  If you find yourself near the Mirage and in need of a burger and shake, you're better of going to In and Out.  Similar quality, vastly more reasonable pricing.
So so burger,good service. I was not impressed w food.
I love this place and love that there is a BLT in Manhattan too!  My sis and I split the Wagyu Truffle Burger which was OUTSTANDING!!!  At $20+ and not including any fries, it ought to be!  The fries and the sweet potato fries were both delicious ... I love fries that are served in paper cones!  My mom had one of the salads with grilled salmon and that was so good too!  My dad had a regular cheeseburger which he also loved.  Not that there was much room for dessert, but we did get a kid sized mocha milkshake with 4 straws, just to taste.  Decadence.
