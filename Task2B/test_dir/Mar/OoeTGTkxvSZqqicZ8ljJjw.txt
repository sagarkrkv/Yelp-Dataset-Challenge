Absolutely hate this club! I've been to Hakkasan twice and it was not a pleasurable experience either time. We waited an hour + in the guestlist line that extended to the outside of the hotel and damn near wrapped around the block. It was seriously like waiting in line at Disneyland. To top it off, people were rude and tried to take cuts. Then once you get inside, it is overcrowded with no breathing room whatsoever. You can barely walk or dance without people bumping into you. There should definitely be a maximum capacity.  They are also really strict.  While in VIP, security kept stopping a girl from dancing on my guy friend. They told me I couldn't smoke my e-cig and that only real cigarettes were allowed.
Hakkasan is better than XS. That's what it comes down to when you're talking Las Vegas bottle service and the industry's best Electronica/Dance DJs.. . MGM did a great job contracting the world's best DJ's like Tiesto, Deadmau5, Calvin Harris etc. They bring the music to a whole new type of space- a multi deck arena!. . We had a table in the Ling-Ling room, forked out $2k for multiple bottles, but price is relevant to the artist and demand. I was disappointed about the music in Ling-Ling as it was not the main stage artist playing. But it all worked out because we could mix up our night by exploring the different rooms.  We were able to mix drinks, wonder down to the arena, and back to Ling-Ling. I would think twice about going without bottle service, it is just the way to do this!. . Keep it classy, Hakkasan! See you next time!
The constant electronic/techno music made me want to shoot myself. There was absolutely no R&B or hip-hop played. The music didn't change all night!
We went Valentines weekend.  I liked the club.  It was nice.  But the night we went they closed the other room that played hip hop.  That meant I had to spend four hours listening to essentially the same song. . .  EDM makes me feel like a crotchety old person.  It's repetitive, formulaic, not interesting.  I think EDM is a major force in driving the drug trade because I'm convinced you literally have to be on something to enjoy that crap.  And to all the people that dance slow and make heart symbols with their hands right before the climax in EVERY song (because they're all same) I know what's up.  And that ain't no one a day vitamins.  At least not the legit kind.  . . I'm also inclined to complain about the fact that you can be parched, drunk and dying for ice water but they make you buy bottled water.  But its Vegas. Expect the ridiculousness of that.  . . Also the stairs are a death trap. A friend of ours missed a step and flew super woman style down a flight of stairs only to be stopped cold by a concrete wall (maybe granite,  it was dark).  After a few drinks I usually point and laugh at stuff like that like a 10 year old.   But witnessing that made me grimace and grateful that wasn't my ass.. . I'll be back but only if the other room is open so I can actually listen to something that makes me wanna shake my booty rather than sigh and lament the music of today.
Why are there so many stairs?. . Other than that, this place is chill.  If you roll with a bunch of girls, they usually comp you a table but only after you send them individual pictures of each girl.   My friends and I came a couple weeks ago and got a table behind the dj and a couple free bottles.  . . We had a pretty good time but geez those stairs will kill you.
Stop and Read This if you are going and aren't getting a table - This place is overrated, overpriced with extremely rude staffers.. . Let me start chronologically...We were going for my best friends bachelor party - 2 girls and 6 guys. 1 of the girls was given a hook up since she worked at MGM and knew some people. We were put on an upgrade guest list that would get us out of lines, comp the ladies and give the guys discounts. This was an absolute hassle and it seemed that every door NAZIwas ruder than the next. No one knew anything and at one point when my friend mentioned she worked at MGM the door douche said, "So?". Eventually we got in at an increased rate. How nice...we were told it was a last minute change.. . So once you get in it's a dizzying maze designed to keep you there whether you want to be or not. And the stairs you've maybe read about - yah... They are everywhere and doesn't seem well thought out for a place that's patrons are getting trashed. . . If you don't have a table, plan on walking around in circles since you are not truly allowed to stand in one place for more than a few minutes. Yes - bouncers will ultimately tell you to move on every ten minutes or so. Likely since they over-pack the crowd well well beyond the 880 capacity plaque you can view as you walk in.. . We were getting tired and just needed to sit a second. Nope! Not happening.. . Attempting to get onto the tiny dance floor is a nightmare and due to the overcrowding, annoying bouncers and drunk douche bags hitting you with elbows, dropping drinks on you and rubbing all over your girlfriends and friends whether they like it or not. Funny how that stuff isn't being managed like NAZIs. . . Oh and just when we were finally fed up with being booty bumped and elbowed and rubbed on for an hour we tried to leave the dance floor - NOPE! Not allowed to leave! Someone - wouldn't say who was coming down the stairs... Who cares? My friend was having a panic attack and needed to leave the hot, overcrowding punch in face-fest ASAP. They were rude and argumentative towards her. There were clearly other ways to get out but they locked us in. Who does this?? How is this professional?! So if I'm dying I got to wait first??? Not good. Experience ruined.. . After 10 minutes are arguing and 5 different bouncers - one let us out the other way. Finally, but clearly much to the anger of the other assholes. God only knows why.. . Once we got out, my friend needed crouch down on the hall floor against the wall and away from crowds to catch breath and calm down. Within no less than a minute another bouncer informed her there was no sitting! Are you kidding me?!?!? . . Needless to say that was it. We left and we'll never come back. I'm sure they don't care since we weren't high rollers, but most people aren't. Most people simply want to see a great DJ and have a good time. This place doesn't allow for that. . . In the end we missed Calvin Harris - night ruined.
Was here on Sat/8 Mar to see Calvin Harris (also ate at their restaurant downstairs which I Yelp rated 5 stars).. . Hakkasan Nightclub. - Big Pros: big name DJs, huge place, different rooms/music options, free seating in the Ling Ling Lounge, cool staff, decent ratio of about 45% women:55% men, their restaurant downstairs.. - Big Cons: no outdoor area (XS, Tryst, Marquee, Chateau...have nice outdoor sections), needs better signage (stairs/the maze didn't bother me but I would like to know I'm walking in the right direction), small dance floor. . - Had a men's $50 pre-sale tix (+ $5 LET (local entertainment tax) + $7.50 service fee so it really came out to total about $63).  A few days before the event the $50 tix were sold out and only the men's pre-sale tix $75 (+ LET + service fee) were available.. - Doors opened at 9:45 so I arrived at the pre-sale tix line about 9:40 pm.  In a quick 10 minutes or so I got my 2 club stamps and entered the club.  I asked a coupla bouncers about re-entry policy and one told me no re-entry that night, another told me no re-entry once the club got full (which would definitely happen with Calvin playing on a Sat).. - Since I didn't want to hassle with Nightclub re-entry I hung out at the restaurant/bar from about 10:15 pm - 12:20 am for dinner & drinks.  I took the elevator from the nightclub to the restaurant/bar.  Restaurant's Ketel One & seltzer was only $12 whereas at the Nightclub a small bottle of Fiji is already $9.  Also they had a special $50.14 menu supporting charity going on and that included a 4-course dinner.. - After dinner/drinks at the restaurant I walked up 2 flights of stairs to the Ling Ling Lounge (free seating with no mandatory bottle service), showed my club stamps to the bouncer to continue on to the Ling Ling Club, then finally got to the Nightclub. . - Since I didn't have the $3,500 minimum for a table and the dancefloor packed, I just stood/danced on the periphery with the other riff-raff for about an hour waiting for Calvin to spin.  At 1:30 am "Feel So Close" came on to signal that Calvin Harris was finally spinning.  I love his music, but except for his own songs I didn't care too much for his set & choice in other songs. . . - Will be back to see Tiesto play.  Will be at XS to see Avicii play and later David Guetta.  Curious how Hakkasan+their star DJs vs XS+their star DJs compares.
I saw Tiesto perform live at Hakkasan a few months ago and had a great experience at this club.  I had no problem getting in despite being with 3 other dudes and 0 females.  However, I made sure to respect their dress code...if you're a dude, you definitely want to go in with slacks (or khakis), long-sleaved collared shirt and most importantly, dress shoes.  Do not try to walk into this place with sneakers or athletic shoes, they simply won't let you in and I don't think they'll "bend" the rules.  Tiesto put on an EPIC performance and the music was just awesome.. . There were plenty of very beautiful young women at Hakkasan on the Friday and Saturday nights when I went.  The ambience and decor of the nightclub is consistent with that of an upscale, exclusive nightclub on the Vegas strip.  This definitely is not a place for drunk, college students to go on a rampage and start humping the nearest doorknob.  All the stumbling, vomiting super-drunk folks will likely get escorted out of the club (forcibly by the bouncers) at the first signs of epic drunkenness (i'm guessing that's when the bile forms in their mouth before the vomiting).  . . The music was great and it's a great setting to meet people if you happen to be single.  Although you'll be trying to talk over the music blaring from the center stage, that would likely be the case at any nightclub, especially the ones on the strip.  There are a few "floors" in the place and there's a lounge-type atmosphere at the tables.  Yes, navigating the stairs can be difficult if you're in a drunken stupor but it's really not a problem if you're sober.  The bathrooms are all on one floor I think.  The drinks are probably overpriced but that's to be expected because (i) this is Vegas and (ii) this is supposed to be one of the nicer nightclubs on the strip.  . . I had a great time at Hakkasan and would gladly go back.  Me and my friends were all able to reserve pre-sale tickets which were way below the prices at the gate.  At the gate, I think dudes were charged $100 whereas my pre-sale tickets were $35 I think.  If you're a dude and you're not with 4--10 attractive young females,  you must (i) purchase the pre-sale tickets before they sell out and (ii) respect the dress code.
I officially hate this place. Here's the short version of my story:. . Came here with 3 other people. Supposedly we were put on the guest list by someone who works there. We were outside waiting for two hours in so many different lines it was ridiculous. They told us to go to the guest list line then by the time we got to the front (which took over an hour) they told us we're not on that list... Then we get sent to the "host guest list" but after talking to at least three different workers we find out it's the same line that we were in. Then we were sent to another long ass line. We wanted to asked the girls working at the front if our names were on there just to make sure it's the correct line before we wait another hour to get in and they said "you have to wait in line for us to check" with SO MUCH ATTITUDE. But we did get in that line for another 30 min and it ended up not being the right line of course. After complaining to a bunch of people on the VIP side, this guy was so annoyed with us that he just let us in.... . Okay, now that we're inside the club... Don't expect to find anyone in there. It's jammed packed. At one point, we were stuck in one section (by the cabana looking tables on the right when you enter) - they didn't let people go towards the entrance or towards the opposite side. So I asked one of the workers where we CAN go so he said up to the second and third floor. But of course it was the VIP sections.... . LONG STORY SHORT: for how big/popular this club is, they really need to be more organized. None of the employees seem to know anything, or at least they didn't know the same things so we were misled every time we had a question. And why do people like this place anyway... They obviously let in WAY too many people. Isn't it a safety hazard...?
My girlfriends chose this club, and from what I've heard it's suppose to be the most poppin' since it's new. Whoever was suppose to get us in for free, f'd up and we ended up having to pay for two girls to get in. Not bad, but still it would've been 100% free if the promoter had actually put our names on the list.. . I believe the first floor was called Ling Ling or something similar to that, and it's suppose to be the hip-hop floor. The music felt a bit throw back, and it was def an older crowd that night.. . My girls wanted to go to the edm floor, which totally isn't my scene. So I had to get drunk enough to really even try to enjoy it.
I got bottom service here for my birthday. The promoter gave us a 2500 minimum quote but when we got to the front a manager approached us rudely and told us we'd have to up our minimum to 3000 or get out. The tab came out to about 4500 after tax, gratuity and some LET fee. . Management and security were very rude. The bottle service girl was very nice and smokin hot. Her name is Lana.. . The club was pretty packed, Calvin Harris was DJing, but overall Hakkasan really needs to work on customer service. . . Light is still my favorite club for EDM by far
dont know what all the hype is about. very underwhelmed with this place. having no place to get some fresh air felt very claustrophobic. felt like a carbon copy of xs but with no outdoor area. and drinks are stupiddddd expensive, sorry ladies.
This is my 2nd review on Hakkasan.  I just feel the need to write another review especially since my views have not changed.  This club is hands down the BEST night club in Vegas!  You can visit this place on any weekend and I can guarantee you won't be disappointed with the DJ that's playing.. . It's definitely nice to know someone who works there to get on the guest list and book tables.  Don't trust any outside sources.. . You simply cannot come to Vegas without experiencing Hakkasan.  Check it out!
Expensive drinks, expensive to get in. It took hours for the dj we came for to even show up. Ended up leaving. Wish I could get a refund but that's never going to happen.
WORST CLUB EVER. I love electronic music and this venue has great DJ's but a horrible sound system. The system could not handle the low or high end that is required for electronic music. If you are not getting a table do not go here. I had  FOUR drinks spilled on me and my drink spilled twice. I paid $30 for my ticket and $50 for my husbands during the presale to see Tiesto on March 15, 2014. They over packed the club. If i called the fire marshal they would have shut the club down. If there was a fire everyone would have died. I did not even stay to see Tiesto due to the overcrowding and lack of view. The wait at the bar was not even worth it for a watered down drink....just to be spilled. . . I WOULD NEVER GO HERE AGAIN AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLUB TO ANYONE.
This place has a few levels to it, which is pretty cool. I feel like this club has more bars in it than others, or at least you get a drink way faster than other places!. . The drinks are pricey, but what do you expect? . . I forgot who I saw the first time I went here, but the last time I came and saw Steve Aoki.  It was pretty cool, the lighting and everything is nice. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the dance floor. It's so much more packed than other big clubs in Vegas. In the beggining I almost left because I was so smashed in the middle of the whole thing. . . Otherwise it's a nice place.
I came to see the legendary Steve Aoki! . They had a promo where if you went to the meet & greet and purchased a T-Shirt for him to sign, you could get free entry into Hakkasan.. . In the club, there are 5 levels of stairs, and we were eventually packed in so tight (and I'm used to that since I'm a regular raver) but this was shoulder to shoulder, butt to nut and i had a hard time getting out. . . The first act was alright, there were too big of gaps in the beat drop, and he seemed like an amateur DJ.. . The headliners ALL start at 1:30AM. . Also, when Steve Aoki came on, he brought out both Tiesto and FlavaFlav for his birthday, so that was insanely epic. I had a great time and hope to catch Hardwell at Hakkasan sometime soon!. . Beware as the only exception for T-shirt wearing is only if you're wearing anything related to the headliner that evening, dress code is enforced! How do people go to an EDM event with Steve Aoki in dress shirts with dress shoes? I still cannot figure it out.
I guess this place has replaced Marquee as the "Go To" club in Vegas... at least thats what my friends say. My friends and I bought tickets online to avoid the endless line. About $75 for a Saturday night with Calvin Harris. . . The place was POPPIN. It got sooooo crowded it became uncomfortable and suffocating. Calvin Harris killed it, but what also killed it was the overcrowding. No space to move. I guess its really "I feel so close to you right now" huh.
It was a fun night but doesn't have the glitz and glamour of other clubs in vegas.
As a local who has been to quite a few of the clubs out here, this one is on my "That's really cool that the DJ's you have are awesome, but totally not worth going to the venue" list. It's like they are compensating for the horrible layout that the club has. The venue is tiny, which sucks because with such big name DJ's like Steve Aoki playing, it's going to get packed...and when it gets packed, which is fairly early in the night, it becomes uncomfortable. . . The help at the front, at least at the time when I went had no idea about the policies on Re-entry. I asked one person, who said you were allowed to re-enter before 11 p.m. and then went to leave, asking one more person to be sure..and that one said there was no re-entry. Welp, that sucks. . . All and all, the DJ list is awesome, but the place isn't worth going to. If you are in Vegas and want to get your dance on, go somewhere else, especially if you don't care who is playing.
fast entry if your on guestlist. ladies free before midnight guys $55 (& that was on a friday night with a promotion) no re-entry!!!!!!  my overall experience was as follows this place is overrated!! wayyyy too crowded and expensive ($9 for a small bottle of figi water) if the water cost that much drinks are more! (i dont drink i was there for afrojack) if you like getting pushed shoved n packed like sardines this is your place to be. i wonder what is their capacity cause there was literally no room to walk let alone dance. beyond unenjoyable not to mention the bouncers and staff act like their shit dont stink and are too cocky for their own good. dont waste your time or spend your $$$ like i did. trust me i was excited to go for the first time being from chicago (the plus afrojack was mixing & he mixed at 1:30 am i got there at 1030 total dragggggg )but like i said save your $$$ hakkasan nightclub sucks dont believe me go n then find yourself shaking your head as your there like wtf yea ... your welcome
Hakkasan always has the best DJs and it's a really nice club. However it is not my favorite club in Vegas for a couple of reasons. One, there is no outside area and it has a type of dungeon feel to it. It's darker than most clubs and not as big as everyone said it would be. I thought it was the biggest club in LV. I would have to disagree with that. Also the drinks are more expensive than most clubs. It was $18 for a mixed drink. I'm not freaking out about it but that's just an FYI to those that like buying drinks in clubs.
Unless I'm going with bottle service with the modelesque bottle girls, this is not the nightclub to be at as a regular patron. Small dance floors that are some of the smallest among the nightclubs on the strip. Sure, the place has 4-5 floors with two of em closed off (one because of $10K bottle service tables). All in all, it is a shade above most of the nightclubs, only because of the DJs that regulate here.
Club Layout - 2 star. DJs - 5 stars. Show - 3 stars . Decor - 3 stars. . . GA EXPERIENCE (Bar crowd) - 1 star . The club has a really bad layout and gets bottled necked in many places. not to mention its very hard to see the DJ/show if you are not on the dance floor. strongly not suggested going if this is you. XS would be the best club for you. . . GA EXPERIENCE (Dance floor crowd) - 4 star . If don't mind being on the dance floor dancing with every one, I've seen them do some pretty cool things with the crowd. but we all know dance floor crowd takes a certain person. . . TABLE EXPERIENCE (DANCE FLOOR & 1ST TIER) - 4 stars . their tables are very nice & spacious, and center to view the DJ/show. if you don't mind spending $3k and higher depending on the night. . . TABLE EXPERIENCE  - 1 stars . If you don't have a Dance floor table or the ones behind it I wouldn't waste money on a table unless you just want your own space. this is because you can't see anything due to all the people standing up on the the dance floor tables. also the club is broken up in many different rooms and if you are not spending a lot you won't be in the main room and in my opinion why would even go to Hakkasan knowing you will be seated in a different room away from the DJ. back in the day it wouldn't have mattered.  . . TABLE EXPERIENCE UPSTAIRS - 4 stars. Upstairs is a pretty cool place. I like that you can see the DJ/show but keep in mind you are away from the main party. . . . In closing Hakkasan has a lot of hyde and you have to see it at least once. but if you're not a super hot chick that can get pulled on onto a good table or are someone that doest mind spending a lot of money i would not suggest it, unless you are just obsessed with seeing a particular DJ. #REALTALK
I am torn between this place but the review is for bottle service only. Came a few weeks back and saw Danny Avila and a group of us got a bottle. First off Danny tore that set up. Second besides Light which is my favorite club in Vegas the table service was premier here. I had table service at all the major clubs now in Vegas which promote EDM and this club is it. Both XS and surrender are cool but they rush you and kick you out. IMO Hakkasan not only have great hosts but the layout for table only is top notch. I will definitely come back for table ONLY as all the other reviews have mentioned the place gets packed and I wouldn't want to be out in the crowd without a table.
MUSIC. Best DJs in the world so I give 5 stars for bringing in the talent!. . VENUE. LIght show was stellar and the dancers made it a very interesting and memorable experience. Unlike some of the other reviews I didn't find it that hard to get around. 5 Stars. . BAR. Expensive but that's Las Vegas for ya! Friendly service always helps soften the blow. 4 Stars. . Enjoy the show and just have fun!
Awfulexperience. Came here for my sister's birthday. Good thing women were free, but damn it would suck to be a guy. My husband ended up paying $125 at the door. First dj was awful & played music that were slow and un-danceable at the beginning. A coke & rum cost a freaking $16 and it wasn't even a tall glass!! Dance floor was too packed and it took me 15 minutes just to leave it. I think several fire codes were violated that night. Main dj (Hardwell) didn't come on until 1:30 pm, at which time it's impossible to even move in the dance floor. Ridiculous prices. Totally not worth it. Hakkasan was a total dud & disappointment. Would not recommend unless you're planning to purchase one of their even more expensive table service.
If it wasn't because my husband and are were able to get in for free and the guys at the line were nice, I would so give this place only 1-star. This place was OVER packed with people!! A total fire hazard! . . There was NO WHERE (like a patio or anything) for people to smoke. Yes, I understand its Vegas and there are smokers everywhere....but come on people...when your dancing like crazy and every deep breath of fresh air I need to take is a big puff of smoke is not a fun environment. At least at XS or Marques, there are outside pool areas for you to get some fresh air and people tend to smoke there (as the stupid smokes get to escape somewhere!) and NOT smoking on the dance floor?! Pretty much, they didn't even need a fog machine because the stupid smoke probably did the job for them.. . I even saw a guy accidentally bumped into a girl while smoking and burned her skin. That is definitely a fight waiting to happen.. . To top it off, there are definitely no where to SIT. I know majority of the clubs are strict with taking off your shoes, no falling asleep etc but many clubs wouldn't care much if you sat on corner of big plant pot, the big speakers etc. These bouncers would literally pull you up before i even sat down.. . Place is way too small, overpriced (if I had to pay) and no outside patio. Will never go back.. . Addendum: Many have raved about the club because of popular DJ lineups and shiny lights, which is true. Although, with a horrible environment, no space to dance except to smell body odor, getting drinks spilled all over you and a cigarette burn I wouldn't care who is there and what shiny lights there are. It would ruined the night someway or another.
went there last Tuesday.  a group of 15. Got there early with our bar and nightclub convention passes. at 9;30 not to crowded. Saw someone fall down the stairs and remarked how dangerous they look. Sure enough an hour later I fell up the stairs. Trying to find someone to report it has been a nightmare. I am very hurt going to DR,today. The black on black floors are a stupid idea I cant imagine anyone with half brain designing a place like that where people drink. And the ones I fell on had no light. I offered to come the next day and show them the said no. Would not go back there. One of my employees a 23 yr old girl got confused from dance floor as others have said and ended up outside of club. They refused to let her in or even help her as all her belongings purse phone and the rest of her party were inside. She was outside alone crying and finally a couple helped her let her use a phone to call one of us. She even asked security to just walk her back to get her things and she would leave and they refused. would not recommend this club to anyone.
Oh Hakkasan... I MISS YOU. My girls and I came here Tuesday, March 25th to see CALVIN HARRIS!!! I was already under a promoter's list but was told to line up with the guestlist line , which was super long :(. . It took about 2 hours to get in, but the best part was that a staff member from Hakkasan asked my group of girls and I to go to the front of the line!!! . . The venue itself? AMAZING. Crowded, but still had places to walk around. They have dancers and nice (kinda cute) security guards there! hehe. . The music that night was the best. I am a huge fan of Calvin Harris, therefore being there that night was awesome! They even throw out foam light sticks to the crowd! :). . EDM, Calvin Harris' own songs, what could be better? One of the best nights I had  and I WILL BE BACK!
I live in Las Vegas. This place sucks. XS all the way. I don't care how good the DJ is and yes, I love Tiesto but I would rather go stick my head in a port-a-potty than go back to this dump. I had more fun in my car, driving away from Hakkasan, than at the club itself. I thought the first time might have been a fluke so I tried multiple times and even the general consensus from all the locals(except the ones that work there) is that they hate it.
