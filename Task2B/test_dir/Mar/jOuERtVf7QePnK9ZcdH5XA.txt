"Relaxed, Comforting Opulence". . The Grand Lux cafe mixes a blend of modernized old world opulence in their atmosphere and decor with comforting casualness of more American dining. The menu is extensive, their dessert display cases tantalizing, and kudos for having many gluten-free dishes available and clearly marked on the menu.. . I have previously visited their other location in Boca Baton, FL and with this branch being in the Venetian hotel and the distractions of Vegas, there was no waiting and were seated immediately (yay!) . . I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh lemonade with sugar rimmed glass (better than their strawberry or raspberry lemonade I have tried in the past.) Thanks to our server Jason for the to-go cup idea for the lemonade that I sipped and enjoyed later during my play time with the slot machines.. . The gltuen-free Bistro steak with the roasted, perfectly seasoned brussel sprout shavings and buttery textured mashed potatoes were excellent and the portion size just right.. . Kudos to the service and staff at this location. No dessert this time but in the past you cannot go wrong with any of their choices.
The food here is good but the wait can get long even after you are seated.. I appreciate that they are open 24 hours and that's about it. . . I've had the chicken and waffles here as well as a club sandwich.  Nothing to write home about --- mostly convenient if you're staying at this hotel, or if you need variety... but are not down for a buffet. . . GLC is a something for everyone type thing with an all day (albeit limited) breakfast menu.
We have eaten here before but this last time was one of the worst experiences ever. Keep in mind it was not busy at this hour. We walked in and were greeted right away and quickly seated. After waiting 10 minutes someone casually dropped off 4 waters  but nothing else. At this point we had waited 15 minutes but still had no idea who our waiter was. We finally asked the lady in the front to be moved into another section and she quickly sat us somewhere else. After that we had to wait another 20 minutes for food and finally ate after what felt like forever. This was an awful experience and the manager came over and just apologized and walked away. He didn't say anything else, didn't ask us if we needed anything. It was  a very disappointing experience especially because we have eaten here many times before. On the bright side the food was good.
I tried to go here for breakfast several times while staying at the Venetian this week but most days there was a line out the door.  This I assumed meant they had the best food/service around which everyone clearly knew about. What I noticed upon further inspection though was that there were over a dozen empty tables and they were simply unable to seat people fast enough to take advantage.. . When I finally did get there for breakfast I had the huevos rancheros.  The flavor was OK, but it was extremely watery.. . The person who took my order wasn't my waitress and when my actual waitress came by she tried to take my order again.  I saw it happen again at another table which could have meant that one lady was poaching tables or the other was a step behind - tough to tell.. . Anyway, the food wasn't bad and the service was pleasant once I was seated.. . I would go back to try something else but there's no way I'd stand in line for 40 minutes to do so.
I typically don't go down to the strip but when I do I at least expect to get high quality food (even if it is overpriced).  I realize this place is just a coffee shop but I never expected they would serve a steak that had been tenderized with papaya enzymes.  seriously gross.  the crab cake was ok but the best part was the remoulade.  also had a chopped salad that wasn't bad but it was over dressed.
Many visits, First time disappointment. . We eat at the Grand Lux at least once, every time we're in Las Vegas, (and we've been to the Grand Lux in Boca Raton several times as well). Pot roast was overcooked and tough. Red cabbage and garlic mashed potatoes (two favorites) are no longer offered. Baby back ribs were a little overcooked, and not especially tasty... also overpriced. They also did not keep up with the corn bread that is part of the ribs dinner... they ran out. Mixed review on the Salisbury Steak. One of our group liked it, and one did not.
The best place to eat late night inlas vegas if you are out late this is the place to eat! I def recommend the shrimp pasta
It's very reminiscent to Cheesecake Factory, as you may have already heard before. It has the same type of cuisine with a variety of dishes that will be sure to please everyone in your group. Just don't expect to be amazed by it. It's a decent option in terms of pricing, but there are so many places to eat in Vegas, I can't imagine ever wanting to come back here. We ate here simply out of convenience and because it was very late.
Good food. Friendly service. Came to the bakery to order to go, ordered the chicken and mushroom soup after their chicken avocado sandwich was a fail. The soup was very creamy and filling. Not bad for $5.
I really enjoyed the chicken Flautas!! They were crispy and delicious!! The bartender was very nice, and served the whole menu at the bar. This was very helpful to me, as I was only able to stand due to an injury. I ordered more appetizers to go bc there were more choices than I could eat! Everything was delicious!!
I have to say, that Vegas has been extremely vegan friendly! :)  This particular restaurant didn't have a separate vegan menu.  The waiter wasn't very informative as to what was vegan, though he tried to make some suggestions.  After scouring the menu, I found something that looked like it would work.  I am so appreciative of the restaurants that go out of their way to make it easier for people that are vegan, gluten-free, vegetarian, nut allergies, etc... Vegas being a destination spot for people from all around the world, I think most of the restaurants are being progressive in offering alternative menus.  I hope that Grand Lux Cafe hops on board! I ended up ordering the Pasta Fresca.  According to the menu it was cooked in olive oil with  eggplant, asparagus, mushrooms and  peppers.  Great flavor!
Always awesome service... Reasonably priced for a Las Vegas strip restaurant... Very clean establishment.... I have always ordered the go to appetizer of Buffalo Chicken Rolls.... Always so good.. I have eaten the Chicken Parmesan, Crab Cakes, Caesars Salad, and Alfredo is amazing...
Wow, this place was a surprise. I have had take-out cheesecakes from here once before, but did not realize what an extensive dinner menu they had. It goes without saying that the deserts are sensational, but the dinner menu is just brilliant. They have two menus - the 'Skinny' menu (appropriately in a skinny format) if you're after healthier options and a regular menu. As others have said - very refreshing to have the option given that there are not a lot of veges involved in most fast food joints (potatoes being the main exception in the guise of fries of course!). We were surprised at the extensive range of things to choose from as well as the really very reasonable pricing. The hard part was trying to decide what to have! I had the fresh-made guacamole and it was hands-down the BEST I've ever had. My gf had Tuscan chicken off the skinny menu and he loved his as well. Servings are generous without being over the top. The atmosphere was great, nice little booths and they seemed to cater really well to families and large groups as well having a glance around us. Bathrooms exceptionally clean. Can't recommend this place enough, would love to eat there again...if only we had one were we live!
casual dining venetian hotel...family type restaurant....reservations recommended...group of nine for lunch...calamari $12.95 and chicken lettuce wrap $10.95 for appetizers...finding enormous mountain for deep fried calamari rings...decent bite to start....lettuce wrap fine and savory chicken heavily marinated/seasoned...taking a combo of shaking beef and caramel chicken $20.50...intense saucing bit too salty and sweet...shaking beef bit too salty....caramel chicken a over sweetened orange chicken type of dish...battered, fried and generously sauced...portions are enormous!...share!...not a single person finishing their plate...enough variety and choices on the menu for anyone...definition of americanized over-sized meals overly sauced salty and sweet...roughly $55 per person gluttonous lunch...
Solid 3/5 stars on food.. Service was 4/5--great, friendly staff. . Apparently this is the "Cheesecake Factory" of Las Vegas.. . First time here, but it is frequented by many of my friends. . . Very extensive menu, so it took us a while to figure out what to order. . . We ordered:. 1) Seared Rare Ahi Tuna Salad: 2.5/5 Eh, good, but obviously not as great as Ahi at a sushi restaurant. . 2) Shrimp Scampi: 3/5 not shabby
This review is just for the side of french fries.  The best french fries East of Balthazar in NYC.
Pros:. - decent, not amazing food. - open 24 hours, thank god! At 4AM, it's a really nice spot to just hang out and grab a bite before turning in for the night.. - great service, frequently hilarious, honest, and so on top everything. - great policy where if you're not happy with your food after tasting it, you can ask to get it switched for something else. They are seriously all about the service.. - huge menu with hundreds of items. There's something for everyone.. - little to no wait to get seated for late night food. . Cons:. - the food takes a little while to come out. - the food is alright for the price. . Overall, I'll probably come back the next time I'm in town and craving late night food.
Good food potato egg rolls are awesome! The customer service was good! Our server was super nice!
The service was excellent.  The food was great as well.   We went there for breakfast and I had to have my second choice egg, sausage, and hash browns.  All were cooked to perfection.  My first choice was French toast but they ran out.  It must have been pretty special to run out on a Monday morning.   I will go back and try to order it next time .
