First review ever! My friends and I decided to come to Marquee to see Cosmic Gate? perform on a Fri night.. . There wasn't really a line to get in b/c we had a promoter so I can't really comment on that minus that everythingwent smoothly for us.. . This review is actually a shout out to a security officer in the women's bathroom named Elsie (not positive about the spelling) for doing an amazing job! She was so wonderful and instrumental in helping us keep our night going!. . The short version of the story is that my friend was pretty drunk and stumbling around so Elsie proceeded to help us take care of her and personally walk her back to our table so we could enjoy the rest of our night. She also periodically checked in on us the rest of the night and performed her job duties with the utmost excellence and professionalism! I'm extremely grateful to her and the ladies that work in the bathroom as well for putting up with our bathroom group pics! I'm sure their job is hard and stressful dealing with drunk people all the time so please be kind and respectful...and be sure to tip them, they really do deserve it!. . Oh and the club was fun too, we had a great time! ;-)
Sob. After my bad experience last time with the SAME THREE FRIENDS, we idiots decided to come again. Why? Because my friend is personal friends with the DJ spinning that night (I don't want to give out details for her and the DJ's privacy, but the DJ is pretty famous and has spun at Ultra and Tomorrowworld). So the DJ got us on his artist guest list and off we went!. . Like last time, the place had HUGE lines that wrapped around everywhere. It was like the fucking Maze of the Minotaur that Hercules had to find his way out of. We flagged down a bouncer, he found our  names on the list and we skipped ahead to the cashier. I will make a point that the bouncers are much nicer than a year ago, so it seems like they are making an effort to change. . . The cashier was a snot. She sniffed when my friend told her we were on the list and said, "no you aren't. It doesn't say so on your paper". My friend "Um, yes it does". The cashier looked down, "oh..." and we were waved ahead. There are elevators now (THANK GOD!!!) and no more climbing six flights of stairs in heels. . . So we wandered around the club not really knowing what the artist's gust list was and tried asking many, many bouncers where we were supposed to be, if we even had a special place to be. No one had a clue. I suggested giving up and just enjoying ourselves. My friend tried one last guy who turned out to be a manager of sorts. Lo and behold, we had FREE BOTTLE SERVICE WHAT WHAT. . . We went to the table (yay!!) and got a drink. Not even ten minutes later, this DJ's manager shows up and states that this is his table. The bouncer/security at the table tells my friend "You've got to leave". And shoves us out. =(. . Now obviously a friend of the DJ's and her silly friends are not as important as the DJ's manager, and at this point I was just happy that I got some free drinks and got to skip the line, but my friends were treated very disrespectfully by the bouncers at the table. I'm not upset that we didn't get to stay. I'm upset because my friend was extremely embarrassed that she was sneered at and dismissed like a piece of dirt. . . Anyway, to be honest, the rest of the night we got over it and we had a good time (The DJ was very good). My friend is semi-famous and mentioned her bad experience to her legion of fans and Marquee sent her an email apologizing and offering her free tickets for next time. And like I said, I did notice the bouncers were more tolerable. No one screamed in my ear and no bouncer pushed me out of their way. Their promoters are always great, Brian T is a good one on Yelp to get on the guest list.
Pool parties and more pool parties! That is all.. . My favorite pool parties in Vegas happened to be in this very place. Sure, I have been to the other popular ones but Marquee Day Club? There's no comparison. And when you get a cabana with your girlfriends? Well, forget about it.. . I've been here with 8 girls, 12 girls, 18 girls and even 21 girls! We've always had a blast. The promoters always get us in without any wait. Gave us an open bar for an hour at times. Sure, lines are out the door but I guess it helps when you have pretty friends? :) Thanks girls!. . There are 2 bars inside and also the waitresses all over. I like the bar on the right when you get in but the bar on far left of the pool is usually better in the summer time. And the cabanas in the pool ? Love love love!. . We've been here on weekends only so I'm not sure how it is on weekdays. But they also play different kind of music on weekends. One time, they were playing emd type songs and the other times were mostly hip hop. It's not like you need a reason to do day drinking in Vegas but when you do, doing it with a great pool party is always a plus. The crowd seems nice most of the time as well. Can't speak for the night time though since I have yet to make it back to this place after we leave the pool parties. But I've seen the crazy lines for it!  Thanks promoters for always getting us in without being part of your crazy lines! :) You guys rock!
Security is terrible. Waited 1h in an empty line and gave large tip to go in
I was dancing with a girl, and this chubby big guy is barging his way through the aisle and nearly shoved my partner pretty hard, so I instinctively block him off and counter-push his weight off. He turns around and I realize he works here, with his staff polo shirt. At this point hes yelling in my face asking if I want to get kicked out of the club for shoving... Wow.
So the 3 stars is based on my experience here over Memorial Day Weekend and Labor Day Weekend.. . I went to Marquee Nightclub for the first time over MDW last year and it was PACKED. I went for my man Kaskade and it gets crazy filled. I got annoyed because the guards kept making us move. Even if you have a table, it gets packed. The outside is awesome though! Just inside is impossible. So Marquee Nightclub over a busy weekend. I say Nay.. . I went back here for the Dayclub for LDW last year and it was AWESOME. Again for Kaskade. I found this promoter Brian T and I wish I had found him sooner. He is the best promoter in vegas! Hands down. He has connects to all the clubs. His only rule is that you only go through him so DO THAT! But anyways, dayclub was amazing. Way better than nightclub. They have the tables too where you can gamble. It gets crazy packed too but I prefer it over nightclub.. . So on Marquee...I would go back for Day but not Night unless it's for Kaskade (since I am obsessed).
I am not too crazy for marquee, but my group did have lots of fun. The dance floor is very crowded, can't barely move. The music was not great, mostly repeated...but I did enjoy the outdoor/pool area which is very refreshing and amazing view...overall it was a great night to party!
I love coming here for day clubbing. I was pleasantly surprised to find the pool to be heated in early March. But come in May this place gets so freaking packed.. . Try the frozen lemonade!
Yet again worst time ever at this club! Who ever thought it was a good idea to put 10 flights of stairs in a club should be shot.  10 to get in 10 to get out.  Done won't ever be back!
As expected, the Marquee was very crowded and lively.  Maybe we were just expecting too much because of what we've heard about the place.  Do you know the feeling when you're expecting something super and it just doesn't happen?  Well, that was our feeling for the Marquee.  . . Since, it did not live up to our sky high expectations that evening....we can only give the place two stars at the most.  The layout wasn't good.  The music wasn't nice.  .  . Can't recommend the place.....I must be getting too old for this kind of thing.  LOL
Wow, Marquee has changed a lot since the last time I was here!!. . There used to be two floors - one with hip hop and the other EDM. But now they have both on the same floor - EDM inside and hip hop outside, which has a similar layout with XS with a pool area, but much bigger.. Interesting. I like this set up better since there is an outside area with room to breathe. . . With an even ratio of guys to girls and after talking to a promoter, we were granted free entry. We almost didn't get in since it was close to the time cut off, but after mentioning our promoter's name, it went smoothly from there.. . If you have a group of friends with varying tastes in music, your group may split up, which happened with us. Nevertheless, I still had a great time catching up with college friends. Always had a great time in Marquee, so definitely coming back!
Went to Marquee a few weeks back.  I had some friends in town so we decided to get a table.  I found a host named Cliff Orr.  He was one of the best I have ever dealt with in LV.  Very receptive and upfront.   Provided all the right information and hooked us up with a great deal and location.  Loved the club!   They had really good music and the crowd was great.  Here is Cliffs cell if you'd ever like to book a table 586-489-4531.
If you don't have a table don't even bother - the security will hassle you, won't let you get close to the dance-floor - you stand in the back like it's 1960's Alabama - i spent all of 30min here (spent an hour at the bar across from it).  Also if you must go there - there is no point to the guest list - you will wait much longer to get in if your on the guest list. BTW, predominantly Asian clientele... gogo dancers... Overall waste of $40 - XS is better - would not return.
Based on my experiences at Marquee, different nights can give you totally different experiences.. . Saturday with Kaskade - Thanks to Noah Ortiz (Host) my girl group was able to get in quickly, no hassle. We got stamps, them left to grab a bite to eat. When we came back 30 minutes later, this place was packed! like every room. I over heard girls from LA complaining and I can see why. Still had fun, but beware that you will br body to body, so try to stand next to a cutie.. . Monday!!! Totally different experience. Plenty of free (well) drinks flowing, actually able to dance on the main floor, and see the beauty of this club. OMG it's so purrrty. Would definitely go back on a non-big name dj weekend or a Monday any time.
This is BY FAR THE WORSE CLUB IN VEGAS!!!!!!!!!!! WE WERE ON THE "VIP" list but apparently that means the wait over an HOUR TO GET IN!!!! They then take us to another line that is apparently shorter but it's the same wait! The bouncer took us upstairs and put us in an even longer line then said it would move faster which was such bull shit. I WILL NEVER BE COMING back here  this place ruined my spring break and I will forever hate this place. If I could give them negative stars I would. The hype is not worth it
This club has some of the best dj's on the planet very upscale and beatiful nightclub awesome for big groups of ppl with there being several different rooms and a big outside area i always have a blast
Security guards are ridiculous, we waited an hour in line just to be told my friend's ID doesn't look like her. We had been in Vegas 3 days and never had a problem! After harassing her for 10 minutes they finally let us in. What's with all the stairs?? Brutal in heels. Porter Robinson and the dancers were great though! . . Be prepared to wait in a long line even if you're on the list!
Came here after XS because it got too crowded. My group of girls and I were under a promoter's list but came here way past the guestlist closing time (ended at 1AM). It didn't take that long to get in though! :). . There was no problem getting past security (I've read other yelp reviews about it). . . The venue was beautiful and the music was awesome. . . Will be back to try out their day club and nightclub again :)

I made a bottle reservation and when I got to the club I had to wait in a line for 45 minutes. And then when I got to the front they refused to honor my reservation and told me I had to pay $1500 for ONE bottle. WTF?!?! They get 1 star for not honoring my reservation. On top of that I had to pay a $75 cover fee. WTF?!?! Good news is I saw some girl's nipple hanging out of her dress. Lol. Once we got in drinks were expensive....which is expected everywhere in Vegas. The place was extremely crowded because it was industry weekend or something. I had a drink spilled on me within 5 minutes of walking in. The music was awesome and the LED stage was cool but when we hit the dance floor we turned right back around because you couldn't even move. The best spot to hang out was outside where there was more space and you could actually breathe. This place attracts the yuppiest of yuppies. I'm sure it gets good reviews bc it's a "high end" club but I never felt smart about getting bottle service and think it's the biggest rip off known to mankind. Never coming back here again...unless they give me some serious comps. Avoid this place...unless you're a douche bag. Then you should fit right in.
What a great club! Pool outside and packed floor inside.. . Tips:. - Stay at the Cosmopolitan for free entrance. - Drink before you go. Drink more after you get there.. - It's crowded. Don't expect any space at all. - Table service is expensive (of course). Do you really need it?. - Check the schedule for special DJs and go early those nights. - Marquee isn't open every night. So plan ahead.. - Plan for lots of walking down metal stairs when exiting. Not cool in heels.. - Don't go alone. The guys get really grabby.. . I love Marquee because the DJs are great and the extras like foam light sticks and confetti from the ceiling make it fun.
Funny how the "hosts" think there sooooo cool and ignore you when u have a table inside.... On industry night when you work in the industry no wonder why Tao group is dying lol...
