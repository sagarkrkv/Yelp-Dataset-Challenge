Easy to navigate. Clean. And lots of food choices. Also has a nice bright waiting area central hub.
great restaurants and fabulous people.  Have to love the Southern Hospitality even from the TSA agents
Dieser Airport ist ein sehr angenehmer Platz, auch sehr sauber und gut Beschildert so das man alles sehr schnell findet. Auch toll sind die vielen Schaukelstuhle in und um das Atrium in denen man schon entspannen kann und dem Treiben im Airport gelassen zu sehen kann. Es gibt genug Restaurants und Shops, so das jeder etwas findet. Durch seine Uberschaubare Groe hat man hier sehr schnell alles im griff. Wir machen hier gerne Zwischenstation.
CLT is my favorite major airport in the US. Am I biased because I work for the City of Charlotte and the City owns/runs CLT??? -Perhaps... but, even when I lived in Savannah (many moons before coming to Charlotte) I would purposefully schedule US Airways flights so that I could be routed throgh CLT rather than ATL. Maybe it's the rocking chairs in the main food court, maybe it's the amazing art glass in the international terminal, or maybe it's the fact that it's a super clean major airport that was well planned and easy to navigate -CLT provides travelers with an excellent first impression of the Queen City.
I've been here before on a layover and this is the first one that I've actually stayed loft a long time. Long layovers suck but thanks to the free wi-fi and the pretty good selection of food available, it makes it time go by faster. Also like that there is guide to speak with at every directory I've looked at to see the location of the food.
This airport has the absolute WORST and SLOWEST security lines in the country, bar none!. . In addition, there is ONE WHOLE SECURITY LINE at the D-GATE for PreCheck only - that has TSA Employees standing around doing NOTHING because the percentage of travelers that have PreCheck is about 1% or less.  Really? ...........Really?. . WTF!  Our Government and the TSA are so out of touch in this location it is just outrageous, period. How come the Charlotte Airport Authority doesn't intervene and explain to the TSA management that this has to improve? . . This is why I absolutely HATE this airport, but I still love the City of Charlotte!. . BTW, The Tampa International Airport TSA do a great job, and are friendly and efficient!
This airport used to be a hidden gem! Easy to fly into, maneuver around, short lines/wait. Now, it's a frickin' zoo. International flights layover here, more people, more construction, longer lines, blahhh!. . It's still better than most airports I've been to, but it is getting up there with traffic similar to major airports.
I can't really say that I thought much of this airport. It has a smoky smell. The main problem is that it is a hub of US Air and in my opinion it is a tossup as to which is the worst airlines, American or US Air. They deserve each other.
Charlotte airport seems to get better and better every time I pass thru.  Security is mmmm... Ok. Allow extra time.  They have a great selection of food in the food court between the B & C concourses.  The sushi bar is wonderful.  I wish the city would take the time to modernize the concourses themselves.  Gate areas and lounges seem to be a little outdated. Starbucks... Galore! The one next to B9 is fast moving and fast paced.  Don't be discouraged of the line is long.  Always buy food before you get on the airplane!
Charlotte is a fairly large airport, and it's one of US Airways largest Hubs.  That being said, it operates fairly efficiently, and I really don't mind connecting here.  I've never been to Charlotte itself so this review is on the connection aspect only.. . Seating:  There is not a whole lot of seating near many of the gates.. . Wifi:  Free!. . Shopping:  There is some.  I've never checked it out, though.. . Decor:  They have a bunch of cute white rocking chairs in the center of the airport near the food court.  There is also a piano.  One time I ran through and there was a whole band.  And once there was karaoke.  I'm not sure if that was organized, though.... . Outlets:  I've never noticed any, but I'm sure there are some somewhere.  Not optimal.. . Food/Drink:  Pretty much anything you could ever want.  Junk food, fast food, sit down, coffee, dessert, booze.  Off hand I can think of TCBY, Jamba Juice, Bojangles, Starbucks, Seattle's best,  and hundreds of other places.  Good haul.  Definitely one of my favorite airports to eat in.. . Cliental:  Most of the people connecting here seem to be on their way to the beach.  That being said, there are so many of the world' SLOWEST walkers.  So annoying when you're trying to make a connection in less than 10 minutes.  I could walk faster than the people standing on the moving walkways.  Giant pet peeve.  The airport needs to post signs or something.. . Gates:  As this is a US Airways hub, don't assume your gates will be close.  The express terminals are located in the E terminal.  B and I believe C now are the large US Airways flights.  I have almost died of a heart attack running from the far end of B to E.  It's not a small feat.. . Moving Walkways:  Many!  But too many slow and lazy people standing and blocking them.. . Try not to laugh every time you realize this airport's code is CLT.  I think it's hysterical.  :)
I was only there for a second in between flight but they could have more charger ports. Its huge!! I had  to go from one terminal to another of course but it felt like it took forever!!! I was glade I had a hour between flights, and if I had only 20minutes.. I would be late. They had a lot of food spots and BBQ of course. It wasnt the greatest bec the WIFI. WIFI makes any airport. It may have been free but you have to sign up for "Offers" to get to it. AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FA DAT. I went to sleep and waited on my flight.
As airports go this one is among my favorites.  Lots of shops, eateries, and an attempt or two to sell local craft beers in "Carolina Beer Co," (terminal D) and "A Taste of Carolina" in Terminal B.  but see my Carolina Beer review.  AVOID ...seriously ...that crappy tequila taqueria place that is about the most boring Mex food I've ever had.  Taco Bell destroys it...nuff said.. . And yes...the rocking chairs and free wifi are charming
Love the layout and size of this airport. So easy to navigate. The central food/shopping area has some nice options and the big white rocking chairs are so southern and inviting. My kids love the moving sidewalks between the terminals. Always happy to fly to Charlotte!
Not bad for a scare port. Plenty of concourse room... rocking chairs, food choices, and clean facilities ... this place will probably earn an extra star after the reconstruction and parking is complete at the main terminal area. The only drawback here is that it's pretty chopped up ... so all of those different concourse areas can be a bit of a walk if you have to change Airlines or are going international and have to change concourses areas due to that.
Terrible parking/access due to an un-phased parking upgrade.  Slow to nonexistent parking shuttles.  The absolute worst baggage handling times.  They do a decent job but come on, you can do better.
I would like to thank who ever is responsible for  planting the beautiful plants at the Look Out Area at Charlotte Douglas Airport.  My husband  and I are avid plane watches ,being surrounded with pretty things makes the day special.. The South Western Plane and the new merged US-AIR/American Air are best in show.
I fly alot and when I fly US air( or the New American ) 70 perent of the time I conenect through Charlotte.So I cannot really comment on the parking and sercurity due to that.Its is the busiest airport in the Carolinas and the 9th or 10th in the nation.Being on a 1 or 2 hour layover is not really a nightmare here.Everything is in walking distance no need to take a train or bus to go to terminal to terminal. . . First the Food options are not bad. Vendors all over the terminals. They have food court in the Central atrium  offering a verity of Asian, BBQ and American fast food. Chills restaurant.And  plenty  seating and rocking chairs( a Carolina thing!!). . Free wifi!! Yea not all airports are doing this so enjoy. There are plenty of power outlets you just have to look behind the chairs. They are hidden yea I am not joking.. There are two airport lounges operated by US air( or the New Amercian) located in terminal b and d. . . Over all great Airport.
