Yelp's statement for 2-star reviews couldn't say it better: "Meh. I've experienced better." . . I'm a Vegas Virgin (Well, WAS anyway) so I really couldn't wait for the Vegas experience! You know, the part where you open your wallet and flush all your money down the toilet? Metaphors, people. . . While my stay wasn't a bad one, there was definitely a lot that could have been done. For instance, the bathrooms seemed like there was minimal work done in there, with dust and a few other things dotted around the bathroom. Second, it felt like the restaurants in the hotel were a little expensive in comparison to the Luxor and Caesar's Palace. . . It was also a rather long walk to East Tower, but I probably need the exercise anyway.  And yes, the not-so-complimentary coffee was kind of an insult. Seriously, $3.50 a cup for something most other hotels do for free? . . If I couldn't find a cheaper/better deal, I'd go here. Otherwise, no.
Customer Service was Very Poor at the Buffet and The security was rude. feel so sorry for my kid and my husband.
Worst stay ever! Wow, where do I begin. I was going to say that our room was decent. That is, until we found animal droppings on the floor and then in our bedsheets!!!! Sad to say this but we were already in the bed when we noticed that something smelled foul. Disgusting! I know this hotel is pet friendly but that means that housecleaning had not changed the sheets!  (GROSS!!!!). . Dinner seating at Benihana was horrible due to a lack of customer service and clearly a language barrier. This is Vegas people!  Learn the language of the land.  Dinner was good but after experiencing the rude hosts, I won't be going back. . . The next day we had lunch at the Burger Bistro. The host was courteous. We sat and our waiter was not interested in introducing us to the menu or how to order from their a la cart menu.  The food tasted good but we had to ask for refills since our waiter didn't come back to check on us. We later saw him, asked for our bill and had settle the bill with the host because he was nowhere to be found. As we were walking out he told us that we were supposed to give him the bill but we simply told him that we were tired of waiting for him to come around. He laughed it off and walked away. We let the restaurant manager know and even she didn't apologize for the lack of service. . . Now if none of this is enough, we decided to leave the hotel at 8pm the night before check out morning (16 hours before checkout time).  We patiently waited in the check out line and no one acknowledged us. Finally, there are 3-4 front desk clerks open and available to help clients, they look at us and continue to chit-chat amongst each other. I finally asked what seemed to be a desk manager overlooking the clerks on the other side of the counter if any of those available clerks had the capability to help us check out. He said yes and finally at that moment a clerk invited to help me at her station since I am openly complaining about the lack of assistance. I tell her I need to check out, give her my room keys and she tries to hit us with a $50 early checkout fee. I had to remind her of the feces-stained sheets and then she waived the early checkout fee. I couldn't believe it! I didn't ask for a discount or comps and this Nasty hotel is still trying to hit me. You would think that I could check out early since it would allow them to clean the room (assuming they clean it at all!) and rent it to the next person. . . I would have to say, the only good service we received was at the valet. Those guys were the only ones that we saw working hard. . . So because of the valet, I stand by the (1) star rating. . . Good luck staying at this hotel!
My wife told me to download the Hotels Tonight app, which gave us a coupon for a hotel stay. We chose LVH. We didn't expect much, but we were pleasantly surprised. The rooms were decent and the bathroom was a nice size. It wasn't huge, but not as small as some places we've stayed either. It's worth checking out if you wanta quick getaway.
First of all, a little context. We go to Vegas about once a month whenever we get bored with LA. That means we always grab last minute hotel deals, and we have stayed in a large number of hotels. Last week we went to Las Vegas for a show, and happened to stay at LVH. We are going again next week for the Supernatural Convention, and we will be at the Bellagio. Now, if I gave both the Bellagio and the LVH 4 stars, does it mean they are equally as nice? Hardly. Like many reviewers already know, you can score LVH at rock bottom prices. At one fifth of the cost of Bellagio, is the LVH only one fifth as nice? I'd say LVH is much better than that. It has the big Las Vegas hotel atmosphere (it used to be a Hilton). Big front entrance, bright and airy foyer, quick access to the check in counters (many large hotels make you grind through the casino area). Check in was quick and painless, although I must say that despite my effort to carry on a pleasant conversation with the clerk, she was all business and no smile. Curt, but not surly. . . The room faced the strip, though at an angle, so you are not staring down the center of the strip. Nice enough view anyway. The size, decor and cleanliness were good enough for a 3 star hotel. Bathroom was clean. While not flawless, it was well maintained. Shower pressure was fine even though it won't give you the tropical downpour experience that I prefer. The toiletries were of near-lux quality as well. The only issue I had with the room was the thin wall. While the entire stay was nice and quiet, in the wee hours of Saturday morning (5am) I was awakened by some couple nearby (next room or upstairs) going at it for 30 minutes. By the sound of it, she was definitely having a good time. You can chalk it up as a bother, but I'd say it was free entertainment.  . . It's about price versus value. For the same cost of a nice dinner you get to stay in a pretty decent hotel, so don't be snotty and say this is not palatial or luxurious enough for you. Having said that, I have to take a star off because, along with many other anxious people, we had to wait 45 minutes for the valet to bring our car. Checkout time on Sunday is tough for all hotel valets in Las Vegas, but I didn't see any hustle from these guys. Tips for future guests: self-park on the night before you check out.
This is the worst hotel in Vegas & maybe the world . We booked a room for four people with four bed .. When we arrived there is just a living room  .. And a kitchen just. . Sooooo baaaaad ..
The worst! The only reason I stayed here because it's convenient to walk to the convention center for the show.. . First it's not clean, the house keepers knock early because they don't provide a do not disturb sign, and they put you in a smoking section and they don't ask if you want it or not and you tell them they wont move you even if your allergic to smoke, . . Would never recommend this hotel!
This is the worst night ever ,I'm at LVH right now in my hotel room and disgusted ... I checked in @ 1130 when I walked in my room I saw the bathroom was not clean and the shower was rusted and stained , I called  the operator hoping that she could help me , but she was rude and had no intention to  help , I MADE A BIGGEST MISTAKE BOOKING ROOM AT THIS HOTEL , I called back hotels.com @ 00:57 and was on phone for 13 minutes they advised someone from the hotel will be  calling me and changing my room , its 1:48 am and I haven't received any call which explains the shitty service they have , NEVER AGAIN WILL BOOK ROOMS FROM HOTEL.COM AND LVH you should shut you facility and fix your dirty, Nasty and disgusting bathroom and change the stinking bed covers .
This was our first time going into the casino. We had a few friends stay here the last time we were in Vegas and they seemed to like it. . The BF and I stopped in after dinner to hit the tables and try our luck. . We didn't know what to expect but had a good time. Place is nice and i felt it was pretty "airy" for being a casino, bright and east to navigate. . We had a good time at the roulette table.. I was pretty surprised learn that they frequently hold "bandas" here. That was a first for me in Vegas, and I've been there more than enough times. . Any who, not sure if we would ever book a room here but we'd come back for some table action.
Customer service is awful. Every person we have encountered here is short with us and downright rude. The rooms are not cleaned very well. Our towels were dirty and the shower is rusted. When walking back to the room last night at 11:30pm with my guy friend we encountered a group of guys shouting and starting to fight and there was no security in sight so we picked up our pace to get out of the area.. .  We booked on hotel tonight and got a cheap deal since we were just doing a quick one night trip we didnt think we would care. We definitely will never come back to this hotel. And plan to notify hotel tonight of our awful and disapointing experience.
It's really not that bad of a hotel in my opinion..... . - Low minimum at the tables. $5 blackjack and Craps.. - Cheap rooms without roaches roaming around, like others.... - Not far off the strip but will require much driving and/or taxi service. - Self-parking requires some walking into the hotel. - Close to the convention center if that's part of your itinerary. - Newly remodeled rooms in parts of the hotel, they give you the option to upgrade when checking in
I was told that internet was free at this hotel.. . When I showed up I found out that there is a $13.99 per night fee for internet service.. . Very disappointed.
The hotel looked really nice... From the outside.. Had to wait in line for 20 minutes to check in, and this was after we had been awake for 30+ hours after driving and setting up at the convention center.. . We get to our room, and it is stiflingly hot. The AC doesn't work. Lovely. We try to open the windows. They don't open, just in case you decide to throw yourself out of them once you realize how bad this hotel is. . . The showers are cold. You are lucky if you get above body temperature. Great for waking up, if you don't want to pay their Starbucks prices for one lousy 12 oz cup of coffee.. . We were on a non-smoking floor, however, which the patrons didn't do. However, the cleaning staff lit up in the elevator area of our floor.. . There were four outlets in the room. One for the TV and coffee maker, but we couldn't actually access it.  Next was the light on the desk, which had a single plug in area. Next was the one next to one of the beds, which was looser than most of the escorts in the area. We awoke most mornings to dead cell phones. The last was in the sink area. But not in the bathroom. . . The rooms are incredibly dark. Probably so you can't see the stains on everything.. . We were facing towards the mountains, so one morning I got to see a beautiful sunrise, but mostly because the curtains were lousy.. . I'm disabled. Having to walk so far to get to my vehicle is beyond inconvenient. It's ridiculous.. . I will never stay at this hotel again. They charge out the nose for everything, including a "resort fee", whatever that is. I think it's just to connect to their lousy wifi. The husband isn't allowed to pick the hotel anymore. Ever.
Resort fee now $18.  Puts the lie to the rates they sell to booking services.  Thoroughly unscrupulous -- shame on both companies.
The absolute worst experience I have ever had for a Las Vegas Hotel.  First we arrived early at 1230 and was told that they had no rooms available for early check-in.  That's understandable and I realized that it was a little early.  We were told that the room should be ready by 3pm.  We finally show back up at 3 and was told that they still had no rooms for us.  Instead they wanted to put us into a handicap room.  We refused and they "found" us another room.  After we walked up and opened the door, lo and behold the room was still dirty and not clean.  We call the front desk and told them about the situation and were given no other choices other than to wait for the maid to clean it.  This is the most in accommodating and unprofessional hotel I have ever stayed at.  After waiting outside the room for an hour the room is finally cleaned and we get to go inside.  I will never stay here again!  Pay the extra cash and don't suffer the headache.
Don't stay here! This place needs some serious work. Filthy carpets and tubs. I regret booking at this hotel.
This hotel should if been torn down with the Stardust, Desert Inn, etc.... . Rooms and hallways smell musty. Water pressure sucks, elevators are slow... Plus a coffee shop in Vegas open from 6am to 2pm...? I've been coming here 38 years and Vegas will never be the same. It was better when it was ran by the mob.
This place was only $18.00 for the one night I stayed here, it is not worth one penny more.. . The wait to check-in was over an hour, on Tuesday, at midnight. The room furnishings were old, out dated and uncomfortable.  The bed was hard and uncomfortable. Service was okay. The air conditioning did not work.  The shower water pressure was low and not hot.  Bathroom linens old and worn out.  Bed linens looked like they have been used since the 1970's.
the only reason I give this a 1 is because I cant give them a zero.  in 30 years of coming to vegas this is by far the MOST DISAPPOINTING EVER !!!!!  and I guarantee they wont care because they are next to the convention center and I say to you.....GO ANYWHERE ELSE.     from the over hour wait to check in with minimum  employees (after a ten hour drive to get there....argh) to the waitress in the casino who would not let me PAY for a drink for some of us waiting AN HOUR TO CHECK IN.........attitude by just about everyone ,to the ..."I'm sorry, we don't have anything more (then our crappy unrenevated rooms) to "what if a tip was included"....."then maybe I could do something for you" which he miraculously got me the ADJOINING ROOM NEXT TO MY FAMILY ---which was not available until a tip and a little shuffling was involved....although I do thank him for the 15 mins of shuffling everyone down a bit )  AND  REMEMBER TO BRING YOUR TOOTH BRUSH cuz it has to be the only hotel in vegas without disposable brushes and 1/2 oz of tooth paste to get you thru the night...................IF it wasn't for my family already being there for a convention)  I WOULD HAVE WALKED TO THE NEAREST HOTEL OR HOUSE AND BEG A COMPLETE STRANGER IF I COULD SLEEP ON THIEr FLOOR   and allow me to add that i paid for wi-fi (really????)  for the sole purpose of YELPING   TO SAVE YOU THE ANGST !!!!!    Your welcome.
Toilet leaked, filthy carpets, had to call for maid service both days we were here, long 45 minute check in. Wonder why Hilton dropped this hotel? Do yourself a favor ang go across the street to Marriott Summerfield suites (?sp) Fail.
I got a great deal on this hotel via Expedia. I didn't have any experience with hotels off the strip so this one seemed well enough for me! I called to reconfirm my reservation after I booked it and the woman who answered the phone was pretty rude. I prepared myself for a rude person when I checked in and was pleasantly surprised by the woman, Michelle, who was perky and kind while checking my friend and I in. Granted, the line was about 50 people long because it was just after 3...and check in starts at 3. I suggest getting there a little early. . . I was able to change my room to two double beds instead of one king bed which was nice. The room itself was clean, the beds were made well and the window had a nice view of the strip. The elevators weren't slow...but if you pressed more than 4 buttons at a time it reset and you had to re-enter them. The AC in our room worked so well, and I'm thankful for that. I can't sleep when it's hot. I was taken aback however by the lack of water pressure. It was hot, but I couldn't even feel the water hitting my head. The outlets were hard to find and difficult to get to, and the only one that worked really well was next to the sink. The other ones were far too loose. The beds were really comfortable though. . . The casino was decent. The paradise cafe has decent food, and the best OJ I've had in a loooooong time. . . Also, the K-Cups in the room MUST work on a sensor. All I did was pick one up to look at it ($3.50 for coffee?! Are you insane? I'll go grab a real latte for that!) and when I went to check out they told me I had used one. Be careful of that upon check out! She reversed the charge for me.. . If I were to stay here again it would have to be through another online deal, I didn't hate this place, but I didn't love it. It gets 4 stars because the room was clean and the staff was nice.
