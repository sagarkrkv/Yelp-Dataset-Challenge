I've been here more than a dozen times, I can't remember a trip to Vegas where we didn't go to the Pepper Mill at least once, if not twice.. . The decor makes me think of a 1970's airport lounge.Its very retro, fun, and casual.. . There is always a wait, if you don't appreciate that, get over yourself and go somewhere else. . . It always seems to be a madhouse and the wait staff is always busy. Be patient. . . I've never felt rushed here, nor have I ever sent my food back for any reason. (but I don't generally do that anyhow.). . The portions are HUGE. (This is my only issue with the place, my sister actually asked them if they could give her a 1/2 portion on a TEN EGG OMELET and she'd pay full price (she just didn't want to waste food) and was told no, they won't cut portions, even if your paying full price.). . I read a bunch of the reviews here before writing mine... Some of the complaints are really unfounded, like "one dimensional" Whats that about? Someone else said "over priced" Are you serious? Apparently we didn't eat at the same place. The food is very reasonably priced and I can't ever finish what I order.. . The only thing I don't like? The Sausage gravy, but that's a personal preference, my guy really likes it.. . The spicy bloody mary's are TO DIE FOR! I recommend going and getting one in the fire side lounge, they taste better when the bartender makes them for you rather than the cocktail waitress ordering them for you en mass. The bartender asks what kind of vodka, and how spicy and if we wanted salt, where as the cocktail waitress just asks if you want it spicy or not.
Wowww, this place is awesome! Comfortable booth seatings and big food portions. Lots of servers and busboys and cocktail waitresses in cocktail dresses. Has a fun diner vibe with neon lights and they don't mess around with their banana splits... It's the real deal. So freaking great.. . They take reservations so if you're on a schedule, probably a good idea because they're often busy and you never know, if there's a big event in town, it'll be even busier. . . There's a gal walking around taking pictures for you to buy. Lol kinda like at Buca de Beppo.
I really don't get the hype over this place.  My wife and I went here for breakfast at about 10am because of the outstanding reviews.  It's typical old-school Vegas gaudy and very crowded. We waited an hour and 20 minutes on a weekday to be seated (now lunch-time) but were looking forward to the food because of the reviews.  They offered us cocktails while we waited (at 10am?  Well, it's Vegas, I guess).. . First, the service was excellent.  The waitress was hustling and she kept up with all of her tables.  She was also very polite and attractive.. . But that was where the good points ended.. .  I got the corned-beef hash because it seemed to be one of the highest rated breakfast dishes.  Where I live, I'm used to corned-beef hash being fresh corned-beef sliced thin and layered over oven-roasted potatoes with sauteed onions and peppers and poached/basted eggs.  I was happily anticipating this sort of dish based on how stellar the reviews were.  Instead, I got a HUGE bowl of what seemed to be Hormel corned beef hash from a can with two basted eggs plopped on top.  Other than the minced potatoes mixed in with the copious amounts of "meat" and 4 slices of fresh (but well refrigerated) green tomato as a garnish, there were absolutely no vegetables.. . I'm no stellar cook, but I would not serve food of this quality (or lack thereof) to guests at my home, let alone try to pass it off as a dish in a restaurant.  I also thought the size was overkill.  I HATE wasting food, particularly meat, but as a normal large (NOT fat) man, I was only able to eat about 1/3 of this dish and still walked away uncomfortably full, and being on a trip was not able to take any home with me (sad).. . I can only surmise that the people who rate this place 4 and 5 stars are:. . a. rating service only.. b. into "all you can eat" style dining.. c. tourists from places with nothing resembling a decent restaurant.. . Sorry, but it was big waste of time and money.  You're much better off finding a greasy-spoon off the strip and eating something tastier, cheaper, and MUCH quicker.
You walk in expecting strippers but there aren't any! Food was okay, nothing to really brag about. LARGE LARGE portions, couldn't finish it. Everyone was happy, and loved the different color sugar shaker. Was this place once a strip club? Remove the tables and you can have private booth dancers...?
Huge portions but so worth the price! The food is so good we ate there 3 times! I suggest you share instead of ordering your own  that's just how much food you get! I will eat here everytime I come to Vegas.
Love this place! Excited I finally found where I will bring all my friends and family for breakfast or late night treat. Large portions / cooked precisely / we had 3 servers, one didn't speak English. The seating is great you don't feel crowded and you feel like you are in your own private place. The servers need to tell the guests "you pay at the front". The bathrooms were discussting, over flooded toilet and stalls out of toilet paper / clearly this area needs more attention, it's dive bar gross.
Was introduced to this place by a friend and we all decided to check it out as a group for brunch. . . Upon stepping into the entrance, slot machines on the left are one of your first sights, very Vegas indeed. The entire environment seemed to emit Vegas-style retroness with fake indoor palm trees, colorful sugar, and a disco-like vibe.. . Since I knew the portions would be huge, my boyfriend and I decided to share a meal. We decided to order the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (that comes with hash browns). In addition, since it was the morning and it looked like every other table ordered some, my boyfriend decided to order a BLOODY MARY to go along with the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. The cocktail waitress was very nice in explaining it to him since he didn't know how it worked. You actually get to choose the type of Vodka you would like in it and they use their own secret list of spices to be included. As for it being brunch time, in Vegas, you would have to be drinking every time of the day. . . My cousin decided to order the PEPPERMILL SAMPLER (golden fried shrimp, breaded chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bruschetta and batter dipped onion rings) for all of us to share. And that was the first thing that came out and man, did we have to share. The entire thing was huge. Sadly, I was only able to try the mozzarella sticks (which were very warm and gooey inside with cheese after being dipped into marinara sauce--yummy!) and an onion ring (I've had better elsewhere). The rest I left to the others in my group to try. . . My boyfriend's BLOODY MARY came out next. Being his first time, it wasn't bad. I tasted it as well and it did taste like V8 with a little bit of Vodka with seasoning in it for better flavor. He actually finished the whole thing and was glad his first time was at Peppermill. . . Finally, our main entree came out, the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (with hashbrowns). It was super crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside and with that gravy on top made it even that much savory. The hashbrowns also had a nice top crunch to it which I love. . . Overall, we came out very stuffed. Luckily, since we shared, we were able to eat all of the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. I wouldn't have been able to if I went into this as a lone person. . . Great first time experience. I can't wait to see what else Vegas has left for me.
Sitting in the fireside lounge is an uncomfortably sexual experience. But If you like the 1970s as much as you like being molested you will love relaxing by the fire pit. . . 3 stars for great servers and huge portions. Minus 2 stars for creepy stains on the furniture.
My friends recommended this location and so we decided to come here on our last day of our vacation.  This place is at the very end of The Strip so we took a cab there.  Its very dark in here.  The menu was big and a little overwhelming as there were so many options.  I ended up getting the Biscuit and Gravy.  The portion is so huge.  The Biscuits were made perfectly as it was moist and soft.    I really enjoyed my meal.  My hubby ordered the Chicken fried steak and eggs with a side of the short stacked pancakes.  He thought it was just okay.  The service here wasn't that great.  We always had to flag our waitress down if we needed something.  Our experience here was so so.
Just like many folks out there, this place is a must stop for me when I am in Vegas. Think about The Peppermill as Denny's on crack  Same prices, same hours but they serve liqour, have muuuuuch better food and the portions are ginormous! I love a place that doesn't hold back on the portions and this place, in true diner style, feeds it patrons like they are at home. I usually go for a giant omelette which comes with a bagel and all the fixings.. . For some reason i always eat here before the drive home, and I always regret it because I'm always in a food coma upon leaving lol.
2/16/14. . this place is always great! ive been coming here for YEARS and its always consistent- good food and lots of it!. . i got the eggs benedict, which is my go to. it was delicious.. . i go to vegas at least twice a year so i cant wait to be back in august.
Best breakfast place in Vegas if you ask me.  Really great food without the absurd vegas pricing.  Yeah its more expensive than shitty dennys but its 10x as good.  The staff is good and decent to look at too.  Egg Benedict FTW.
What is everyone talking about! Nasty stuff fries are soggy.  Baconn was burned and old. Way over priced. Please save your $$ and go somewhere else.
Decor and atmosphere is so attracting, I'm having fun just walking in :) Service is always hit or miss though, especially when they're really packed late at night. You get seated then wait for your food server then along comes a cocktail waitress from the Fireside Lounge. Food has always been great especially with their large portions. If theres a long wait, I suggest moseying on over to the Lounge and have a drink while ya wait :) Peppermills definitely a spot to check out while you're in Vegas even just once.
Great food, large portions, efficient service. Ate breakfast with a group of 8 and had only a short wait. Food was good and coffee kept coming. Later ate dinner, still a short wait, food tasty, service even better.
If you want lots of food, relatively inexpensive with little flavor, this is your restaurant.  Everything from the eggs, hash browns, bacon and pancakes were cooked in the same grease (or lard).   Yuck, very greasy and tasteless.  With everyone's rave reviews we expected al lot better quality.
Best place for casual dining in LV.     Great Breakfast too and open 24/7.   Take a cab here if you have to (next to Encore).   You will still save $ over a hotel cafe.    Food is 1000 Xs better too.   . . I had Philly Cheesesteak and it was the best.    Also had a Buffalo Chk wrap which was also amazing.    Great fries and great service.. . Sit at the counter for some fun watching the whole operation!
I'd wanted to try the Peppermill after seeing the awesome neon in front and staying at the casino in Reno (heh, it rhymes).  We stopped in during mid-afternoon and had the following items:  Oatmeal Cookie blended alcoholic drink (EXCELLENT!), BLT (loaded with bacon--like 6 strips), and chocolate shake (also excellent!).  The interior is all neon, checkerboard tile, and stainless steel.  The pics on the wall of the original building look straight out of Mad Men.  My only complaint is slightly lackadaisical service, especially because we were seated at the counter.  The server was very nice, though, so all is well.  I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in town.
Pretty good food and with large portions. Diet?! Whats that?! You will def be hella full after eating here! . . Friendly staff, but not as attentive as I would expect. I had to keep asking random workers to find our server because they kept forgetting to bring my sides. . . Annnnnd I'm still waiting for Mickey... (See photo reference) lol
Tried the Munch Breakfast which was sauted sausage, onions and bells mixed in their hash brown with eggs and cheese on top.  They saute was not drained, so there was about 1/8th of of a cup of oil in the bottom on the bowl.  This also made the hash soggy.  If they drained the oil out before the mix with the hash and flat topped to keep the hash crispy , it would be better.  Toast, Coffee and Service was good.  Just don't order the Munch.
I came to this restaurant with high hopes based on the 4 star rating it has, but I was so, so disappointed! We had a large group, about 10, and it took a really long time to seat us, even though we seemed to be the only people waiting in the front. They finally sat us down with attitude after about 20 minutes when we complained. Then we were served by the most sassy waitress I've ever had, whose idea of asking for orders was, "What you want?!" After waiting for our food for a good bit we were all served our breakfast...cold. The Munch's Breakfast I ordered was literally thrown down on the table in front of me and was abysmal. The eggs tasted powdered or like they were sitting under a heat lamp for a while. The sausage had gross texture and flavor. Everything about the dish was sub-par, which was particularly annoying when one takes into account how EXPENSIVE the whole meal was. I know things in Vegas aren't cheap, but a simple egg scramble with some veggies and meat for like $14? Come on! For all 10 of us the meal came out to around $225. No one, and I mean no one, at our table enjoyed the dining experience at The Peppermill. The service was rude, the food was terrible and overpriced. My advice to someone looking for some good breakfast: go anywhere else. Hell, drive out to Primm and eat at a gas station- it'll be half the price and just as good.
What a great place to bring friends or family. We brought our kids there, we all just loved it. We went around 12 o'clock in the afternoon had a late lunch and the service was great even though it was packed to the rim. Unfortunately we didn't get to hang out in the lounge, but were able to see it and wow what a cool place. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is absolutely unique and such a fun place.
This is a must do for old school Vegas fans.  Its 70s mirror laden walls with neon lights somehow work here.  Love the trees that hang over the booths.  Make sure you check out the lounge as well... I can picture Ace Rothstein still sitting in there.   As for the food, it's fresh, tasty, simple yet not elementary.  I had the chicken fried steak and eggs...amazing! Service is great and portions are huge.  Peppermill is my new go to for brunch in Vegas!
