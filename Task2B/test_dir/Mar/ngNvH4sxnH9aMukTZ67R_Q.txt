Great food. Good service. I wouldve given this place 5 stars but they didnt have pickles. Lots of booze though. Good times. Another strange thing was they have a photographer ready to take your picture as u enter, why would anyone want a professional picture done at a buffet? Calm down Vegas, u are already getting all of my money.
Not 50% locals anymore, well for those not at platinum level, so I don't feel it's worth it to go here.... For a sub par buffet it's not worth my 20$ per person. Sorry, Vegas has other buffets that are worth it.
I was satisfied coming here when it was 50% locals. For around $17, this buffet was good. BUT, for full price of a 25% discount for most locals, it's not worth it at all. . . The front entrance of the buffet reminds me of a corral where cattle are herded into. There's electronic pay machines one one side, and a small booth for the human counterparts. The problem here is when you want to get a discount, which you can get $1 off with their member card, you have to line up in the human one, and that one is LONG at times.. . Service is pretty lazy, and the layout of the buffet seating is pretty odd in places. Booths can feel broken at times, and chairs are uncomfortable. Drinks are drinks, but the alcohol service is pay by drink (others like Studio B are complimentary). . . This buffet is large, but most of it is made up of "make your own" stations that suck. Make your own tacos (with prepackages/easy to cut up stuff), and whatnot litter this place. . . The food is basically O.K. Not amazing, but not disgusting by any means. Salad and soups are standard fare, asian sections sit around for a while (cheap sushi sits out, and certain steamed items get hard and gooy after a while). Crab legs (though I hate them) were rather thin, but people still flock to them. What I find surprising is that the previously frozen fried food was great--fried perfectly, and the deserts were pretty good (aside from the random one that looks great, but tastes horrid and is hard to eat). . . If you're a visitor, go somewhere else.. If you're a local without their "platinum" membership, go somewhere else.. If you have that platinum membership card, think about going.
The buffet is a little much but it is worth it. They had EVERY thing. I had no issues with this place as the food was spot on. I will go here again next trip to Las Vegas.
My family and I used to love this buffet, when it was 50% off for locals. Now today we went at my daughters request for her birthday (I called ahead confirmed pricing and learned it's now 25% off for locals) . . We wait in line, go to pay and the idiot (they hire a lot of them) says no locals discount on Sat, WHAT? I let her know I called ahead I was told there was a discount, let me speak to your manager..  She then pretended to call on the phone and a radio she never actually spoke to anyone "sorry manager is not available for the next 20 mins" are you kidding me???? Talk about NO customer service, . . The Rio USED to be all about locals, guess what? Not anymore way to go we live here and would frequent more often. The Buffet was good but not $30 a person good. So for now this local says see ya!  . Unless you plan to train your people to provide good customer service ie: be polite, understanding and accommodating, not shrug your shoulders and stare off blankly, and bring back the 50% off all locals then MAYBE I'll be back otherwise I'd rather pay for a better place
The food is still good. A bit overpriced really but that stops no one. The lines can get crazy.. . They are a bit nuts about making sure you don't get in with a discount. Our local friend tried to get us in but had to run home to get ID, and a utility bill to prove he lives there. We had to wait, but in the end we got in that time with a discount.. Other times we paid full fare. . . This time the crab legs were too salty. That was one thing we were looking forward to but didn't enjoy after the first bite. Sad.. . Bananas Foster...where else can you get it out of New Orleans? Not many places. They have it here.. . Convention facilities: Huge..plenty of room for almost anything.
This is such a LARGE buffet!  Probably the largest I've ever seen so there are lots of options.  That being said, the food was acceptable but not outstanding.  The good thing is that it was fresh, not old.  The bad thing is that it was average tasting.  There's nothing wrong with that when there's so much!  That's why 3stars.  . We got the Champagne brunch, not a bad value for $32 per person.  Our waiter was on the refills too!  . Our server was fantastic!  He earned this place a whole additional star, bumping it up to 4 stars.  :)  He was very nice and responsive to our every want and need.  I would definitely recommend this place, just don't expect gourmet food.
Went there for dinner on friday. Their cold crab legs still had ice crystals in them as if they were just removed from the freezer. The texture was terrible. I would not recommend this buffet to anyone. If you are looking for some crab legs, you are better off going someweher else.
The service was quite nice and did come to check up on us but the food was more mediocre at this buffet. I had pasta and the steaks and I liked them but neither were spectacular. There was no prime rib so that also disappointed me. I did notice that there was a lot of bread which would be nice if you could take it. The soup bar and teppanyaki were nice and customizable but nothing too special in terms of taste. This buffet reminds me of the Asian buffets in New York or LA that you can go to for $10 so it's not great but still good..         The dessert section had lots of pies and cookies. The gelato was alright as well. There didn't seem to be anything that stood out to me though..         I liked the decor and the VIP seating area. The way the buffet is set up is nice because the food is all in a row so you can just keep walking to the right or to the left.
This buffet used to be my favorite, but not anymore. The crab legs were bad, too salty, not fresh. They were not cut open, took forever to eat them.. . We went there on a tuesday night at 8:45. They had so many empty tables but they let you waited for so long! and the moment you got in, you don't really have time to eat! SOOOOO terrible!!!!!! will never go back!!! never!!!!
Not bad, this buffet is big!!! I got the 24 hour pass and we ate around 9:30... They close at 10pm but kept serving until everyone leaves! And all the food is still restock!! Wow very good. Dinner plus taxes and everything I saw it came to be $35. We got the 24 hours pass and didn't need to pay. . . Lots, lots, lots of food. They even have a pho station, wonton , and other stuff. Out of all buffets for just the 24 hours! would this would come in 2nd and  bannchanel first.
I thought the overall selection was outstanding!  I purchased the 24 hour buffet pass for the third time, but this was my first experience at RIO.  I thought the food selection was diverse and the overall quality was good.  For the size of the entree food, I would have expected more of a dessert selection.......oh well I was too full to eat a lot of sweets anyway.
This is the first buffet I ever had in Vegas, way back in the day. 7 years later I still come here when I'm in town.. . First off, It's HUGE. There is pretty much everything your heart desires here. I'm fond of their Asian selections, with dim sum and some really delicious duck. Also, the variety of seafood is large, with crab legs to boot. I don't even know why you'd pay the extra on buffet of buffets to eat at the seafood buffet.. . Desserts always vary, and they have gelato.. . Even in all the times I've been here, I feel like there are parts of this buffet I haven't even seen because there is just that much there. Staff is also pretty attentive with drinks and anything else you need.
Don't come here expecting to get a local discount worth eating at this mediocre buffet. We used to come here and eat for around $30 which was reasonable for 2 people. Called to double check to make sure the discount was still available before driving to the strip and sure enough it says half off on the recording.  Well after gambling and standing in line to pay we learned that you have to be a triple gold platinum star rewards member or some bs.. Lame. Time and travel wasted.. Super hungry. Now it's only 25% off for locals.. Would have been $50 for both if us. I rather go to the M buffet and eat some quality food for that kind of $. The manager even refused to honor the discount on the recording. So no more reason for us to come to the Rio and spend any of our money. I'll go to a Station casino where the prices are reasonable for 3 star buffet cuisine..
