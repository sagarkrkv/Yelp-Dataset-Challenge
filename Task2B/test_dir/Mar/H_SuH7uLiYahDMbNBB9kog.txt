Food was pretty good I got bulgogi fries I wish the fries were a little crunchier and there needed to be more meat on it.. Chicken taco didn't have as much flavor as I hoped but my boyfriend got the shrimp taco and that was delicious
Amazing food!!! Love how they mix things up and really friendly owner. A+ restaurant. Always eat here at least 3x a week on my lunch break. Great serving of food. Will recommend to everyone...
Komex is amazing. You must get the flautas with spicy guacamole and the pork belly musubi is to die for.
Love them and the food.  Outstanding! I have been here way to many times to count...and it is always good.
I read all the great comments thinking this place would be a great find. To my disappointment, I was not pleased. . . The service was very slow, even though it wasn't very busy. There were even other customers complaining asking where their food was. Come to find out, the food was just sitting on top of the counter waiting to be served. Another couple next to us paid for their drinks and left after waiting way too long for their food. . . We finally got our food after about 30 mins. We ordered the bulgogi fries, combination fried rice and the bulgogi burrito. Everything just tasted average. Nothing to rave about. . . I will not be coming back.
Found this place via Yelp to grab some nosh before heading home to LA. It's definitely a solid little spot to try out. Their menu is a little confusing with a lot of items sounding very similar to each other so the yelp photos helped.. .  We ordered half orders of the Fushion Bulgogi fries &Chicken Teriyaki but their portions were very substainly sized. I ordered three tacos for myself - Shrimp, fried Calamari, and Pork Belly. I really liked the shrimp and the pork belly tacos... the Calamari taco tasted like a fish taco. Not bad, just not chewy and squidy like I'd expected.. . The Bulgogi fries were deliucious! Perfect hang over food - wish I'd paid attention and requested no jalapenos but just ended up picking them off.. . I really liked the guacamole that comes with their chips - if I wasn't heading out of town, I would have ordered the 1lb to-go side they offer of it.
5 stars because the customer service and the food was great! The waitress was really good to us especially, because my son was being a brat, and she really went out of her way to help him with treats etc. The food was very different hence some of the names (fusion). We for the bulgogi fries which were an a recommendation from previous posts. Totally worth it!
.. still some of the best in town. and the calamari tacos....wow. Bulgogi tacos still hits the spot for me.
Long overdue review. . . KIMCHI FRIED RICE IS A MUST!!!! ANYTHING with the kimchi is good.. . We ordered a couple of other dishes like the kimchi burrito, nachos, fish tacos, sandwiches. They're just OK. . . The place is small, service is quick with a smile. Since all the food is made to order, prepare to wait a bit.
Found this restaurant on yelp.  Based on reviews decided to give it a try. The service was excellent the food was of high quality. The presentation was nice the flavors were outstanding.. . We enjoyed the smothered fries the flauta' and the crispy rice and then sampled the fried wontons. everything was done extremely well. Prices are very reasonable and I would highly recommend this restaurant. . . The food is prepared fresh everything was done to perfection. You may have to wait since the food is fresh and prepared when ordered. . . Customer service is excellent. Food presentation is very appealing. I could see this restaurant growing if it had a bigger floor plan.
Love the food and feel of this place. A well hiden  jewel I've tried about 90percent of the menu and it all rocks! There is a wait for lunch but well worth it, the flavors that just dance in your mouth are great!
OrderTheFusion!. See what happened there? KoMex is so good that is makes you type in fusion. I mean it when I say you should ignore all items on the menu that aren't fusion love children.. I also mean it when I say add kimchi to everything.. And I extra-double-super-hybrid-sir-mix-a-lot mean it when I say ask for the hot sauce carousel. The chunky Korean spicy salsa alone is worth the visit.. Also, be careful when searching for this tragically named establishment on your phone. It will autocorrect to Kotex.
Kind of a throw back joint.  Food was pretty good.  Some of the things that go to me were a few soggy tortilla chips and the beef taste over marinated,a little to salty.  But over all the service was great.  Again, it is what it, simply great.  So when you approach the door of this local "hole in the wall" joint leave your pretenious thoughts ouside and prepair yourself for great food truck style food, in a sit down restaurant. Mmmm, mm...
"simply the best!!!!! they catered our grand opening and it was the talk of the day..."
Pretty good! Great prices! The best thing about this place is the fact that there is nothing else like it. I was very surprised with how well they blended the flavored of Mexican and Korean. Probably will not be back unless I want to show a friend but it was good.
I actually dream about this place. The portions are heavy The prices are low. The food is delicious. Fusion Chimichanga knocked me out.
I've been eyeing KoMex since summer of 2012 and I finally got to try this past trip. Better late than never. . Even though it's a bit of a drive from the strip, I am so glad we made it out (then again I wasn't the one driving... Thank you P!) . As per many yelpers' recommendation, we tried bulgogi nachos (with kimchi on the side), Fusion Flautas, and spicy pork kimchi fried rice. . I love Korean Mexican fusion. So. Good.. We order the half size bulgogi nachos and that was plenty for the two of us. Their home made chips were great and they were not stingy with the toppings. I could eat this all day long.. The flautas were also delicious. Bulgogi plus cheese rolled in flour tortillas and deep fried. What more could you ask? Gucamole you said? Yes, they come with the flautas and were fresh and excellent! We were really full already by the time the fried rice arrived at our table. I had a couple bites, but the flautas definitely had my heart. My friend though on the other hand couldn't stop eating the fried rice even though he was really full. . They also have 4 different kind of salsa. I only got to try 3 of them because I was too busy stuffing my face with everything else. The green one was alright. Not too memorable. But the other two that I tried were amazing. One of them kind of remind me of the sauce Kogi truck uses. It has a nice balance of vinegary and spiciness, except the one here has an extra kick at the end. The kick at the end is pretty strong. The other one is on the sweet side, and if I could I would steal their salsa home. Remember to grab the salsa containers when your complementary tortilla chips arrived!
