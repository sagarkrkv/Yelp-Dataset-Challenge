We had an excellent stay at the Circus Circus. Our room was clean, we were given fresh towels daily, and had a lot of fun playing $5 blackjack at the table and $1 blackjack at the nearby Slots-o-Fun. Food at the Westside Deli was also tasty and affordable. I would highly recommend staying here!
Zero Starts if I could!. . If your going to Vegas and plan to stay at Circus circus Just Stay home!! Worst place on earth! Drinks are nasty! Place is dirty and stinks! Hotel is super old and just plain cheap. Not to mention we got the best room available and was so disappointed!!. . Never again, Next time we will stay at Rio or Another hotel/casino!
Free acrobatic performance. Cheap tables. Play area for kids. Don't really offer drinks on slots, and only occasionally on tables.
I've stayed twice in less than a year, the 1st time so amazing I was forced to come Addison because I didn't have enough time to do everything I wanted, this past week we starred , 3 days, the adventure dome was closed all week which would have been nice to know when we booked, I would have booked somewhere else and just visited the joke of a circus, room was ok I liked the skyrise tower better but not a big deal, leaving hotel my 4 year old almost gets ran over by Terry the female valet driver, everyone was nice to me then trying to comp me wristbands for the park that wasn't open and buffet tickets like it makes up for scaring the crap out of myself and my child because they hired people who drive like bats out of hell, I loved this hotel, I used to go there when I was small with my family, im close to 30, I'm sorry I took my kids there I will never recommended this place to anyone again after raving about it since I stayed there the time before last, my kids were treated better at caesers palace, venitian, and planet Hollywood staff and security, where you would expect to see no children....
I stayed in the manors for 2 nights.  It was the worst Vegas experience ever.  Might as well have stayed at the Travelodge right next door...because they look,  feel and sound like a 3rd class motel.. . This "hotel" seems like it hasn't been updated since it was built in 1968.  I got a callous on my thumb from pushing the awful toilet flusher button.  The blankets were covered in suspicious-looking hairs.  There was a brown stain I could only hope was chocolate.. . It's at the butt-end of the strip, you have to walk through the main Circus Circus hotel, then past 2 empty lots facing some "fancy" shops such as 7-11, Ross and McDonald's.  By the time we walked to the Venetian, we were so exhausted we turned back without even gambling.
I am definitely not impressed or satisfied with my stay here at Circus Circus! The room service and any service at that is just ridiculous. The people here are rude and greedy. I was appalled with the cleanliness. The hotel was just gross. I had to call room service everyday just to get towels and coffee. Oh, and there is a 2 cup of coffee per day limit! Also the ice maker didn't work the whole week I stayed and the soda machine ripped me off not only that it is three bucks for a pop but it doesn't give you back any change. I've stayed in Motel 6's that were better than this place! I enjoyed some of the stores and gift shops here although if you weren't gonna buy anything they pretty much could care less about you and wanted you to leave. Lastly, The Adventuredome, that place is a joke! All the games are rigged and if you when the people act like they're pissed. Oh and just a heads up you can only win once they want tell you that though because they will take your money then tell you no refunds. By far my worst stay in a hotel, clowns must be running this place!
My experience was terrible here! Rolled up in a mustang convertible only to find that where they put us was the motor lodge. Yeah, the motor lodge. This is the behind the trailer park dump. I ironed my bed and was scared to stay there. I was at the rio the night before and that was amazing. Should have stayed there. Let's just say being a delta sky miles member andhaving 100,000,000 sky miles, this is the only trip I was happy to leave all because of this hotel. The rest of the trip was awesome, don't get me wrong, not trying to be negative but come on! Circus Circus, You need to step up your game.
I only came here to gamble so I cannot comment on the rooms and such. However, that being said, the Circus Circus is one of the most depressing casinos I have ever been in. I don't understand what happened to it but this place needs help desperately. This goes without saying but we all know that casinos are very smoky, however, upon walking in the entrance I said, "My god, the smell." It smelled as though 20 years had gone by with no cleaning, filtration, or fresh air, and the smell of extremely stale smoke made it hard to breathe. Against my better judgement, I still proceeded to the casino and was amazed at how sad and run down everything looked. I cannot not recommend this hotel/casino to anyone to stay, let alone gamble.
This was a pretty crappy hotel, but at $37 a night on the strip, what do you expect? The building itself looked like it hadnt been updated since the '60s. Our room was in Skyrise Tower and looked like a low-end motel. Looked clean from a distance but on closer inspection, we found crumbs and sesame seeds on the floor and a quarter inch of dust on top of the entertainment center. One of the issues I had was with the AC unit. Although it keeps the room cool, the fan doesn't stay on continuously and kicks on, rather loudly, in the middle of the night. My boyfriend is a light sleeper and didn't have a single night of decent sleep while we stayed here. The ventilation in the rooms is pretty bad too. I have asthma and had difficulty breathing the whole time we were in the building.. . The only interaction we had with hotel employees, besides at restaurants, was the day we checked in. Joseph helped us out and was very pleasant and knowledgeable. We rented a car for one day from Avis, which is located in the hotel lobby. It was convenient to have a car rental agency right in the hotel and the woman who helped us was speedy and polite.. . We don't have kids, but Circus Circus seems like a great place to bring them. We walked through the Adventuredome, which has rides and games, and the Midway, located above the casino, has carnival-style games and circus acts, like acrobats.. . Although Circus Circus isn't nice by any means, we paid for one week what we would have paid for one night in a nicer place on the strip, so I'd definitely stay here again (I'm not super picky about where I stay as long as it's relatively clean and safe, so if you're one of those who refuses to stay anywhere but a 4 or 5 star hotel, this is not the place for you!). People complain about it's location on strip (it's way up north, just before Hilton and Stratosphere), but we had no issues and took the Deuce everywhere, as there is a stop just outside Circus Circus.
First I would like to say that all the staff were great. . The main issue I have is that its time to UP GRADE the facade and surrounding buildings in the circus circus grounds. . However , this is the place to go if you have children. . It was very affordable and rooms were well kept (west tower). Keep in mind that its affordability is what attracts a certain clientele.
Never coming back here at circus circus. We booked a king size bed room for 3 nights a few days before we came here. When we checked in, Vanessa said no more king size bed room for us. Is this the way you do business?
This was probably the worst experience that I have ever experience while staying in Vegas I got poor service from the front desk to the bell stand to valet (no one had a since of urgency) and elevators did not work so I was forced to carry all of my belongings a stroller and a two-year-old down 8 flights of stairs because the elevators did not work they had 6 elevators and only one work so if you expect to go to your room anytime during the day you might as well wait till about 11 o'clock at night is the only time that the elevators work properly
I would give it 0 stars if I could. Just checked in and I'm already searching for another hotel to stay at. Booked rooms online. Our rooms are not even connected to the hotel. Had to go outside cross the street with my luggage through another parking lot to get to my room. I did not feel safe wheeling my luggage at night. It would have been better to stay at motel 6. The curtains look like they are falling off and won't close all the way I had to rig them to keep them shut. I can here the people in the room next to us talking. This place seems so shady!!  NEVER AGAIN!!  ******* update......Okay I update my review from negative 10 stars to 1 star only because Belinda at the players club check in helped ease my mind and made things better for us. If I was doing this rating on Belinda's customer service I would give it a 10 she was awesome in explaining our room upgrade and changes.  We have checked out of the circus circus Manor hell hole and are now stating in one of the updated rooms (FYI it's still weird when I hear everytime the neighbors flush their toilets .... But that's just me).  FYI unless your kids already know about the birds and the bees you might want to keep them at home. Even in the upgraded room the walls are thin. I'm writing this as my neighbors are having a "great time" next door. So if you don't want your neighbors knowing when you start and finish you might want to keep it down lol.
I learned how to gamble here, and I loved it!  Here's why:. . 1 - You can't beat a $5 buy-in for craps!  I had a blast losing $50, playing with a new $50 to get back up (and I DID!!!)  It was so much fun. . 2 - You can't beat free drinks and fun people who are serious about having fun. . 3 - It was a close walk to our hotel, so it was awesome to avoid cabs . . 4 - The lights are amazing, and the energy is high!
A solid casino & hotel for it being one of the oldest ones on the strip. If you don't have kids with you on the trip, you might want to say further down at one of the newer casino's, but this one definitely gives you some kid-friendly action along with all the other Vegas casino add-ons!
Booked my hotel on Priceline.com for $50.   Hotel is dated but for the price I can't complain.
This is for my black jack dealer - we stumbled in - don't ask me how - this has got to be the last stop b4 dealer hell. . Imagine cheap, drunk rude people - no it wasn't that bad but at 12 am I bet it is pretty awful. Let's face it - this is not the "Wynn". The people are barely a step up from homeless. . But our dealer was so Sweet - cheerful - singing - joking - great entertainment - we had an absolute BLAST!  I have played at the nice casino's and the dealers are Boring. Can't get them to even smile. . Sadly -- I lost - but - totally worth the experience. Next time I want to whine about things I will remember that poor lady dealing with not nice people - rocking out to 70's tunes - having a terrific day!. That is a woman who has a rich life and knows what is important!
Rude !! They lie on the website . For instance, the details about the room are scams . Youll find a 1990 TV  and so on .Moreover, service is bad , I won't recommend it at all .
Shower drain did not drain after showering each person in the family had to sit or stand in 1 inch of water stuck at the bottom. . It's the first week of spring break for quite a few people in the US and fun dome is open until 6 o'clock in the evening only. The wind howled through the windows all night long kept everybody up the windows were not secure. . when we sat down on the toilet it felt like it was going to fall through the floor and also bangs up really loud against the wall the matter how softly you sit. . Not enough towels for all three people in the room. The towels that were there were small very thin and almost everyone had a hole in. . The fan or air conditioner makes noise when it was going off kept us up, we had to turn it on or bake in the room. . When taking showers we had to use the fan which did not work at all for it's purpose, we got out of the shower and it was completely steamed up. . The fan that is supposed be used for the bathroom did not serve it's purpose. Wait too small and we couldn't keep it on because of the rattling and shaking of the Fan. . Every other hotel we went to in Vegas had many of the blackjack machines that cost either $.25 $.50 or a dollar. We found zero in Circus Circus that were $.25 or $.50, everyone was one dollar. You would think for a family oriented Hotel and Casino with families on budgets that would be one of their first priorities being such a popular game.. . Overall we were very very disappointed. Although they have two pools the area to layout is very limited and the pools are very very small compared to any other hotel on the strip. We understand it's cheap to stay there but the rooms in the motor Lodge area were unacceptable.
This is only for the Midway Arcade area.  I think this is the only place that has games for kids therefore it gets very crowded.  But many of the games give out bigger better prizes if there are more players.  (so it's a good thing that it's busy)  You know when a show is going to start soon because multiple player games would be nearly empty.  . . They've increased the price of some of the games from $1 to $2.  I just wish they have a better ventilation system because of smokers.
So, we booked this hotel because I was able to get a few comps through my mlife membership. We chose CC since we were dragging along our 4yo with us this trip and wanted to have some convenient things for her and us to do together. After reading a lot of the reviews I felt that I made probably one of the worst decisions of my adult life and that our daughter would suffer some psychological damage later in life, but....low and behold.....things we're alright. Yes it's older and rundown in comparison to the strip hotels, obviously. You can tell they are upgrading things slowly but surely and I was actually put at ease upon entering. I hate cigarette smoke, but know it's unavoidable in Vegas but the ventilation throughout the hotel seemed good. Check in was the worst experience for us. Took about an hour on a Friday night/Saturday morning about 12:30am, would have thunk so many people stay here and check in that late. . I can't remember the tower we stood in but apparently it was the remodeled tower and we were definitely surprised about that comfort and quality of the room. The beds were super comfy and the room was pretty dang spacious. I was expecting the worst and was very pleased. Take it, we usually stay at the Vdara so this was definitely a "culture shock" of sorts expectation wise but at the same time, we're not picky people. The restroom was nice and roomy and good mirror space and lighting. The AC worked like a charm and every stinkin' hotel employee we had contact with was very nice and helpful, and not in that...I work at a 4/5 star hotel so I have to treat you nice, way. It was genuinely nice, especially the house keepers. . We hadbooked 2 nights and I had actually booked them separately since we weren't sure how long of a trip it was going to be so they were going to swap us rooms for the second night, I called the front desk and asked them if there was any way we could stay in the current room so we wouldn't have to pack up and unpack again and after about 10 minutes they made it happen without a fuss. Customer service was definitely on point. . As for the weird "gift shops" and time share people, we never encountered any of them and the shop people done fuss either.
