Visited for the first time  2/23/13 . They spin good music , plenty of VIP table & booths / the crowd was very attractive which is always a plus and the overall atmosphere was on point ! Minor complaints - a couple of the girl bartenders were rude & the dance floor is a little on the small side ; & this place gets packed so it def could use more dancing space ! I did enjoy this place more than TAO though . Will definitely return next time I'm In Vegas !
It's awesome, lots of douchebags to choose from!  hahaha.. . Makes me miss the old school Korean clubs, that was fun.
This place is terrible. Only club I've paid bottles for and can't even give them away because this place is so bad. Everyone has too much alcohol. Also really rachet crowd
That night that you don't remember? Probably happened at Tryst. Wow, Tryst was just a ton of crowded, crowded, crowded fun!! There were tables everywhere and an average sized dance floor. . . My friend got the hookup for her party and we were seated at the table/booth that is under a rock, directly to the left of the waterfall. And wow, was it private. And beautiful. It was far away enough to get away from the craziness of the rest of the club! Plus bottle service! It was an absolutely fun night! . . I do have to say that even though they warned us, it was just way too crowded. I feel like they should limit entrance to a certain number, because people could have really gotten hurt by how close everyone was through the aisles and on the dance floor.
