Best steak of my life! I'm not kidding! This place is fantastic- I don't even know where to begin. I didn't think the greens beans would be one of the most memorable parts of my dish. I think it caught me off guard how amazing green beans could taste. The steak is out of this world- it cuts like butter. And there isn't a better way to end your meal than with sticky toffee pudding!
The dinner seating and view was fabulous. However, I think the menu is a little pricey.. . * Sauteed Loup de Mer, Barigoule, Braised Artichoke, Basil Pistou $54 (4 of 5) Tasty sea bass without bones. This was a tasty piece of white fish and I really enjoyed the braised artichoke.  . * Sauteed New York State Foie Gras, Slow Braised Pineapple, Alsace Spice Cake $28 (3.5 of 5) I really enjoyed the seared foie gras and braised pineapple, but I didn't think the spice cake complimenting the dish. I didn't think the texture of flavor complimented the dish. . . Overall, This place is beautiful and spectacular views, but to be price conscience, I will just go back for drinks and dessert.
We had a pre set dinner price of $300.00 plus for Valentines Day. I had One glass of wine $18.00, our total bill was greater than $400. Our wait time was over an hour with reservations. 2 courses were so overdone they could not be eaten. We told the server who said he would talk to the chef. A different server brought the next course. No one came to check or ask how our meal was. The location of the table overlooked a wall, even with reservations. We contacted Sharon the manager upon return home who offered us another visit to the facility which is unattainable for us as we live across the country. We reached out again to see if she could accommodate us in another way and never got a response. . I would never recommended this restaurant to anyone.. I have eaten at many five star restaurants this is the worst experience I have ever had at one.
Food was superb. Got to watch the water show from the Bellagio while eating. I gave four stars because the waiters/waitresses were kinda snobby but they knew their stuff.
My mother and I had the prefix dinner menu before the Jersey Boys. For our first course my mother had the kale salad and I had the french onion soup. The kale salad had just the right amount of dressing and was delicious. However the onion soup had a hair in it and I pointed it out to the waiter as soon as he dropped it off he apoligized and brought me another soup which was ok but hard to enjoy after there was a hair... For our second course I had the flank steak which was just ok and my mother had the salmon which she really enjoyed. We both loved our desserts. We both had a few cocktails and they were all very good.   all the choices on the strip I dont think I will come back due to having a hair in my soup and not having anything taken off the final bill....  I worked in the restaurant industry and if there is a hair in your food a manager comes to the table!
Went there on Valentine's day, and they have a special menu for that day. Food n drinks were really good except the desert. Great customer service. Reasonable price.
Restaurant has a great view of the strip and would surely go there for the views but not the food.  If you want good French food seek elsewhere but don't miss out on the views here and the souffle
In a word... Souffle. Their weightless, fluffy, and perfectly prepared chocolate souffle is utterly exquisite. Complemented by a stellar view of the Vegas strip and a front row view of the Bellagio's dancing water show, this delicious dessert is well worth the the 25 minute preparation time. It was an exceptional way to finish off a delicious meal that began with a warm lobster and fennel appetizer followed with a moist and tender filet of salmon in a pinot noir sauce. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is not likely to disappoint.
One of the best luncheon spots I've been to. Great customer service & delicious meals. It's pretty expensive but the taste matches the price. . . I thought it was higher than 2 floors though & all the way at the top of the Eiffel Tower but it isn't. Still a great experience
This is where my boyfriend spoiled me to a tasting menu dinner for my 30th birthday last night. Amazing ambience, attentive, sweet & knowledgable waitress, decadent amazing food, wines perfectly paired and one of my favorite parts-a window seat overlooking one of my favorite Vegas sights, the beautiful Bellagio fountains. I was spellbound & delighted by the entire experience. Extremely romantic & special. A couple even got engaged in the adjacent corner, it was that kind of perfect venue for it :) Neither of us will ever forget this meal and experience.
Ok I guess I'm on the outs here, but I really wasn't impressed. Sure it looked nice inside and the bathrooms even had a sit down area for u to sit and do makeup. The main thing is the food and service-not the best. First they say we can't take you-not cool, Then someone else goes oh wait we can. Then they take us up elevator-cool. We ask to sit near the fountains overview-didn't happen and they weren't busy at all. I've had 100% better French Onion Soup at a non-French regular old diner joint than here. The French onion soup was creamy like a broc cheese/onion soup and no cheese/bread/or real onion just a thick puree. Secondly, service took forever and after 30 min of waiting for our meals when they weren't even busy at like 2:00pm they told us they were out of steak. So my fiance's mom had to pick something else when she thought we would be getting our meal by then. The blt was good but for the price no way! Only difference was they put avocado on their blt-big whoop and you can get blt's anywhere. I was expecting more exotic French foods. Not overpriced American food and crappy French version of French soup.
I loved my experience here. The food was spectacular and the service was amazing. My husband and I celebrated our 3 year anniversary here. We called to make a reservation. They even have the options to have roses (extra cost) put on the table upon arrival. They seated us by the window and we had the perfect view of the water show at the bellagio, which began as soon as we were seated. My experience here was absoutely wonderful.
Unbelievable! So happy we splurged for this meal. The view is incredible. Our table was by the window with a view of the Bellagio fountains and The Strip. The felit was amazing. My boyfriend likes his rare, I like mine medium, both were cooked to perfection. Service was very attentive and professional. Our server suggested the chocolate souffle for desert and it was well worth it! Best Dinner Experience in Las Vegas!
