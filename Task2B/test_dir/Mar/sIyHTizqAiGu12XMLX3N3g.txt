In Vegas  I really do like to try and stick to my rule of eating at the buffet of the hotel I am staying at and this time I did follow that rule and ate here. Now I had heard a lot of hype about this buffet so I went in with very high expectations. It also cost me $55 so I wanted to make sure I got the most bang for my buck here. I was lucky because I had anticipated waiting in a huge line after reading some of the reviews and I did go at 6:00 which is dinnertime but much to my surprise there was no line when I arrived there. There was one couple in front of me so I was seated very quickly. When I left, however, there was a huge line so it looks like I came right before the big dinner rush so my recommendation is to go about 6:00 to avoid lines. Ok so now for the actual review:. . I was very overwhelmed by the size of this place. There was so much to take in and when I was being taken to my seat the hostess was giving me the guided tour and telling me about all the different stations. I couldn't decide what to try first. My drink order was taken right away and my drink was also served right away which was great. I made a beeline for the seafood section because I love crab legs for one and also because they had clams my other guilty pleasure. I loaded my plate up with crab legs, clams, and mussels. The crab legs honestly were very mediocre. I have had better crab legs at Red Lobster. The clams and the mussels however were excellent and I went back for seconds on those. The rest of the stations were rather unappealing to me. The food did not look that great. I got more mussels and clams and some bread and cranberry sauce from the American station and whats funny is even though I love the stuff that cranberry sauce was from a can. That was painfully obvious. The stuff tastes great but you expect more from an upscale like buffet. Now for the desserts, the thing that makes the whole buffet worth it. I had flan, creme brulee, some cake, crepes, and some mixed fruit. The dessert was straight up heavenly. I loved every bit of it. They also did a great job of clearing up the plates you were finished at quickly so they did not just sit and pile up on the table. . . Overall this place is best for their seafood and desserts. Everything else seems to be just ok. Not sure if I would go back, that's a maybe. . . Overall,
Currently the best buffet in Vegas.  All the standards (peeled shrimp, Alaskan king crab legs, etc) with the addition of traditional Chinese, Italian, BBQ and so much more.  . . The best items imho are the seafood specialty items (mini clam bakes, puff pastries filled with seafood, etc.). . The price is a bit high and it does get crowded.  As a New Yorker I use the trick to go at 3 or 4 when the lines aren't long.
Pretty good buffet overall. Waiting system where you put your number in to get a text when there's a free table is nice , and on this Friday night we were able to get in right away even though the machines said 55 min. Very diverse selection of food and all of it is pretty well made and fresh. Seating is a little cramped, almost reminded me of a cafeteria or dining hall, which is not what you want when you're paying $54 bucks a person. Other the potential wait times and the seating arrangments, a-ok!
A must if you are in town!
It has the potential of being 5 stars, if the meat was cooked and seasoned better and the hot food was "hot".   Another reason I didn't give it 5 starts was because my server was sick, and she kept sneezing at our table.   I just hope we don't catch what she has......
I don't do buffets, but was told that if there's one buffet that I need to go to, then it's Bacchanal.  I've had Bacchanal bookmarked for over a year and finally got the opportunity to try them.  With over 1,800 reviews and 4,500 pictures already posted, there really is no sense to make this a long review with a ton of pictures.  All I have to say is that I wasn't too impressed. I didn't have a bad experience, I just don't think Bacchanal is 5 or even 4 stars to me.  The service is great, the selection is great, the food is just okay, and the price of $50+ is not worth it. And in my opinion, all these buffets are beginning to taste the same.  I also never seem to get my money's worth at these places.  For the price, I rather be served a good meal then have to wait in line for a "just okay" one. But at least I finally got to take care of one of my bookmarks.  The End. . . . . YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (059/366)
Great little buffet.  It's not the biggest buffet around, but you'll definitely enjoy yourself.  I had breakfast there once and it was definitely something I'd check out again.  I'd recommend showing up early if you want to check it out.. . PRO:. +Delicious options. +Buffet provides little rubber holders for the hot plates so you don't burn your hands. +Wait staff is very helpful and cleans dishes quickly. +Very convenient for those staying in the Palace Tower @ Caesars. . CON:. -Smaller than other Vegas buffets  . -Sometimes there's a large line to get in
The food quality isn't as good as it was when they first opened but still nonetheless one of the buffets in Vegas that you have to try or come back to. The crab legs that was once the Must Have is not meh, typical buffet crab legs. My wife loves the fresh oysters and I absolutely love....... Get ready for it...... Wait for it...... Wait....... Here it comes........ Anthony! (Think that's his name) the big brother that serves the meat. Dude is funnier than hell. Whoever is reading this please correct his name for me. You'll know who he is if you went. People like him makes you smile and enjoy the food that much more.
Caesar's Palace? I would have done better to go to Little Caesar's.. . I have to that, in a lifetime of eating in buffet restaurants, from cruise ship buffets to hometown smorgasbords, this is the single worst experience I've ever had.. . We pulled into Vegas exhausted and hungry after an 8-hour drive, and decided to just do the buffet at Caesar's Palace, where we were staying. We'd heard it was good, and, as we both have dietary restrictions, we thought it would be a pretty good bet. Usually we have no trouble finding enough that we can eat on a good buffet, and we were too tired to plow through restaurant listings to try to find something better that could accommodate us.. . Before I go on to the food, I do have to mention the price. Yes, I get that everything in Vegas is expensive, but $116 for a buffet meal for two people that doesn't even include a beer is pretty OTT. I don't like most soft drinks, so that meant water for me (or pay more on top of the already outrageous price for something drinkable). We probably should have backed out at that point, but we were starving and we were on vacation, so.... . Still, it would have been OK if the food had been decent, but it was just horrible. In fact, It's difficult to describe just how terrible the food was. The salad greens were dried out and wilted. The salad dressings were completely mixed up, and dressings from one container dribbled into others. This was a serious problem, as my husband has a dangerous seafood allergy and one of the dressings was Caesar. None of the employees seemed to know which dressing was which, or what was in anything. We finally had to ask for  a separate bowl of ranch dressing to make sure he didn't get something that had been contaminated with seafood.. . On the pizza bar, the only vegetarian choice was plain cheese, and it was bland and tasteless. I've had better pizza from the freezer compartment at Safeway. The rice and beans on the Mexican bar were also dried out and next to tasteless. Even the pita in the Mediterranean section was dry. I have, seriously, had better food in a high school cafeteria.. . To make things worse, the steam table in the carvery section was badly in need of cleaning. I couldn't stand to walk past it, the smell was so bad. Really nasty!. . Finally, to add insult to injury, the dish of pistachio ice cream I got  in the hopes of finding SOMETHING worth eating for that kind of money tasted more like vanilla than pistachio. . . Suffice it to say we won't be back. If we want another buffet meal in Vegas we'll walk over to Mirage...it's pricey too (though not this pricey!), but at least the food is edible!
In terms of quantity, Bacchanal Buffet is No. 1 in Vegas. In terms of price, . service and maybe even quality, it's No.2. . . I'm gonna skip a lot of food details because there are tons of new reviews every . day about this place. The Mexican section and the meats were my favorites but . they have almost everything you can think of. I'll just say this: You cannot . possibly eat it all. And what you do eat is of quality taste and preparation. . But it's impossible to "get your money's worth" and any time spent waiting in a . line for this is time wasted. I think the only way I'd go back is if it wasn't . my choice, which is to say if friends of mine wanted to go, I would join them. . . Do not mistake this for a bad review -- the place is expensive but tasty. It's . just not my favorite. Wanna know what is?
Went for the Friday night $55.00 dinner...here ya go folks...Bellagio and Rio are WAAAY better. . Totally bummed on this. Not what I expected, not what everyone else experienced either I guess :(. . I was super stoked on this place as its rated the "Best" I Yelped it and I was excited...super sad faced now.... . Food Coma? For sure, of course, satisfied though? Nope.. . The Lobster Corn Chowda had no Lobster, the Miso Glazed Sea Bass was so fishy and cold it was inedible. The crab did not come off the legs even though they were split and the ribs tasted funny...like crappy funny :(. . I was really looking forward to the Souffle they make to order...didn't have it, FAIL. . . I was excited for the chicken basket everyone was bragging about on here, didn't  have it, FAIL :(. . I went to get Pho, no one was there to help me and I wanted the soup dangit!!. . Beers were cheap, service was good but I really cant say much more...Oh wait, yes I can...I got DIRTY SHRIMPS...nuff said :/
Let me just preface by saying...I had DREAMS about this place. It's that good!!. . I felt like a little kid in a candy store when I first stepped in here and didn't even know where to begin with the crazy large selection of food from Asian to Mexican to Italian..you name it!. . I loved their sweet potato tots, steamed crab, Japanese ramen, dim sum...well I basically loved it all...Oh, and I loved the drink selection they had right by the fried food with fresh HORCHATA, pineapple juice, and many more in these cute, individual glass jars (it's the little things!). . And don't even get me started on the desserts! Ahh, these are the times I wish my stomach was bigger so I could try everything, but unfortunately, by the time I was eating desserts, my stomach felt like it was going to explode.  Still, from what I managed to stuff in my mouth before feeling sick, my favorites were the Black sesame mochi, sticky toffee ice cream, macarons, and build your own CREPES...my mouth is watering at the thought! . . The wait is reallyyyy long here, especially on the weekends (I know someone who waited 5 hours!) so try coming for an early lunch/dinner or be prepared to wait! I think you can give them your phone number, and go do your own thing, then they'll call you back when it's time so you don't have to stand in line the whole time which is a plus!. . Even if you're not a fan of buffets or aren't too keen in spending $55 for one meal, you owe it to yourself to try to this place out once in your life...it's definitely an experience eating here!
I was excited to come try this place out since I heard good things but was quickly disappointed when most of the food was cold. There is a variety of food to try but quality is sub par. It's not worth the price and will not return.
VERY good they have so much selection of food. i mean the quality isnt the best but they do have a lot of differnet types of food in a nice .  . iv been here twice and rememebr i had to be taken to my hotel room via forklift...its NUTS i ate the whole place it was delicious! . . only knock ont his place is the CCCCCCCCRAZY PRICE but could be worth it. watch out for the line! can be super long. they also have a cheasy fast pass line where you pay extra...oh vegas....so dirty
The buffet totally makes up for the long wait.. . My party and I went Friday night to kick off our Vegas weekend. Initially I was so pissed at how they made us wait in this small corner FOREVER after telling us our table would be ready in 15 minutes. But we got to the buffet and all was forgiven.. . They have different cuisines so naturally, I had to try each one. :P My friends were all about that seafood life. Unlimited oysters and snow crab legs, cooked and cold! I actually fell in love with their duck. They had American, Italian, Asian (including some Dim Sum!!), Mexican, etc. They also had small plates of chef's specialty.. . The dessert bar is HEAVEN. I slipped into a food coma and was sent to buffet dessert bar heaven! They had gelato, cakes, crepes, flan, macarons, cake balls, chocolate covered strawberries (different kinds too!), and anything you could think of.. . If I could have afforded to eat their every night, I would have!
I was a little disappointed in this buffet, maybe I went on the wrong day but many of thedelicious looking items in the cute baskets weren't there the day I went. There were many good items to eat but the lunch price is closer to a dinner price. King crab legs were great though. The prime rib could've been more rare unfortunately. Still a very good quality buffet overall but hopefully the quality doesn't deteriorate.
Come early! or wait in the ridiculous line. or pay the $15 extra bucks!. . I came here 2 times...both times it was around 10 am and the line wasn't packed 30 minutes later people started to line up like a mad house...who knew 30 minutes would make a difference? it's like traffic on the 405 (except that it's 5 minutes instead of 30 lol)...the first time I went, I was amazed by all the food that they had!. . They have the usual breakfast stuff, the Asian (Chinese & Japanese station), Mexican, American, Italian, Seafood, and you can't forget dessert!. . I tend to go to the "freshly made" concoctions which are the noodles where you can get Ramen, Pho, or Chinese Noodle type that's clear broth. Tacos are the bomb! Omelettes and such and the Crepe for dessert!. . As of today, I would say it is the best buffet in Vegas, but you know the second time I went it was a bit lacking but still the best compared to everywhere else..I went the weekend before Christmas. It was quiet but for some reason this place is always packed. For reason with all these people some foods you actually had to wait. The best thing about this place is that they actually have fresh squeez juices in that cute containers...i think they're like apple cranberry, mango, pineapple, and/or green melon (honeydew)...well, the colors at least i usually tend to get the honeydew one lol...but these go out so quick that some times it's not replaced quickly. plus, due to all these people its not as clean cuz people tnd to drop stuff etc on the counters.. . But don't let that discourage you to try this place out. The food is pretty good compared to other buffets and have a lot of choices. but damn buffets this days espcially for vegas and especially for brunch (champaigne included) can run up your bill...say bye bye to your winnings! - if you won in Vegas ;) or say goodbye to your money and say hello to your big belly! lol
My review is the only one you need to read. This is a good breakfast buffet. Wicked Spoon is better. The Bellagio buffet has really gone down-hill, don't even bother. If you have to do a buffet then either this one or Wicked Spoon is the way to go.  I can't believe I got suckered into going to the Paris buffet which I know is awful, and there's a long line like they're giving it away for free (they're not). Luckily I'm a diamond status Harrah's member so I don't wait.   . . I digress.  My favorite 3 breakfast places in Vegas are Bouchon at the Venetian, Bacchanal at Caesar's, Wicked Spoon at Cosmo, and a little diner on Fremont with the best darn diner food ever. Can't remember it's name but it's on the end of Fremont and had the original phone number "1" you can figure it out. Best pancakes etc.....
It was voted the #1 buffet in Vegas by USA Today.  Intrigued by this honor and ready to overindulge Vegas style, we skipped breakfast and headed over for a late lunch.. . There are many stations:  Fresh Seafood, American BBQ, Mexican, Italian, and Asian.. . The oysters were fresh and the jumbo shrimp was not overly cooked.  The cocktail sauce had a nice kick from the horseradish.  Off to a good start!. . The prime rib was overcooked; even the rarest piece was medium-well at best.  . . The meatball was tasty and not filled with breadcrumbs.  The pizzas had a nice crust and were satisfying.. . Step away from the Asian selection.  An interesting amalgamation of Chinese, Thai and  Japanese.  The chow fun was dry, the sushi was what you'd expect at a buffet but the selection (only 3 kinds) was disappointing.  The char sui bao filling was yummy but the bread was hard and the har gow was gummy.. . All in all, just okay.  Buffet includes soft drinks, tea and juice.  Price is steep, but Vegas is not cheap.  And, if you make it your only meal you come out ahead.
I tried Bacchanal during my trip to Las Vegas last weekend.  As this was rated the #1 Buffet in Vegas, I was excited to give it a try. . . There is a large selection of food to choose from. If they don't have it, you probably don't need it. :o)  There are Mexican, Italian, Asian, Southern cuisines and more.  I tried  everything from shrimp and grits, to sushi, to ratatouille, to charcuterie and more.  It was all good enough.  But as the old adage goes, they are a jack of all trades, but master of none. In my opinion, a smaller selection of food prepared impeccably is preferable to everything under the sun and it all being "meh".  I did manage to save a little room for dessert and really enjoyed that station, and I am not a big dessert person.  The chocolate covered strawberries were awesome! They were dipped in butterfingers, how can that be anything but awesome?!. . Overall, the buffet is aesthetically pleasing.  The food selection is quite diverse. But I do not feel it is worth the $55+ per person.  I much preferred the more reasonably priced buffet at the Rio.
Unreal!!! Excellent quality food as far as you can see...Crab,oyster,shrimp,prime rib, ham, turkey,sushi blah, blah -it never ends and it's all wonderful. The room is so beautiful and the servers are good. However $17 for a small glass of wine was ridiculous.
S2. . This buffet took my Vegas buffet top spot; sorry Bellagio.  . . Great variety and freshness.  Decor is quite nice.  They keep sending mimosas at me! . . I would definitely look out for the long lines...btw you can get a $1 discount/person if you have a Total Rewards card (which is free, and you can get while you kill time waiting.)
My second trip to the Bacchanal buffet was not the same as my first experience. This second time around was disappointing. Lamb chops where tough and not eatable. BBQ beef ribs where partially raw. Shrimp cocktail was off. I found it strange that there was no line on a Sunday night around diner time. I'm so bummed b/c we had such an amazing first experience. Probably won't be back considering how expensive this buffet is. :(
This buffet definitely lives up to the hype. . . Line can get ridiculous (I'm talking 2+ hour wait) unless you want to pay extra moneyor just be lucky enough to be or have someone in your party be a platinum/diamond member and bypass it (Thanks June! :)) . . Although parties of 8 or more are automatically charged 18% gratuity, the service was beyond exceptional and unlike any other buffet we've been to.. . Best part of the buffet is the dessert! I love the made-to-order crepes and the mochi ice cream. Unlimited. That's the way to go  . . And if you find yourself not wanting to wait in line for that long you can walk to the buffet at the Bellagio, which nowadays has a shorter queue (and serves beef Wellington which bacchanal unfortunately lacks)
If you're trying to decide what buffet is worth waiting, paying and going to in Vegas, consider your decision made, GO HERE!. . This buffet has something (or a lot of things) for everyone regardless of whether you're an all you can eat seafood lover or enjoy a few bites of basic foods.. . The buffet starts off with the section I don't even bother looking at, seafood. From what I can tell they have crab legs, mussels, shrimp, oysters, ceviche, etc. . . Then you get to the fried potato, bbq type sides and meat station. All sorts of meats from ribs to sausages to chicken. I choose the truffle tots, waffle fries and mac and cheese from this section. (I'm the enjoy a few bites of basic food type.). . Then you have at least 5 kinds of bread and 4 types of soup.. . Then you get to the mexican station, one of my favorites. You can make your own tacos here, or any other sort of mexican creation between the rice, beans, different meats, sauces and toppings they offer. Nachos made with waffle fries anybody?. . Then you go around the corner to the second part of the buffet. Here you have some pastas to choose from, made to order omelet bar or boiled crab legs (depending on the type of day), and pizza. . . Then you have the charcuterie section, followed by the cheese section.. . To finish it off comes the asian food section which includes more foods than I could identify. You have your noodles, sushi, some sort of soup making station, pork buns, fried rice, meat dishes and then some. . . For the cherry on top, make your way to the dessert buffet island in the middle of the floor. There you can stuff your own made to order fresh crepe, order some gelato or pick your favorite small bites of dessert. . . I cannot wait to go back!!! Best part is the new waiting system. You check-in and can then go on your merry way around the casino. The computer system will text you letting you know when it is time to head back to the buffet to be seated. Sure you'll still wait around 15 minutes or so but that's better than an hour or two!
Want to eat like you just hit the jackpot?  Come here.. . It's not cheap.  It's $55 for dinner but it was worth every cent.  Get there early because after 6PM the line gets pretty crazy.. . Excellent quality of food and taste was on point.  King crab legs were in the Italian section and upon request.  You're welcome :). . My one and only con was their molten "lava" cake.  There was no lava.... . Best buffet I've tried on the strip so far.  Wicked Spoon can't touch this.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the long wait times.  This place is most definitely worth the wait! Be sure to cruise and take a look at EVERYTHING before piling up your plate. The biggest and best selection of just about anything u could imagine.
Rated #1 by USA magazine food was great although for the price I felt it should of been a little better and lot more selection. The seafood was just great and fresh, the meat section lamb and steak my favorite. The Asian selection was not enough and the Italian section was really lacking they only had 1 pasta dish where is the rest? . . The dessert was just amazing love everything that alone will come back for :) . . Love the setting and ambience not your average buffet.  . . If you have the money to splurge then go but if not you can go to other  buffets and have more selection.
i'm a marathon eater and vegas buffets are my playground. my current favorite has to be bacchanal. . . i can't tell you every single thing ive eaten at this buffet, but here are a few notables:. - chinese food/dimsum. - tacos. - kobe sliders. - prime rib. - baby lamb chops. - oyster shooters. - made to order ramen, pho, udon. - mochi ice cream. . pros:. - delicious food! oh the delicious delicious food. the endless supply of delicious food. - the new paging system! i was lucky to not have to use it, but apparently the paging system lets you go and gamble and drink without having to wait in line. - the put a bar in! there used to be a fountain next to the line at the front, but the intelligently put a bar in for all the people who are waiting and don't gamble. at least let us drink the time away. - wine list was pretty reasonable. while the wine itself was just okay, the prices were very doable. . . cons:. - price. gone are the days when buffet was a nice $27. yea, dinner is pricey, but it's worth it. for the glutton in all of us. what happens in vegas stays in vegas, even if it's your weight in crab legs, right?. . *tip* if you want to try to avoid the lines, opt for going on sunday, there should be less of a line, and try to go on the early side . . would i go again? yes!
It was worth a try, good selection but the Asian section needs some work. The dim. Sum was dry and not edible. The sushi was something you'd expect from a hole in the wall buffet in your home town. Pad Thai was greasy. The Mexican section was also disgusting. I only stuck with the meat carving area and seafood. Although I had bubble guts all day after eating here. Idk if it was because of the Nasty Asian food I tried or from the oysters. If I am going to pay buku bucks for a buffet, id expect everything to be up to par. At least everything to be edible.
I've been to a lot of Buffets but this beats them all, Hands Down. What first impressed me was that there were Chefs at each station and each station had there own Kitchen. The detail was Incredible. Here are some of the Highlites. Mushroom Truffle Soup, Actually brought a tear to my eye. Smoked Turkey, Best Turkey Ever. Prime Rib, Drool. Shrimp, Perfect. Sushi was Outstanding and actually sweet. The Tuna was so Fresh. Lobster Benedict, Damn. Listen, Everything was Good. Good, No, Great. While it is expensive, it was worth every penny. Oh and go for Breakfast to try the Smoked Orange Pork Belly. Left me Speechless.
Came here on a Saturday around 1pm. To my surprise no line, but wait... They have a new system where you go to a screen touch computer and input your info (name, phone number, and # of ppl in your party); the computer then generates a time for you to come back to pay. Personally, I like this better than waiting in line for over an hour. Pretty smart for the hotel also because while you wait for your time chances are you are playing, so the hotel makes more money. . . We had a party of 9 people and we were given a time for 2:45pm, so over an hour wait. That's pretty typical for this buffet, at least we didn't have to stand waiting in line. They will text 10 mins prior to your  designated time and you just go straight to the hostess and she then directs you to the cashier to pay. We waited about 10 mins to get a table after paying. Not bad! . . For the food... Great selections; definitely better than other buffets on the strip. Make sure you come hungry because there will be plenty of food for you to choose from!
So I come here on my birthday thinking it's the best Buffet in town. (A little pricey for me  )but it's NOT! Well the food was good. The false advertisement took me by surprise. I called the Buffet around 6 pm to make sure they had snow, king and stone crab and the Buffet said they sure did. For $50 per person I thought that was great. So decided to try. Side note I've been going to the Bellagio Buffet for $29 mon - thurs & get a king and snow crab. They have it complete separated. Ok now back to Bacchanal Buffet. I ask the chef at the crab station where the stone crab was and he looked at me like I was crazy. He said we don't have stone crab and the king crab is mixed with the snow crab. It was like looking for a needle in a hay stack. Started out disappointed. Talked to the front person seating guests and they apologized for not having stone and assured me they have not had it or ever had it and that king was not really available. They said "Michelle" the manager on duty would come over to my table and explain. Well "Michelle" never came. The front lady came again to my table & apologized for Michelle not coming and said would have the main dinning restaurant serve me some king crab. So they did. And it was good. But the quality of the king crab was no where near as large or tasteful as the Bellagio Buffet for less money. I'm not coming back here for this price.., rather go elsewhere!
Better than the Wicked Spoon any day anytime !!! Have been here 15 years and have dined everywhere inexpensive/expensive and if you want quality/quanity this is the place to go for a buffet !!
This is really the best buffet I had in Vegas ever. $54+tax it's a bit pricey but it is worth the experience. They have put care in their foods, their foods are authentic and very tasty. The seafoods are fresh, especially the raw oysters. Everything there I wouldn't mind eating. Overall, this place is very good and service is also good.
Went ahead and try the lunch buffet on Friday.  I think this place is overrated and is way over priced. (43 bucks for a lunch buffet)  . . Three things that I like about this place:. . Great Asian Food Selection: Roast Duck, BBQ Pork, Pork Siu Mai, Har Gow, Custard Bun, Noodle Station (Pho, Tonkotsu Ramen (watered down but tasted alright), Udon), Congee with thousand years egg and Chinese Donut. . Taco Station: Carne Asada, Carnitas, Pollo...Don't remember seeing fish taco.. Great selections from the Carving station: Prime Rib, Ham, Brisket, Sausages, Turkey, Pork Ribs.. . They also have fresh oysters and crab legs.. As far as desert goes, Wynn and Bellagio have better selections.  . . My conclusion, if you want more selections on Asian food then, you can come here otherwise, just go to Wynn.  You can get great Asian food elsewhere.
If you don't want to read my crazy long review, then just take one thing away: Go with friends, lots of them!  There are soooo many delicious-looking yummy dishes and desserts to try, and unless you are a black hole, there is no way you can sample them. all yourself!  By splitting everything, we were barely able to sample every dish at the buffet before calling it quits~ :). . The buffet atmosphere is awesome!  The food area is clean and well kept, the floors and vacant tables are spotless, and the design is brightly lit. Bacchanal definitely stole my group of girls' hearts with the dessert area.  Be sure to take a walk around the entire buffet before jumping in line, because the buffet winds around all the way to the back starting with seafood, homestyle American and BBQ, fruits and juices (they have horchata, albeit it being overly sweet), Mexican, (an extremely small area of) Indian and Italian, pizza, charcuterie (think meat plate), cheeses, salads, Thai, sushi, dimsum, and Chinese food. The dessert area is it's own entity in the middle of the establishmentwith petite cakes, cookies, pies, crumbles, macarons, whoopie pies, fruit, and gelato!  My sweet dreams come true :') seems like they continuously make their desserts fresh, so visit this area often because new ones occasionally pop up. . . I actually really dislike buffets because I have no self control =.=' buuuut Bacchanal's lunch buffet was $48, and it was totally worth it for the experience with my friends!  Just looking at the food was fun by itself, and there were a lot of choices that were new to me, like ceviche. It was great, since I could just sample a little ceviche instead of ordering it at a restaurant and risk not liking it.  The buffet comes with bottomless mimosas, and afterwards be sure to enjoy some organic peppermint tea (which helped us soothe our overworked tummies!).  There was some filming going on for what I'm guessing was a Food Network show, so Bacchanal *must* be da bomb, right? . . I highly recommend the miso sea bass from the seafood area!  It's super tender, wonderfully flavored, and is served with bok choy and something that I think was wasabi mashed potatoes. Really interesting flavor mix and oh-so-dang-delicious ^^!  And if you think you see a tea dispenser near the seafood and pizza stations, that's not a tea dispenser. It's melted butter. One of my friends learned the hard way, haha!. . Apparently patrons can stay up to 2 hours, but I'm pretty sure as long as you are still eating and not just camping out to wait for dinner, your group doesn't have to worry about stopping mid-bite. Just FYI, lunch and dinner have the same menu. Our waitress was *the* nicest lady ever and super smiley, yayyy ^^ Don't forget to tip generously-- the wait staff works hard clearing dishes from your feast and making you feel like a king!
THIS PLACE IS HEAVENLY!. . If you're willing to pay the big ticket, you will have no regrets. Now when deciding to come to this place, feel free to make alternate plans for those with you who are nibblers and don't really chow down... it's a waste of money. You're paying for free reign to probably 200+ unique items and tasting only 2-3 of those will not add up to the $40-$70 you'll be spending here.. . With that said... OMG Bacchanal is a food lovers dream. I don't even know where to start but my favorite area was the meat station where they had like 10 cuts of meat and 10 different types of sausages. Shrimp and Grits, Char sui BBQ Pork, sushi, charcuterie, Osso Buco, street tacos, sliders, Pho, and Creme Brulee, to name a fraction of the things they had.. . IF YOU LOVE FOOD, this place is a MUST!
This place is AMAZING ! I went here on Friday night with my boyfriend around 9pm they didn't have a line at all. The girl told us food will serve until they close which was 11PM on a Friday night we said okay lets do this. . . We paid for this buffet along with the 24 hours buffet we had the total reward card so it was a bit cheaper. Total for two on Friday with the 24 hour buffet ( paid $30 extra each for this buffet ) came up to $205 and something cent.. . We were seated had the server took down our drinks. We rush like animals to get food cause they were closing soon. I was surprise they had EVERYTHING still refilled !! . . Prime rib, steak ,. Lamb chop...... Oyster were fresh! Fresh juicy crab legs!! And Kobe beef burger ! What!!!!?? Delish! Also don't forget to check out the dessert place if it's your birthday tell them and they will make you a plate of their choice and write happy bday on it which is nice. When it hit 11pm all the food is put away EXCEPT dessert so yum yum. ( we went clubbing after this ... Yup not a good idea lol )
We had been waiting for a while to try out the revamped Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's. Wonderful selection of higher end food for a Vegas buffet. Oyster's, Lamb, Cold or Steamed Crab legs, Desserts Galore.. . BUT...Here are the issues which made this place lose all its stars.... . 1) We all got some sort of food poisoning from eating there, and it wasn't the meat because there was a vegetarian in our group who had the same result.. . 2) The lamb was inedible. It was rubbery and tough.. . 3) Checking in, we waited in a line for 15 minutes and when we got to the front desk, they said we needed to get back in line in 20 minutes because the line to get in after that line was too long (it was really short so we scratched our heads). The next party was told the same thing, and then everyone behind us was let in, so we in effect were made to wait in 3 lines. We were dressed nicely and we're pretty average looking, so I don't think that was an issue - most folks in Vegas are in shorts and flip flops anyhow.. . 4) The price is more than most of the other Vegas buffets. There's too many good buffets to justify it. Go to the Wynn or Cosmopolitan instead for more expensive buffets or you can hit the 3 1/2 star buffets at the Rio (there's two) for a good buffet.. . Note: Not very good for vegetarians. I saw a Yelp review of the Cosmopolitan Buffet that said there were quite a few vegetarian friendly dishes there.
wicked spoon may have come up with the individual serving idea, but bacchanal executes far better - each dish tastes like it was prepared to order.  the tacos were great and the ramen tasted better than most ramen shops in SF.  great shrimps, carving area with huge selection - like brisket and ribs.  one let down was they ran out of sushi...well, make some more. the ticket line system is cool too. you hold your place in line through a machine and you get a text when you are in front of the line.  so you can gamble while you wait instead of standing in line.  mimosa was also cold which makes it delicious.
You do realize this is buffet, right? There is something to be expected regarding the food quality at a buffet, period. On that scale, I see why this place has been named the #1 buffet by USA Today like 4 years in a row or something? . . The variety is phenomenal. The taste of the food is better than buffet expected, but only if you don't allow yourself to be blinded by how nicely designed and kept the interior is. I do have to note that how incredibly clean they keep this place is pretty spectacular, given the amount of volume going through. . . Some of the food tasted pretty amazing, some of it was meh. Regardless, they keep everything STOCKED to the max (the cold seafood line had me drooling before getting seated) except for the hot crab legs. . . If you have a sweet tooth, you'll be in heaven at the dessert section here. This spot is a Vegas must-try, once.
Definitely the cream of the crop for Vegas Buffets. . . Unparalleled selection, and I mean no other buffet comes close. They had everything here - an extensive dessert selection, all sorts of carved meats including your usual culprits, sports bar food like wings and sliders and tater tots, sushi that was surprisingly decent, a variety of soups including a Chinese chicken ginseng soup that was actually well made, a great raw bar with fresh oysters and not-salty king crab, and the list continues with other various bits of deliciousness.. . You can get a few bucks off with your Total Rewards Card by the way. It's not cheap, but definitely worth going to at least once to try it for the sheer variety. I know I'll definitely be going back here in the future.. . Note: I visited this buffet in August, 2013, so I don't know if anything has changed since then.
You have just been hit by a mack truck while crossing a street and you have unfortunately passed from this world to the next.  The next thing you do is come to in a bountiful buffet with everything your heart could ever desire.  My friend, great news, you aren't dead, you've just been hit so hard by that truck that it knocked you all the way into the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace in Vegas.  However if you didn't know any better after one look at the offerings of this buffet you might think you were in heaven, and that's completely understandable.. . There are buffet options as far as the eye can see, some hidden in the back, and even a huge desert counter in the middle of the place.  You name it and they probably have it at this buffet.  The website says that Bacchanal is like 9 restaurants in one place, and that means I missed 5 of them while I was there.  However, I did stuff my face with quite a bit.... . My first plate had waffles and pancakes.  The next was pizza, some random cheeses, and some pasta primavera.  My last plate was fried chicken, mash potatoes, mac n cheese, and a slider.  When I put my last plate on the table in front of my friends I had no choice but to say out loud "'MERIKA!!!". . . You want to talk about white trash dreams? Well I had mine when I was eating fried chicken and washing it down with champagne.  That's right, on the weekends there's unlimited champagne.  Being the boozers that we are, we even skipped the orange juice and just told them to keep the champagne coming.  They were surprisingly cool with that. . . If you're in Vegas and you can't win big at the slots or the tables, then go here, because with a spread like this, everyone wins.
This is the only buffet on the strip to challenge the Wicked Spoon. The food here is tasteful, however they are beyond stingy with their mimosas (and when you're paying for unlimited, they better taste up to my standards). The overall experience at the buffet was good, however there were a few issues. The host at the cashier stand was not very friendly and the server was asked by the hostess to take two groups to two different tables, he mixed up the tickets numbers and gave the party of 2 that was before us the table we were supposed to have. When he realized his mistake, we had to go back to the front of the wait line and wait another 10min for a table.
48 Dollars and a 20 minute wait should equal the best buffet you'd ever imagine.   But I found it par-for-the-course.   . . Lots of options, but the food was average. . . It turns out the premier Vegas buffet is more hype than substance.
Not as good as all the hype!   Not bad, don't get me wrong,  just not worth $50/person and the number one rating for all buffets in Las Vegas (AKA: buffet town).   Attention to detail and customer service is lacking at this price point.  The high end food options are limited and not that well executed.  I did really like the meat cutting station and the big personality chef working it.
Pretty good. Your average buffet. Long lines, avoid it if you can, not worth the wait. There are better buffets on the strip if you really want to eat in the area. It would be a 3 star restaurant if not for the insanely long wait
EPIC and Perfect (except I took a star off for the wait). . But we love it and we'll be back.. . Its got the smashing dessert collection, expensive seafoods and meats, weird drinks.. . Only place to get unlimited fresh raw oysters that you can trust on the strip.  . . So MUCH VARIETY, you will not know what to do with yourself.  Come hungry, don't waste your tummy on cheap food (even though its good), like rice or whatever.. . Take a look at all the pictures other people took.
The most expensive buffet I've ever been to -- and also the best, by far!. . There are so many options to choose from, whatever you like, you have a good chance of finding it here. The Asian foods were what I enjoyed the most, but there is clearly something for everyone . The Peking Duck is awesome and it's tied with the Wagyu sliders as my favs here. I would pay a lot just to get those two dishes!. . The smoked salmon is first rate, as is the prime rib, brisket, char-shu pork, spare ribs, bao, pad thai, and chow fun. I was so full I didn't even get to try the sushi which looked good too.. . Great dessert bar, I managed to put away some excellent gelato and finished with a pot of Italian roast coffee that was (surprisingly) savory.. . I can not recommend this buffet strongly enough. If price is an issue, go at lunch when it's a bit less. Still pricey, but not a ton more than you'd pay at many other mid-range restaurants. You have to get your own food, but that's a small price to pay. And you get to choose what you want and how much you want. . . I can't wait to go back!
I love this buffet.  We always make a stop here for their Champagne Brunch when we come out to Vegas.  The food is really high quality and you can taste it.  Everything I have eaten here was good and they have a nice variety.  I like the fresh squeezed juices to add to my champagne as well.  I have eaten at the Wicked Spoon, Cravings at the Mirage, and The Wynn Buffet....this one is my favorite.
Bacchanal is rated the #1 buffet in Las Vegas. Having the chance to visit one other buffet that shall remain nameless, I do understand why. Bacchanal is well organized and the food is pretty good. Enjoyed the nice variety. Its nearly impossible to try everything because there is so much to choose from. Overall, I really enjoyed the experience, andwhile it is a little pricey, it was worth the money, and I would encourage you to visit if you were in Vegas.
Great quality and variety.  The lamb chops were terrific and a change from standard buffet food.  Too bad they only give you one at a time, not that I can't use the exercise.    The duck was delicious.  I have eaten a lot of Chinese roast duck in my day, this may have been the tastiest, juiciest I have had.  The beef rib resembled a tomahawk steak - prime rib style.  Really beefy, more like prime rib than bbq rib.  The shrimp was big and juicy.  I am not sure what type of shrimp, but it was much better than the others I have had at LV buffets.  These items I found to be the highlight and difference maker in the other buffets?   Why only 4 stars?  The price is the highest of the top-notch Vegas buffets and can be a deal breaker for some.  If you are not the lamb-duck kind of eater, the Wynn may be a better place for you.  If they had king crab instead of snow, this would make the 5 stars.
2nd time here, this buffet is on the top! Shrimp and Grits, Oyster shooters, crab legs, and check this out, Sinigang too! Yup! Street tacos! Bam! Mochi ice cream too!. I usually come around 2 so I can pay for lunch, and get the dinner spread at 3 pm!
Great food!  Fantastic ceviche, crab legs, prime rib!  Huge selection of desserts and they are awesome!  Worth the money as the food is excellent.
Went here in between lunch and dinner on a Friday afternoon, it was a buffet paradise! There's an endless amount of everything! They have seafood, BBQ, American, Japanese, Chinese and some pasta too! With a vast variety of desserts. The service was good, the place itself was roomy, great for groups. Definitely want to go back next time I'm in Vegas!
This is the best buffet in Vegas. . . What makes is great is the attention to detail. Yes, the major ticket items are delicious (crab legs, prime rib), but what stands out is how delicious the everyday items are. . . The sliders, small, delicate, flavorful. The tacos, as an LA native they get my stamp of approval. . . The other thing that stands out about this buffet is the Asian foods section, from Thai, to Japanese (not just sushi but also ramen), to Chinese (both dim sum and regular dishes) everything is flavorful and to die for. . . Expensive? Yes. Worth it? If you like buffets, absolutely.
After coming to Vegas off and on the last decade and then finally moving here 4 years ago, I've become a bit of an expert on the Vegas AYCE experience.... . Been to the Bachannal Buffet a dozen times now and it is THE BEST BUFFET in Vegas hands down...and I've been to them all multiple times. . . Just to review my last dining experience which was Saturday Night3/22/14.... . PROS. -The best quality/variety of carved meat station on any Las Vegas buffet...delicious, high quality lamb and prime rib and much more. -Hot or cold higher quality king crab than any other buffet (Bellagio, you suck). -Jumbo prawns. -Miso glazed Chilean Seabass with pesto mashed potatoes. -Awesome mushroom truffle soup (not quite Guy Savoy awesome, but awesome). -Shrimp and grits that were just as good as the famous Border Grill at Mandalay. -Truffled Scalloped potatoes. -Sushi if you feel up to a couple pieces (rainbow rolls, etc..). -Higher end meat and cheese station. -Carne asada that I took (sans tortilla) and dunk right into fresh guacamole. Yum!. -Juice bar with around 6 different juices. -The best deserts, fresh crepes and all the mochi ice cream you can handle. -Addicting sweet potato tots, sweet and salty and so good!. -Asian section that I never bother with because I'd rather eat 2 full racks of lamb..or more crab legs. -Awesome peach green tea. -Friendly, personable and helpful food handlers at pretty much every station, people I would look to hire if I had a restaurant. -They rotate dishes in and out some days...I've been here often enough to see new stuff and have stuff I was looking for unavailable..."Hey management: keep the truffle soup and scalloped potatoes on all 7 days please!". . CONS. -The servers can be hit or miss. ...have had excellent service and then sometimes I've had a couple experiences where I do them the favor of not having to give me a drink (and for that matter not having to pay attention to my glass level since I get my own drinks at the new juice bar...). This means the only task they have to do is clear away my dishes...well at a table for 2 this Saturday, we had  2 stacks of 3 empty dirty dishes (6 dirty, empty plates) on top of each other where I couldn't even put another dish with food down because there wasn't any space and I kind of had to look over at one of them, like..."are you serious?". This has probably happened twice out of twelve visits where I've had a relatively MIA waitress, but both times were recent and both times were when the place was really crowded...maybe they can't keep up with the crowd (5pm Saturday night).. Also, we were on dessert for a good 20 minutes and the waitress was clearing plates and not once asked us if we wanted a coffee. Their coffee is good too. I would have taken one but I probably would have had to shit halfway through the drive home.. . . TIPS:. . -I usually splurge and go for dinner...(or pay for the end of lunch and eat slow into the dinner food)...But make sure you go for dinner. You are in Vegas. Experience the best food at the best buffet. Dinner is when the best food is out.. . -Ask for the peach green tea and try juices at the juice bar. . -If you want the HOT crab legs...they are in back near the pasta station not in the front...they'll separate out the king crab if you ask real nicely and they're in the mood.. . -Save room for dessert...just really good spread.. . TO THE BUFFET MANAGEMENT:. I know your prices keep increasing and THAT IS FINE...really...if food costs are going up, please maintain the quality that you've had since the beginning even if it means a little increase here or there. These people come to Vegas and blow thousands of dollars, will pay $22 a drink a club, they will pay for good food on a buffet even if it's expensive...please continue to put out the quality of food that has made you guys special.. . "The 7 Best". Bellagio: Way down hill from 2005. Paris: Was great, now a joke. Wynn: Still Ok, but noticeable cutbacks. M Studio: Way down hill from earlier on. Wicked Spoon: Started great, went downhill fast. Aria: So-so. BACCHANAL BUFFET: AWESOME, PLEASE STAY THAT WAY
There was a 1 1/2 hour wait for the Sunday Champagne brunch which was a little ridiculous, but the check-in kiosk/ text notification made it a tad more bearable. There was someone taking professional pictures of guests in line which I'm guessing you could purchase later as a keychain or coffee mug to remember the experience... We probably waited another 20 minutes after our reservation was called before we actually sat down. The overall selection was decent and the crab Benedict was amazing! I had hoped there would be more breakfast options personally. The bottomless mimosas/ champagne was good but I wish it could have been an optional add on since my husband doesn't drink. It was ~$95 for the two of us which was pretty steep for brunch, but I wanted to check it out since they remodeled. The layout is great and the decor is very minimalist & modern. The food isn't any more special than before. I might go back for dinner if there's no wait and we did good at the tables :-)
First time here. It's pretty good so far.. . This is a very classic looking buffet. It had a great variety of food, and most of it tasted really delicious.. . There were jumbo shrimp and cocktail sauce, which were probably my favorite. They were SO GOOD. Very plump and juicy.. . The downside was that the sushi was AWFUL. It was just very disappointing, because sushi is one of my favorite foods.. . Overall, I think I would come here again, though.
As you read reviews of Bacchanal you will see everything from a 1 rating to a 5 and you may wonder what that is about.  Let me try to explain.  Some people have an expectation that everything must be absolutely perfect and if it isn't, they will find things to bring their rating to a 1.  Others don't have much to compare it to and think it is the best and give it a 5.  Then you have a whole bunch of the rest of us right in the middle.  Those of us that may have been to lots of buffets and brunches, like we have, and really know what we are talking about.  The Bacchanal is one of the best in Las Vegas, for a high end buffet, but it is not perfect.  I say for a high end buffet because you have to compare it to others that are in approximately the same price range.  Don't compare it to something like Circus Circus because they are in a different category.. We dined here on a Sunday at around 11:00 a.m. and the wait was only about 10 min. but it can be very long at prime times.  They do have terminals in front that will tell you approximately how long the wait will be and you can enter your cell number at that time for a reservation and you will be called when you are able to get in.  That way you can wander around or gamble in the casino instead of standing in a line.  Nice feature.. The room is very nice and spread out so you don't feel crowded together.  The food areas for the most part are also spread out.  With one exception and this is a complaint we have with many buffets.  The carving station is placed right in the middle of a line of food which means that lines of people form and block other items of food that are then hard to get at.  Especially if you don't want anything from the carving station.  Sometimes the same is true of an omelet station.  It seems like places would figure it out when they decide to put in a carving or omelet station.. There is a very wide selection of food here so that everyone should be able to find something they like.  Large shrimp and cracked crab legs are plentiful.  Many areas with different types of food.  The dessert area is set in the middle of the room by itself and has many many assorted cookies, cakes, pastries, ice cream, crepe and shave ice.. The overall quality of the food is excellent and not filler food.  BUT.....almost all of the hot food items were just warm to almost room temp. at best!  Maybe it was just at the time we were there.  Most of the items are served in smaller portions on plates or in bowls so there aren't many large inserts of foods.  Perhaps this is why the foods aren't hot?  You are given a finger protector for hot plates,when you pay, but you certainly don't need them.  If the food had been hot, I would probably have given this a 5 instead of a 4.. If you don't mind paying for a higher end buffet, other than the few things I mentioned in my review, you won't be disappointed.  All of the service we had was also very good.  Don't be unkind or demanding and you will always get the good service.  Don't forget to tip!  Even though the people that bring your drinks and take away all your dirty plates don't bring you your food, but they still work hard cleaning up your mess.  They deserve to be tipped.  . There is a sign when you first come in telling you not to pick up and eat food at the serving areas but there will always be slobs, and I use that term loosely, that don't care and will stand there while they eat.  Just can't wait to get back to their tables and they will often spill things on the floor and make a mess.  We all see that kind of thing!  Why not show a little class instead of acting like a pig?
This buffet is like the Kobe Bryant of all buffets minus injuries! . . I am beyond glad, BEYOND , that I get to cross this off my list! You have to go here when you are at Vegas! I think the price is worth it because the food is really high quality! . I loved everything!!! . . And I ate about 3 fresh creme brulee. That is all. Happy me.
Bacchanal is a go buffet when you are Vegas, but it just seems they don't have too many selection on foods for the $$$, but the desserts are really good!
Went on Thanksgiving. Thought it was overrated for the price. We went for the Alaskan King Crab, there there wasn't any. Not sure I'll ever go back.
I am definitely fan!!!  the customer service is great and the idea of never ending amazing good quality food is wonderful!! YOU GET ALL THIS ONCE you get through the 2 hour line... Worth it though if you have the patience to wait.. ** try going at 1 30 because by the time you get through the semi long line at that time it will be 230 and at that time is it lunch still BUT you get lunch price and 30 min later dinner is served  and dinner line is already formed by the time you are paying!(:
This place is spectacular and worth every penny, especially if you go during Mon-Fri it is only $25 for Total Rewards members (which is a pretty cheap meal in Vegas). .  . Highlights were the shrimp and grits, lobster Benedict, smoked mussels, raspberry pancakes, custard mao, lyonnese potatoes, egg fritata, peppered bacon, pork sausage and Belgian waffles. . . Prepare to be uncomfortably full after this experience.
I was so excited to try out Bacchanal for the first time...I was a bit disappointed with my experience.  My mouth was watering after reading these amazing reviews, and once I coerced my friends into going, I left painfully full of mediocre food.. . We went at the end of brunch on a Saturday, so paid a little less than $50 for unlimited mimosas.  That was a plus...I definitely got $50 worth of champagne.. . The seating and the buffet stations were set up nicely in different food types.  I made a bee line for the seafood station, which was probably my favorite aside from the desserts.  They had huge jumbo shrimp, crab legs and oysters.  I would recommend getting the crab legs warm and don't forget the butter!  I enjoyed the miso glazed sea bass and the lobster corn chowder.. . Next, I had to try the carving station.  I tried the prime rib and pork belly...all super salty and dry.  Very disappointed.  Mac and cheese was ok.. . I would stay away from the sushi...sushi rice was not good and it is just filler anyway.  The dim sum station was decent.  Nothing else really stood out to me.. . The dessert station is located in the middle of the restaurant and is filled with delicious gelato, chocolate dipped strawberries (huuugge!), mini-cakes, macarons and other delightful sweets.  . . Personally, I would rather go to Wicked Spoon for brunch since they have bloody marys and an awesome dessert section as well!
best buffet ever. 5/5. . You should to go early or not during peak times or else you will be waiting in lines of +2hrs. Part of the buffet of the buffet promotion, I think its worth it to pay the $25 surcharge as its still beats paying regular price. They have a huge variety of foods from pho, udon, pad thai, ramen, fresher seafood, a vast dessert selection, unlimited mimosas, prime rib, a deep fryer section, creme brulee etc. All the foods were above average and the service was top notch. . . Basically its a must try if you are in vegas. Just try and come early to avoid the frustrating wait times because everyone wants to go here.
I went back to the Bacchanal Buffet again today with my best friend, daughter, and brother. This was my second time coming here and eating at this buffet (first time was last year). I was a bit reluctant because I didn't have a good experience last time plus I was scared to just throw away another $50 in the trash. However, I'm really glad I took the risk to give them a second chance because I didn't leave disappointed. I did leave in pain because I stuffed my face to the point where I thought my stomach was just going to explode!. . Anyway, I have plenty of nice things to say about their food. It is definitely up to par! Everything that I had was absolutely delicious! . . - Salmon nigiri: Delicious! I only got three because the rice will fill you up really fast. . . - Chicken curry: It was pretty good, but my dad makes better curry.. . - Ratatouille: This was the first time I've tried this and it was so yummy! It's basically vegetables with pasta on top, but it was so delicious!. . - Carbonara: Pasta was great. It wasn't overcooked and it wasn't salty.. . - Chicken tacos: I had these with guacamole, onions, lime, & cilantro, and I LOOOOVE these tacos! You can really taste the freshness of the vegetables and the authenticity of the tacos. SO delicious! . . - Horchata, mango juice, and pineapple: Did I mention that they have a juice station in the Mexican food area?! It's not just ANY juice -- It's AGUAS FRESCAS! I got two horachata bottles, haha!. . - Truffle fries: fjadf;jasdlkjf OMG. These were just so freaking amazing. I seriously could eat these all day and could not get tired of it. It wasn't overly salty and the truffles give that beautiful taste to the fries. UGGHHH SO GOOD!. . - Crab legs: I love my crab legs cold AND with butter. Delicious and it was pretty meaty. I love that they're already cut in half for you so you don't have to pick it and fight it just to open and eat it.. . - Oysters: Yummy! I'm so glad that they have oysters. The seafood definitely makes the price you pay for worth it!. . - Oyster shooters: YUM! I would have more if I wasn't so willing to make room for dessert.. . DESSERT: THEY HAVE MACCARONS! ALL. YOU. CAN. EAT. !!!! This place just won my heart. . . SERVICE: They did A LOT better with their service this time. They took the plates off of the tables pretty fast. They refilled my drinks. They were just a lot more attentive than they were the first time I was here. HOWEVER, during the last 30 minutes we were there, we were kind of neglected. NO ONE informed us that our server already left and was done with her shift. We had to ask ourselves. That's the only reason why I deducted a star.. . I can't wait to come here again. Probably not anytime soon because I'm not a rich girl BUT I will be coming here more often!
Had lunch buffet last week. It was a good meal but still disappointed compared to what I paid. Also disappointed that the variety of food is far less than what I expected, maybe because it was lunch, not dinner.
The problem with going to a buffet is that it's a buffet.  While the selection was vast, with foods from all types of cuisines, the quality of the food and cooking in general is mediocre.  The chinese food reminded me of a typical Chinese buffet, the sushi was sloppily made and rice was just bad, the miso marinated sea bass was way overcooked and had a weird texture because of it, the "prime rib" was tough and dry, the lamb chop was overcooked,  the crab legs were still partially frozen, and the oysters made me wonder if I was going to be spending time with the porcelain goddess later that night.    . . In summary, this place is all show and very little substance.  If you want to go somewhere where you can just stuff your face with as many mediocre things as you can, then this is the place for you!  But if you would prefer just a nice meal cooked with skill and thought, accompanied by a nice alcoholic beverage, there are too many good restaurants in Las Vegas to ever even consider going to this buffet, especially for how much this place charges you.
My mouth waters when I think about this place! Such a solid seafood selection and I LOVE oysters! So I spent all my time eating oysters and crab legs.. . Came during a holiday, waited for an hour an a half or more, paid the holiday prices which are steep... But it is a Vegas buffet and definitely one of the more popular. (I would rather spend money on a buffet which is a for sure win than on gambling which... Well a gamble). Located in Caesars palace & almost indistinguishable except for the long lines. Ask for directions! . . The decor is really nice with glass walls and floating lights and this place is a lot bigger than it looks from the line. I would definitely suggest walking through all the buffets sections (there are corners and turns!) before committing. Remember where your table is too! I got confused, but luckily sat right next to the dessert bar which is in the center of the room. . . I love love love the small plates here, especially since I like taking a bite of something and then sharing with friends so I don't waste it. Seafood and meat section are superb! Everything else ranges from "ok I'm not getting that again but still good" to "I'm glad I got to try this! Om nom." . . Save room for dessert... Or dabble in the other sections and go all out for desserts! French macarons to gelato to melt in your mouth chocolate chip cookies. . . Want to gamble, but don't want to lose too much? Come spend your money at this buffet! Worth the wait and $$$.
Impressive for a buffet in Vegas. When I think buffet I think a lot of quantity food with no quality, or all food taste the same after a while. Not this place, this buffet is an experience, everything taste like it came for a decent restaurant. Great seafood selection, the barbecue section has a lot of flavor. Everything is made to order in some areas of the buffet. A little pricey but for the quality of the food is worth it.
The updated buffet has a massive offering.  I have been to several buffets in Vegas and other casinos is this is the best so far.  The seafood station with pre-cracked crab legs was great.  Great selection of quality meats like lamb, ribs, fried chicken, etc.  The Asian station was good as well.  The vast offering doesn't negatively affect the quality.
Not impressed.. . First of all, pricing was weird. I'm a guy and I was with my friend who is a girl. We went in to the buffet just past 3 on a Friday, so basically dinner prices just started. Both of us are total rewards member, but she got charged 49.99 pre-tax and tip and I got charged 54.99. What?. . Secondly, the seafood was not that great even though that's supposedly what set Bacchanal apart from other Vegas buffet places.. . Thirdly, quality of other sections are not worth the price. The dim sum were not very authentic. A lot of the items taste like they've simply been placed under the heat lamp for way too long. This applies to most hot food section actually. The meat at the meat station were either too hard to eat (like dry and hard) or too salty. Dessert station, not impressed either. All the desserts look better than it tastes. Also, com'on, best buffet in VEGAS? I've seen better dessert selection elsewhere, not to mention it's Vegas.. . Things I liked: the taco station, the order-to-make ramen was good but small portion. Order peach iced tea at the beginning of your meal with your server. Best thing ever. You can also get coffee if you need that extra boost to help you through the day.. . Service was overall satisfactory. A decent experience as like "now I know what all the hype is about", but prob won't come back unless my friends really want to go in the future.. . Tip: if you can, try come right before 3, say like 2:30-2:45, this way you can pay for lunch price and enjoy dinner food starting at 3. We wanted to do that, but strip traffic threw us off schedule.
4 star for service, 4 star for food, and 4 star for price. . Service : attentive for buffet and very nice. Cleaned out the plates on point.. . Food: four stars because the variety is amazing but the SALT level is over board, caution if you are on salt restriction. If they just added less salt and let the natural flavors kick in.. . Price is very fair considering the variety . . I think it is most well rounded buffet in Vegas to date.
We arrived at the buffet at 6 pm and we are told there was a 2 hour wait. They instruct us to get a ticket which will guarantee our place in line. The ticket says to come back at 8:05. We come back only to see that we have to wait in another line for another hour and a half. Unbelievable! I've eaten here before and the food is good, but not worth waiting 3-4 hours. So many people had to be turned away. The old fashioned system of waiting in line is still better than this tocket system. Not sure if I will come here again on a weekend.
Didn't even get to try this buffet because their "ticket system" is ridiculous. . . First, they give you a ticket that says come back in 2 hours. So upon return we find out that we have to wait another hour to pay for the food. . . We decide to wait and wait and wait. After the hour, we go up to the cashier and ask how long is the wait to get seated, "average wait time is 45 min." . . We look at the time and see by the time we actually get in the buffet will close in 45 min!!! At this point, we all leave and go to wicked spoon at the Cosmo where it was a 10 min wait and cheaper!. . For Vegas standards, bachannol needs to get it together. Hungry patrons beware!!!
Really pricey (about $70 for dinner on a saturday), but the food is pretty good.. . -SEAFOOD - amazing! raw oysters, mussels, shrimp, crab legs, ceviche, oyster shooters - all delicious! there was also this salmon dish that practically melted in your mouth.. -SUSHI - pretty good. the salmon and tuna nigiri were really fresh.. -MEAT - the lamb was amazing and tender. beef was good, but nothing special. -DESSERT - HUGE selection. the green tea creme brulee was amazing.
This is the best buffet in Vegas. It is way better than Wicked Spoon and they have a lot more variety of food. The quality is a lot better too and service is always good. They have bottomless mimosas too!
This is my all-time favorite buffet in Vegas!. . Although I feel like this visit wasn't as great as the last times, I still love this place!. . They're getting better and more organized with their line system. Before you would wait, and wait, and wait in a long line to get in. Nowadays they have a ticket machine-- input your party info, how many, what type of occasion, your name, and your phone number. Then they give you your estimated wait time by printing out your ticket and they'll also be able to text you when you can go up to the front!. . As to many buffets, Bacchanal has varieties of food to choose from! They're definitely more of the quality! Seafood, like steamed crabs, oysters, different fish dishes ; Meats, like prime rib, beef ribs, baby back ribs, sausages, smoked turkey, lamp chops ; Soups, clam chowder, mushroom truffle soup, chef's special ; Breads ; Mexican ; Asian, like pho, dim sums, fried rice, roasted duck ; Italian, like pizzas, meatballs, pastas ; Fresh Salad Bar ; Cheese and Dried Meats.. And I must not forget their desert bar! Make your own crepes, carrot cake, pandan tiramisu, chocolate cakes, macaroons, pies, AND their ice cream/sorbet section!.  . My favorites are the Wagyu Beef Sliders with their Truffle Potatoes!. . Well worth the price! And a must try!
I went here for my birthday and had an amazing time. Even though I couldnt get to everything, all the food I was able to eat was absolutely delicious. And they have SO much dessert. I was in heaven. The only thing that may be a problem for many people is the price, but I think its really worth it. I will definitely be going again for my next birthday.
As buffets go bacchanal would be hard to beat. The food was good and of course plentiful. I especially liked the cheese station. Deserts were good. . . The biggest downside is the eternal wait to get in.
I have been here 5 times before and loved it . The time before last I felt the quality and cooking was a little off but thought I came on a bad day. My wife and myself went again yesterday and had a repeat experience. Food was not hot at many stations the salads didn't have that artsy style they had before and the ceviche was sour with no real flavor, clams and chorizo  tasted liked over done clams with a can of corn chowder dumped on them . The BBQ server was very rude and when I went to get my meat and then again when I realized the BBQ sauce was not out and I had to ask for some he told me to get in line. My overall experience this time was very poor . I don't think I will be back because for the $160 I paid for 2 people ($30 bucks to skip line) I could go to Wicked Spoon and get better service too.
Normal buffet..... Nothing special except the dessert.. I think i expected too much.. Great service but it didnt worth the price.
I don't even know where to begin.. . No, I mean it. The food was great, the server was friendly and engaged in conversation frequently, and overall, the buffet itself was aesthetically overpowering. I mean that in a good way.. . From the other reviews I've read, the 1-star kind, it seems like they're complaining about the lines and the "inedible" foods. Well, certainly, for a buffet of this caliber, lines are surely to be expected. As for the food quality, either you were half-full or you just had poor taste buds. No offense.. . Prime rib+ Au Jus= Heaven on the taste buds.. . Hope this helped!
I wish I could teleport back to Bacchanal. I would do it six times, once for every hour the $55 price tag allots you.  Guys, it's expensive, but so worth it.  Two giant rooms, filled wall to wall with every delicacy you could possibly want, and it's all done well.  Sigh.. . There's a guy who will make you street tacos.  A guy who will steam your crab legs.  Sliders that I'll remember fondly for the rest of my life.  Lamb chops that melt in your mouth.  A Chinese section.  A Japanese section.  An Italian section.  Pace yourself and get small portions so you can try it all!. . The dessert table gets its own paragraph.  There are ladies who will scoop you gelato.  Perfect creme brulee.  Someone else is cooking crepes to order.  Cupcakes.  Cake pops.  Chocolate covered strawberries.. . If you only eat one meal in Vegas for the duration of your stay, pick Bacchanal!
