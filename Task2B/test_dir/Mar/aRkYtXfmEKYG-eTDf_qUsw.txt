Okay.  Lux has very good coffee and great pastries and food; however, the place is a cluster-#@ck and for that, I give it 3 stars.  I try to avoid this place; however, when I'm meeting a friend who lives in the area it seems like the most viable option.. . The line to get coffee is ridiculous and there is no sense of order whatsoever in the place.  People kind of stand around behind the cash register waiting for their name to be called to get their coffee.  As far as seating is concerned, good luck finding a place to sit down comfortably.  If you find a seat, keep it, don't get up to pee, because someone will take it.. . Lux to me is more of a pick-up joint and not a coffee bar.  Everyone in this joint has a MacBook or MacBook Pro or iPad or iPhone.  Everyone here so desperately tries to be different and unique, but when you walk into the room, all you see are black-rimmed glasses and MacBooks staring at you.  Hipsters trying so desperately to be different, yet they all look the same.. . Listen, I really like the overpriced coffee here, it's delicious, but everything else about the place is annoying.. . Oh yah, parking also sucks, good luck with that too.
Awesome.  Service is friendly, food is good, beverages outstanding.  Always a great place to people-watch too.  :). . See Jake at the bar.  The kid knows what he's doing.
Wonderful.  The coffee is super smooth and fresh.  I had the best vanilla latte of my life here.  They make their own whipped cream in house and will add a spoonful to your latte if you ask and it really pushes the drink over the edge into divine territory.  I love the decor here - a lot of hipster joints have gone for the industrial look and just feel cold (looking at you, Cartel), but this place is more of the woodsy bookshop feel.  It was very packed when I visited but  I still received my order quickly.   The pastries are pretty good too.
To start, I'm anticipating they went for a communal vibe, when designing this place, but it has gone horribly wrong. It is extremely over-crowded, it may have even be a fire hazard. The whole atmosphere was extremely rushed. The counter worker was okay, I wouldn't say friendly. My iced coffee was completely mediocre! The apple cornbread was amazing. Main con was that it was so over crowded, we had to wait for a place to sit, also parking was a chore!
Love, love, Love this place. Great atmosphere and the best coffee i have ever had. trendy place, always busy, open late, variety
My family and I go here every weekend and most weeknights. We absolutely love this place. Great breakfast in the morning and amazing cocktails in the evening. No other place like it.
Not that great of coffee at all. Coming from LA I've had way better. My latte tastes burnt and they take no care or time in presentation.  Ambiance is awesome, I'd come back for a drink but that's about all.
I have been coming to Lux for the past few months. As a recent California transplant, Lux reminds me of home and I enjoy that fact. Obviously the coffee, food, and atmosphere are all fantastic given the posts. . . I came in yesterday and mistakenly left my bose headphones behind. I returned this morning and figured they were long gone. If this were LA they would be long gone. To my surprise when I ordered my coffee and asked the barista if she had seen them, she knew what I was talking about right away and went to get them from the office. I really was not expecting that to happen. There are many reasons to come to Lux.
Disclaimer, this place is fine for what it is designed for - a super trendy place for extremely hip people to chill, socialize and be fabulous.  The music was decent but too loud for me.  Walking in there gave me anxiety because I had no idea where to order, what to order and once I was given the menu I felt extremely rushed.  The drink was just OK, I wish I would have had more of a chance to look at the menu but I just felt like I was in the way.  Once I found a seat I was so uncomfortable I ended up leavingto a different, quieter coffee shop.  I appreciate what the place is and should I have a friend come into town and we just want to go in to grab a drink and chat I may go back but at this time all I need is decent chair, an electric outlet and some good coffee and I'll be good to go.
Love this place morning and night!. . They have some of the most delicious pastries and breakfast, not to mention their lattes! I love to get a honey latte early in the morning. . . Went here the other night for the first time to check out their cocktails and it was a little strange at first to order cocktails without a menu but the staff there ask you what types of drinks you like and then just make something for you. I had two cocktails, one called the grapefruit (the had absolutely no grapefruit in it.. but tasted just like it!) the second cocktail was a mixed berry mojito, both were very tasty. The jalapeno mac was outstanding as well. Can't wait to go back.
Very cozy feel. Quality products. Quiche Lorraine was perfect and oven heated .highly recommend .
Lux addict here. I love this place. Great for dates or just hanging out with friends. I come here for specialty cocktails made by my friends. Just tell them any alcohol you prefer, sweet or savory, and fruit and they'll make you a delicious drink. . . Also, they have the best Mac and cheese in Phoenix. Highly recommended. . . I also love how they use in house artists to design their postcards (that come with your check.) They're great art pieces and I've been collecting them for some time. . . Love this spot.
Remember.. . Remember that feeling when Ariel sang "A Whole New World"?  . . When Aladdin promised Jasmine that he would show her the world?. . When Arnold promised his men in the hit movie, the Predator, that "if it bleeds, we can kill it"?. . This explains how my heart feels when I come here.  I order the Chai Latte, to which the chai is made in store, and I feel as if I have completed the tri-force.  When I order a moscow mule, they are out of mint, and the mixologist says that he has been experimenting with cucumber and cinnamon blend that he highly recommends and all of a sudden I know kung-fu and I see 0's and 1's, I know that I have hit a special place.  . . Lux does what you want it to do.  They bake, cook, saute, brew, and mix everything this world has to offer and the next.  They have a wide assortment of beers, make killer desserts and they dinner menu is varied.  According to Ashley N. (2014), they make the best Mac and Chee which I must confess is mad suspect considering the Tuck Shop winter menu exists in this fair city.  Obey your thirst.. . XOXO,. . ~Mikey. . P.S. Dedicated to a special Cynthia I know.
I spent a blissful 2 hours reading at Lux today - with a delicious yogurt parfait and an almond milk latte!  Comfy couch, good music, and great people watching :-)
Places like this make me wonder why I ever go to Starbucks. Funky, wonderful coffee, nice people and amazing coffee cake make this a must breakfast stop.
Would u like a cup of small frothiness for $4? I was a bit disappointed with what I got. I ordered a small chai tea latte and i believe they forgot the liquid part of the drink. . I have had their mac n cheese with jalapenos and that one was not too bad.   . This place is good for studying, eating and chatting with different rooms to cater to those needs. Opens late too.
I adore this place. The music, the people, the ambiance. It's the perfect place to meet up with a friend or catch up on work. The chai is incredible, as are the baked goods. Pane bianco next door is the cherry on top. :)
Lux almost gave us a reason to move to Phoenix.  We have had breakfast in many cities, including such notable breakfast cities as Berkeley, New York, and our own Somerville, but this has to be the best breakfast place ever.  The woman at the front desk of our hotel recommended Lux the first morning and during our entire stay in Phoenix we never went anyplace else for breakfast.  For starters the place has a great blue-state vibe--definitely not what we expected to find in Arizona.  And then there's the food which was truly amazing, especially the veggie hash with eggs and terrific toast and (another morning) the best oatmeal I've ever had.   The coffee was superb as well.  We never did get there for dinner but we're thinking we may have to return to Phoenix just to have breakfast at Lux.
I do love this place. it is so beautiful with its uniqueness and environment. The drinks are spectacular as well. I just don't really like the  customer service because every time i have been here ( like 5 times) they are always rushed or too busy to answer any questions. I also get a little weirded out by the fact the if you're not a "hipster" ...you know the ones that wear stripes and cardigans with flats or oxfords? lol well they will all just stare at you like "what are you doing here? haha. . ALSO when i first came here i didn't know how to order and what to order...so make sure you grab one of the menus located on the table by the pastries before you get in line to order that is, if it not packed like always. order your drink stand where everyone gathers (super cramped there) wait for your name to be called! If you order food... Thats a whole different story because i don't even know what to do yet.
If you're old enough to remember Cheers! That is the best way to describe Lux on Central. . . This is truly a place where everyone's knows your name. This is a steezy place for all occasions Monday - Sunday. All vibes are welcome young & old. I've met amazing creatives here. People's of all walks of life. I celebrated my 27th birthday here in the reading room & they made great accommodations for me & my large group. I hosted a documentary screening here in the projection room to a large crowed & even had it open to all patrons in the house that night. Lux is absolutely my favorite place to be for all periods of chill. . . The food here for me is an added bonus for me simply because I love the space so much. The atmosphere caters to everyone. I enjoy the unique rotating menu from breakfast to lunch & dinner. Excellent bar & coffee selections. . . This is home away from home.
Every time I'm in the area I always stop by Lux for a latte. Somehow Lux manages to imbue their espresso shots with a roasted marshmallow flavor that's unique and awesome. Sometimes a good latte from Cartel Coffee Lab will have a similar flavor, but I haven't encountered it anywhere else, including from 3rd wave coffee mecca Intelligentsia in LA. The lattes are the main reason I go to Lux; I've sampled some of the baked goods behind the glass display case, and the pies and quiches are quite good but I wouldn't make a special stop just for them.. . I suppose the place is kind of hipster, but I've always found the staff to be very friendly and welcoming when I roll up in my very non-hipster khakis-and-oxford working clothes. Much more welcoming than Press Coffee and Cartel, for sure. Espresso pulls from Lux are also much, much more consistent than either Press or Cartel. A little rearranging of the ordering and pickup area would be welcome - coffees are delivered to the same spot where you order, which leads to traffic jams. But drinks come out relatively quickly so it's not really a big deal.. . There is a lot of seating, but the place is always so hopping that you never know if you'll get a good spot to hang out or not. Worst case, there's a lot of communal tables where you can squeeze in. . . Bottom-line, go if you're a coffee freak seeking the perfect latte like myself. Their lattes absolutely give nothing away to avowed 3rd wave places like Intelligentsia or many others that I've tried. Kick back and enjoy the vibe and pretend you're in downtown SF or Berkeley while sipping the best lattes in town.
Hate to say, this is the worst experience ever, I've been here more then a few times, always getting their biscuits & gravy, eggs over easy. The biscuits were over cooked and the cook must not know egg temps, the last two times the eggs were over cooked and the yolk broken. I'm not saying this is the end of the Lux for me, but I will surely look for a new favorite breakfast place, which saddens me, because I love the staff.
I visited Lux for the first time with a friend for coffee and breakfast. The atmosphere was great! The place has hipster vibe as well. It is also has plenty of space to sit inside and outside. . . The coffee was everything coffee should be. I ate a blackberry orange scone - delicious! . . There's much more to be explored about this place, so I will definitely be back to try out some other things!
