We had a bit of a wait to be seated, but the food was worth it. And I love that they leave a whole pot of coffee at your table, very good!
As always "Breakfast for Champions" with Karla the amazing, attentive & vivacious waitress!!!
We always make it here when in vegas. In fact, it's a big part of why we come. The banana but muffins are to die for and our server Stacie was very attentive!
Love egg & I! The banana muffins are the best. Our server Carole Ann was a sweetheart. She was very attentive and made great suggestions :)
By far, the best breakfast in town! Our server today, Karla, was super attentive, quick, and very nice! I have been a loyal egg & I customer since moving to vegas in October and I have no plans to go anywhere else. Their hot sauce is amazing as well. Egg substitute omelette for the win!
Love this place! Always had the best experience. Today we had the best server Karla. Thank you for another great experience.
Awesome breakfast. Look forward to coming when I am in town. I always get the key largo crepe. Would love one of these in San Jose. Came on a Sunday once and it was packed so plan to wait. Week days are better.
I never expected these kind of breakfast to be any more special than other breakfast shop, but their food is just extraordinarily tasty. I like their egg work newspaper. Very creative and cute, Remember to order their omelet, super awesome!
THE breakfast place! The portions are always large and rarely have I found a breakfast menu with more variety. It's popular for many reasons so there may be a small wait, but the tables get turned over pretty quickly. The staff is always friendly from the hostess through the bussers. Our server, Stacie, was very nice and quick with the food. I work in the food service industry and usually have a very critical-eye when eating out. This place is outstanding!
Loved the Ciabatta Breakfast Sandwich Brad's Scramble Special!  Service was greatand food came in a timely manner.  Jose did great and deserves to meet the Mau5!
Weekend trip to Vegas and I wanted to avoid the strip and hotel restaurant breakfast scene. Yelp recommended this place so the wife and I gave it a try. . Pretty busy for a Monday morning. Were seated within 2 minutes, great. Server was friendly and attentive. Wife had the strawberry cream cheese stuffed french toast...yummy. Very good with a nice sized portion. . I had the corned beef hash. Good stuff, also a nice sized portion. I love corned beef hash and this was homemade. Excellent. Hit the spot. Great food, good service, reasonable prices.. I was not too fond of the location ( I felt it was a bit far) but I wanted to avoid the strip so I guess I shouldn't complain. . The only CON for me was the lack of info on the server's part. I love pancakes, and always have them for breakfast when I dine out. I asked for pancakes instead of toast and was told they could not do that. Okay, no biggie. Not the first place that does this. However, the pancakes were HUGE and 3 came with the order. I barely even touched them because I was almost full from the hash. I was pretty upset that I dropped $6.25 for an order of pancakes that I had less than 1/4 of because of the shear size. I feel the server could've let me know they were huge and given me an option. Service is a big part of the experience when dining out. If I wouldn't have dropped $6.25 on uneaten pancakes our server would've gotten a nicer tip.
Just found this place at random during a stop in Vegas, and now I wish I had one by my home inPA!  The service was excellent, the waitress was so friendly and the food was top-notch delicious. If I was creating a restaurant, this would be the one. I had been unable to decide between a crepe and a waffle when the waitress suggested half a crepe to go with the waffle. Perfect! So delicious and they have a cool concept of a tag on the table that you can flip up when you need service and anyone will come over, managers, busboys whoever. Brilliant concept. I had often thought a call light or something like that should be in most restaurants and they have one. So, five stars for this place only because I can't give them more than five stars. Stop by, you won't be sorry!
Alyssa was a great server today. Cheerful and attentive.  I enjoyed the banana bread French toast, but probably would have preferred something else.  We will be back!
I love this place!!! Best vegetarian eggs Benedict, and I've always had good service.
Stopped in on a Sunday morning after reading the other reviews on Yelp. I was not disappointed! As a vegetarian, I had Kay's special which was delicious, and our waitress Karla was delightful!
I love food the ppl and my fav waitress karla haha if you want a funny waitress to make ur day nothing but laughs shes the waitress. I come here almost everyday possible.
Great place for Sunday brunch.  Good food, fast service. The banana nut bread is delicious. It's busy but they move quickly so the wait isn't that long.
Starting now I'm eating off the strip this place is amazing don't forget to get your banana bread
Really good food and a really great waitress. Our server was fast and prompt. She made sure we had everything we needed before we even had to ask. Thanks Alyssa for the awesome service!
Great food great service! Our server Alyssa went out of her way to make our visit awesome! Great place to eat off the hustle n bustle of the strip with good prices for quantity. Will definitely be back to visit Alyssa!
Our service from Alyssa was awesome! Our food was delicious.  The California club was amazing and cajun fries hit the spot. Alyssa also started us off with the banana nut muffins that really hit the spot. Great service and excellent food. Highly recommend!
I like coming here for the breakfast, and the service is always good:: . Food is usually average, I just don't like Luke warm stuff but it's breakfast so I can't complain:: I'm usually to tired too  ( one eye open) .. . I drink my 50 cups of coffee cause they give me a pot! It's usually so so:: but drinkable--. I guess I really just have to complain about the most simplest thing which is :: H2O:: . Man does it taste like metal or is it just me?? It's horrifying water man:: beware:: . If anyone is awake enough and feels the same would probably give you props if you say something:: . Over all a good in the hood place for some morning grub::
Wow service with a smile! No long waiting the biscuits and gravy are incredible worth the drive for really good coffee too!
Super tasty breakfast spot just off the strip. Their menu is like a newspaper and is a couple pages long so there is something for everyone! Our server, Karla was very friendly and the service is fast!
Delicious breakfast place just  off the strip. Service was super friendly, food was really good and prices we're reasonable. Definitely check them out if you have the chance!
The egg and I is a great place with great food. You can never go wrong eating here. Karla was an awesome server. Very friendly and makes me want to come back again. One of the best places in town.
Karla was our server today, she was right on time w/ her greeting us and was very nice! She was of course wearing green on st. Pattys day and suggested something new which most servers do not.. I tried eggs Benny! Loved it. Thank you Karla, see ya soon
2Nd time eating here today.1st time was great but now i dont think so. My husband ordered chicken fried steak. The gravey tasted very strange. He scraped most of it off & continued 2eat. I ate1/2half of 1 of his hashbrown paties which had some gravey on it . W/in 30 mins i threw up ,w/in 1hr he also did the same & has not stoped all day vomiting.  I finally called & spoke 2a manager, the lady was nice &suggested  i call the operarions manager. I said no . but u need thow that gravey shit away!!
Best breakfast I've had in a long time these guys n gals know what customer service is all about. The French toast is amazing they know how to keep a drink filled, they're fast and all for a reasonable price. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
Egg and I is a great place!! I come here every time in Vegas. The line is pretty long, but it is well worth it. . . I love the omelets, French toast, creeps etc. They have great sauces, which you can take to go :-) . . I especially want to complement Sasha, our server. Great job! She is really fast and got everything out to order. You are the best!  . . See you again next year, Egg and I!!
Stuffed French toast was great but house potatoes could be better (I prefer a hash potato with peppers and onions rather than a dusting of spices).  Service - thanks Jose - was quick even though the place remained jammed during our entire visit. My husband enjoyed his western burrito
So my brother and my best friend and I decided to have breakfast here. Was a bit disappointed that this location doesn't serve alcohol but oh well. So we walk in and request an outside table and were seated in a timely manner. The hostess seated us that had the tip still on the table and I thought that maybe she didn't see so I let her know oh the tip is still on the table and she had a bit of an attitude while telling me the server would grab it. Theserver, Amanda, came over to us and greeted us and we told her what happened. I wasn't that upset but I just thought it was kind of ridiculous. Anyways our server was really great! Bubbly and cute and super friendly. She even sent the manager over after we had told her about the tip thing and they gave us a free round of muffins! I love that! I guess it's company policy they leave the tip on the table due to bussers stealing tips. . . So on to the food. I got what I always do, it's just a platter with potatoes sausage toast and eggs and it's always delicious. My brother got banana but French toast and Biola got regular French toast and it was fricking fantastic.  . . Once again I'd just like to say how amazing our server was! Thanks Amanda! Also I hope you win that trip to Disneyland!
Just moved to Vegas and heard great things about this place. Went for the first time and they offered a delicious banana nut muffin, complimentary, since it was our first time! It was great. . Our food, however, was not. The server said our potatoes were fresh, but they didn't taste nor look fresh. They put wayyyy too much cheese on everything and it completely covered up the taste of everything else. So we decided to give it another try.. Came back on a Saturday morning, had the banana nut muffin that tasted stale, again, way too much cheese and our food took forever! I don't know why I thought this place would use fresher ingredients... Definitely disappointing.
This place is as good as it gets. The best breakfast place in town! Since my first review the water issue has changed. I can find no wrong with this place. I love Egg & I.
I'll preface this review with the fact that I am NOT a breakfast person. I don't love anything about it. Except when I visit the Egg & I. And let me tell you ... it became a weekly event after a while.. . I can't turn down fresh squeezed OJ. This restaurant has delicious OJ. You should try it at least once. I love their menu. They have interesting combinations, like chicken, pesto, and eggs, and delicious twists on common breakfast dishes, like French toast. I love the scrambles the most, and would  often get the veggie scramble sitting atop ranch potatoes. Slather that mound with hot sauce and call it a day. Expect an exhilerating food coma to follow. The portions are big. I also recommend trying their complimentary banana nut muffin at least once. I don't like muffins or bananas, seriously, but I like theirs. Be adventurous, don't order eggs and a side of bacon. Live it up a little.... . Super awesome service. Expect to wait on the weekends for breakfast/brunch, but they have a quick turn-around and great waiters/waitresses. A nice perk to the crowded atmosphere is an egg on the table that you can flip when you require service. On a very busy day it's very helpful to the staff, and don't be afraid to use it! I've always had friendly, impeccable service here ... no complaints. I've brought every out-of-town guest here for breakfast, and we've always left happy. Stop in and give it a try!
Yummy! Muffins, and Karla is the best she really deserves a trip to see Micky Mouse! The portions are large and the price is low, service is great! Perfect combination.
Staci was just great and the food is so worth it. Great prices, everybody working together to help get people in and out. It's a breakfast wonderful
We went here twice on our last visit to Vegas. Overall 4 stars, one visit was earlier Saturday the other was later sunday.. . For our first visit, we went for breakfast. We were immediately seated, no waiting. Wait staff were prompt and friendly, however, not very efficient. I noticed on 4 different occasions of them taking food orders to incorrect tables.. Aside from that the food was awesome. The wife and I both had breakfast skillets, they were cooked perfectly and portions were spot on. We left full and happy!. . For our sunday visit, we showed up closer to 11am. Told the wait was about 25mins, which it was. Staff were friendly and appeared to be much more efficient this visit. The wife ordered breakfast, Chicken Fried Steak and it was very delicious! I had the beef dip, which was average at best. The beef and au jus just didn't have enough flavor and the fries were soggy. So, I'd say 3 stars this visit, close to 5 the first, would be an easy 4 overall.. . On sunday this place was literally a zoo, people packed everywhere, kids screaming/crying, rude people in the parking lot. I'd rx going early to avoid the rush if you are the type of person that gets anxious easily.
