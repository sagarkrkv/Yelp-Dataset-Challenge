I enjoyed the Bellagio.  Service is good.  Rooms are nice.  Casino is nice.  Location is good.  There is really nothing bad to say except that for my money, there are better alternatives.  I do find the decor to be a little outdated but it is the Bellagio.
Bellagio is at the top of my list for Vegas hotels. I've stayed at Bellagio a handful of times and for good reason. The location of Bellagio is in the middle of the strip. It is easy to get around to other casinos without it being a serious trek. Too lazy go to Europe? Just head over here, it looks like a European villa... you even get a view of Paris, just across the strip haha... . . I love the way the hotel looks from the outside, it looks beautiful and is so classic. It just sets the standard and exudes what sexy and luxurious Vegas should be like. The fountain show is one of the nice free attractions on the strip. The seasonal decorations here are amazing. The atrium is a beautiful garden that magically changes with the holidays and they are usually quite imaginative. If you don't know which hotel is Bellagio, just think Ocean's 11 and it is the main casino where most of the shenanigans go down. . . The rooms here are comfortable, clean and spacious. Even though it's been open for quite some many years now, it is still one of the nicest hotels to this day. If you are looking for some serious dining choices, absolutely head over to Bellagio... it's home of some of Las Vegas' Michelin rated spots. One of my favorite Vegas spots, Picasso, is found here. There are also galleries that you can go see here- one of the ones I was able to enjoy was a special Van Gogh one a few years back.  Atthe bakery inside, you can not only enjoy some tasty sweets, but also find the world's largest chocolate fountain. In the newer tower, it has an elevator that takes you directly to the swimming pool area. Once you get to the pool area, you have like 5 pools to decide to take a dip in. Lastly, if you want to have the complete Vegas trip, go get tickets to see Cirque Du Soliel's "O". Absolutely worth it and your mind will be blown with the acts. Overall, really love this place. Can't wait to stay here again. Haven't had a bad experience yet nor do I expect to have one.
Much overdue review. My husband & I stayed here in March 2013 and we loved it. You do pay more to stay here but its totally worth the money. We had a pool view room on the 11th floor I think. We stayed 3 nights. The room was clean and very nicely decorated,  the bed was very comfy. Bathroom was huge and nice tub & shower. If I came to Vegas again I would most definitely stay at this hotel.. . My friends stayed at other "cheaper" hotels like Flamingo & Baileys and they are nothing compared to the high quality hotels, you truly get what you pay for, and for me I rather stay somewhere I feel comfortable and have an awesome experience, like you do here at the Bellagio :)
Up until now, I've always had a favorable experience at the Bellagio, seeing as how my first experience at Vegas (being 21) I won a good sum on a slot machine there leading to my preference for staying at MLife Casinos only.  My last 4 trips to Vegas I have booked only Mlife Casinos.  Recently, on our way back from Los Angeles, my fiancee wanted to stop by Vegas as a spontaneous trip.  We both were excited as we figured a day in Vegas was just what we needed before getting back to the humdrum of working life. . .  We were undecided on the duration as well as where we would stay, but due to my insistence, we both agreed that it would be a Mlife Hotel.  We were having fun stopping by various casinos and hotels and gambling, when I suggested we head over to the Bellagio, hoping for another run in with Lady Luck. . . We perused the tables this time around, and was fascinated by the Big 6 table, where the dealer (Elisabeth) was so friendly in explaining the rules of the game to us.  We started playing and having fun deciding what to bet, etc.  Right around the 20 minute mark, my fiancee was itching for a drink in his hands and spotted the waitress working the tables in our area.  He tried to flag her down, but she waved him off like he was an annoyance.  She haughtily told him that she would come back in a moment to take his order.  That was the first buzzkill.  We figured she was just busy and she would come back as promised, and since we were having so much fun on the Big 6 table with Elisabeth, we decided to stick around and see if she would come back. . . About 15 minutes later, she did come back around dropping off drinks to the table next to us.  After that, she went around the Big 6 table, and IGNORED my fiancee.  He said she made eye contact with him and shuffled quickly away before he could flag her down.  About this time, there was a dealer change from Elisabeth to Tripat.  Tripat was very gracious and could see we were extremely bothered by this waitress who refused to serve my fiancee for no reason.  He reassured that the next time she came around he would flag her down for us.  So we decided to stick around.  . . Having spent a good 45 minutes at this point at the Big 6 table, and running through all our cash on hand, I got up to get more cash at the ATM.  I flagged down another waitress working another area to ask her if she could let the waitress working our area to come by the Big 6 table for my fiancee's drink order.  She not only cut me off mid sentence, she pointedly told me, "I just saw her at that table.  She just went to that table.  I just saw her go to that table."  Speechless, I could only mutter, "Oh, okay. Thanks."  When I went back to my fiancee and asked, he told me no, the waitress NEVER went by our table.  At this point, our experience had gone horribly sour and we left after 10 minutes from when I got money out of the ATM.. . Tripat was very nice and apologized profusely.  He explained that the other waitress didn't work the Big 6 table, but in my opinion, I didn't ask her to come service my fiancee, so what the heck was up with her brusque and dismissive reply?  Is this the example of service at the Bellagio?  At the Big 6 Table alone, my fiancee spent around $200.  With that kind of money, we could have just gone to the local CVS, bought top shelf liquor and gotten better service.  Heck, I had just gotten another $200 out of the ATM and would've probably spent it at that Big 6 table!!. . We go every year to Vegas for my fiancee's birthday, and this year, I was considering heavily the Bellagio for our stay.  After this, my opinion of the Bellagio has been heavily impacted, and definitely will overlook if for other hotels on the strip.. . So just a word of advice.  It's the little things that count, and just because the dude and gal looks like they had come off of the streets in a t-shirt and shorts, we still spend money and spend lots.  All he wanted was a beer, and instead we got crap service.  Go elsewhere for your spending... you'll get a lot more.
Best meal we've had in Vegas! Highly recommend the Very Adult Mac & Cheese! It goes with any entree. Steaks cooked perfectly and Sea Bass melts in your mouth.
One of the best places to stay in Vegas!!! Love the location, the decor, the fountain with the synchronicity of the music that you can hear from the room. The shops are great and the shows that they offer and to me the casino is the best compare to the others. The pool area is huge with different areas and cabanas are great and spacious. Great restaurants and among all of the hotels that I have been I think it is family oriented without kids bothering .... strange but true!!! Love the hotel!!!
Stayed here 2/21-2/23.  The room was nice, quite large with a great bathroom.  We arrived about 8pm Friday night and the woman who checked us in said the hotel was almost sold out and offered to upgrade our regular room to a suite for an extra $200/night.  We had already paid about $260/ night for this room and expected it to be a little more than average.  I was underwhelmed.  We were in the spa tower with no view whatsoever, and our sheets had lots of little holes in them.  The casino was very smokey (and I am a smoker), buffet and room service was good... but I'm sure there are better ones in Vegas.  I did like that everyone wasn't in party mode 24/7. (I am 25, my boyfriend is 33).  We had a nice mix of fun and relaxation.  Over all, the hotel was ok.  Everyone we talked to was friendly, we just expected a little more.
We've stayed here many times and it is always superb. People think that it's expensive - and it can be, but in the off-season, we get deals for $119. a night! Quiet and classy, we always like returning here, especially after being in the noisier hotels. In the summer, the pools are outstanding, and the gym is tops year around.
Overrated, overpriced, and short on luxury.. . Showers:  water randomly ran hot and cold.. Toilets:  can see the need for the power flush, but do we really have to hear every flush near, above, below, and around our room?. Bedding:  no duvet (which in itself is no big) but chintzy blanket sandwiched between low thread count sheets is not luxurious.. Mattress:  very firm and hard. Tissue:  scratchy, thin and definitely not soft (little details count in luxury accommodations). . Seems Vegas is full of high end hotels, the Bellagio is definitely not one.
My husband and I have been going to Vegas 2-3 times a year since we got married out there 10 years ago. Had been extremely loyal to Venetian/Palazzo but their service has slipped and I got fed up with them while trying to book this last trip. We just got back from our trip, 2/28-3/5. We were celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary so I wanted something more than the regular and they didn't want to accommodate us.. . I booked the Bellagio Suite through Mlife. And oh my gosh, it's an amazing suite!!! It was beautiful and immaculately clean. It had 2 full bathrooms in the bedroom plus a powder room off the living room. I wanted something out of the ordinary and I got it!!. . My only minor issues are that the toilets are extremely loud. If one of us got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, we had to use the powder room so we wouldn't wake the other up. And the other issue was the lighting in the bathrooms was not great for putting on makeup. The lighted make up mirror wasn't bright enough and the overall soft lighting in there made it a challenge to put makeup on.. . Housekeeping was great. The room was always cleaned and we even got turndown service every evening. They were also quiet. I never heard their carts banging down the hallways or hear them talking loudly to each other.. . In fact, I never heard anyone in the hallways. It was always so blissfully quiet and serene. A nice change from the busy and loud activity downstairs.. . We were on the 34th floor so we had a nice high view. It was not a strip or fountain view. It overlooked the pool area and that was fine for us. It was more important to me to be in the main tower. . . We had fun in the casino. They have a good selection of slot machines. And there was always someone coming around every few minutes to offer a beverage. Some places you wait forever.. . I really liked the location on the strip. You felt like you were right in the middle of all the action and it was very easy to visit other casinos. We only took a cab once, to get to Mandalay Bay for brunch at Border Grill. We planned on getting a monorail pass as we always do but with this location we discovered we didn't need it. It was easy to walk to the places nearby.. . All in all we were very pleased with our experience at Bellagio and will definitely return.. . I don't know what the regular rooms are like but if you can afford to upgrade to one of the bigger rooms, I highly recommend!!
I really like place, the king size rooms are very nice and spacious!. . We did havetrouble when it came to checking in, we ended up waiting quite some time and there didn't seem to have any lines which I thought was a bit annoying because people kept "cutting" in front, when I had been waiting.. . We ended up getting room service, it was pretty quick and the gentleman who brought us our food was very nice and helpful. I would highly suggest paying in cash, poor guy would have to go back downstairs to use a credit card. . . Another thing that I noticed is that the air conditioning does not get very cold. . . i did wish this place had more "fast food" options or at least places that were opened later in the night.. . I would definitely stay here again.
Terrible customer service!  My family car got broken into, while it was parked at the Bellagio hotel.  When I asked security for help, they shunned me off as if it was no big deal.  The police would not come out to investigate, because in their own words, "We are too busy, this happens too much."  We lost over $2,000 in items within our car.  When I approached Bellagio later about our family's car being broken into and items stolen, they replied with the words along the line of, "We have no knowledge of there ever being any cars being broken into at the Bellagio hotel."  Bellagio is more concerned about their reputation than they are about customer loyalty.  Oh by the way, my family was actually staying at the Bellagio hotel when this happened...what a way to treat your guests!  I will NEVER re-visit the Bellagio hotel again, nor spend a dime, because of how poorly they treat their customers.
Very Disappointed! The size, decor and amenities in the low ceiling room was what you would expect in a mid-range motel. The single sink bath had serious plumbing problems and a broken mirror. Check-in and check-out at the under staffed front desk was chaos. No queue line just a free for all. The common areas were fine, not special, but rough around the edges. The base boards were scuffed and wall edges were chipped. The conservatory was very nice.. . For the first time in a Vegas hotel we were disrespected by staff 3 times. The hype and price do not match the reality.
The Bellagio is a beautiful Casino/Hotel.  Their fountain water display in front is unbelievable.
My husband and I have been staying at the Bellagio for years now and while we still love this hotel, their are some areas that are in need of some serious attention.. . This year we booked the Salon Suite w/fountain view. Room was good sized, plenty of space and we had vies of the Fountains on one side and Caesars on the other. Because we had 2 walls of large windows the noise level was higher than is typical of our past visits, but not outrageous.  While the size and views were good, I am not sure if these suites had been updated along with all the Deluxe rooms? Either way, they are in serious need of change. The furniture is worn and dated, bed was on its last legs (though not uncomfortable), and the lighting in the entire room was seriously lacking. . . We also noticed the hallways looking a bit worn, and food carts were left for very long stretches just sitting there. We even called for ours to be removed and it still sat there all day into the evening before someone took it back. Details :). . The Petrossian is our favorite place to sit, listen to the piano, have a drink, and unwind. Still love it, the familiarity makes it a comfortable place to land, however, they too need some serious touch ups. I think the furniture and chairs are originals and the wear is showing greatly. New cushions on the chairs or just new chairs would go a very long way in solving the issue of dated decor. Also in need of a menu update w/more by the glass wine options. Still, we can't resist either way. . . Love Jean Philippe, but again in need of a change here as well.  Always the same ole menu items and pastry/desserts in the case. The flow is just not that good, and could use some upgrades to the coffee/espresso. For the prices, you should be able to get a good latte or cappuccino at all the coffee bars in the Bellagio (or anywhere on the strip for that matter), but sadly this is not the case. We usually driver way out past the airport on Sunset to Sunrise Coffee for our morning coffee. Best we have been able to find in Vegas.. . Valet is hit or miss, but typically we have no issues with this service. Love the large waiting area and this is where the Wynn really misses  for us. . . Overall, we will be back to the Bellagio. Still the best even with the flaws.
Not worth the price!  The casino reeks of smoke!  You have to walk through it to get most places and you walk right through lots of smoke!  Very noisy!  They clean the pool area at 5 am, so you hear machines for several hours! The buffet was not good.  The eggs Benedict tasted okay but it was cold.  The other food really had no taste.
The drudgery of the corporate Machine. So basically at the Bellagio in the pit everyone hates upper management.  They all are disgusted by the stupid policies the crappy treatment and the shitty benefits.  The company made the worst mistake in the history of US construction.  (City Center) and they are billions in debt but the upper echelon continues to pay themselves bonuses.  The front line worker is just a cog in the big machine.  They waste money, they cut a nickel and lose a dollar.  It is so poorly managed that most of the old time customers long for the days of the mob run casinos.  At least these guys knew how to treat people.  They were neighborhood guys with big hearts looking to make a buck and feed their family.  So they skimmed a little.  So a few people got killed or beat up.  What the current corporate structure does is loot the place at the expense of the shareholder.  Jim Murren is the leader of a band of ivy league educated fools.  guys who dont know the first thing about dealing with a pissed off cuatomer.  The only thing they care about is preserving their job and bonus.  Here is a good stock tip for ya.  Short MGM it is behemoth that is going to crumble...destined to fail.  The door will never shut because it is "too big to close" but it will be broken up and reorganized.  This I guaruntee and all the corporate turds running the show will all be looking for jobs.   (as well as Harrah's)  The small operator like Seth Schoor and Derek Stevens will bury them.  http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=As6E5YRO_osw4sby94MvsOGiuYdG;_ylu=X3oDMTBxdGVyNzJxBHNlYwNVSCAzIERlc2t0b3AgU2VhcmNoIDEx;_ylg=X3oDMTBsdWsyY2FpBGxhbmcDZW4tVVMEcHQDMgR0ZXN0Aw--;_ylv=3?uhb=uhb2&fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs&type=2button&s=mgm. .

This has to be one of the best hotels in Las Vegas. Situated in the middle of the Vegas strip, it's a simple walk to other attractions on the strip. The hotel has beautiful rooms, large casino area, all year round heated pool, and what I consider the best buffet in Vegas!!! When staying in Vegas this has been my first choice plenty of times. For the price spent, you certainly get a memorable hotel experience at the Bellagio. Check it out.
I'll give it an extra star for the awesome deal they had online.  The room was priced better than my other Vegas favorites, and had a $100 food credit.  Yup, that works.. . Check in on a Friday is a bit of a hot mess.  They have a ton of windows open, but there is no real organization, and although the lines for each window look short, you can still wait for well over 20-30 minutes.  When we finally got to our representative, he did little to personalize the check in process and was very robotic.  . . They've done a good job with keeping the rooms modern after all these years.  We did have a leaky shower upon check in, but maintenance was quick to send someone and had it fixed in under an hour.  At the Cosmopolitan, maintenance service can take all night.  . We were placed in the tower far from the lobby, located well past the observatory.  The walk seemed like an eternity in 3 inch heels, so plan accordingly.  If you want to be close to the action, make sure you ask for the main tower off the casino.. . The rooms were a bit larger than expected for a standard room, and that's always a plus.  The beds were comfy and the bathroom had all the usual perks.  Nothing far superior for Vegas, but still a decent room for the price.  . . There are plenty of specialized restaurants, a 24 hr cafe with decent food, the Bellagio Buffet is amazing, and a few quick bite eateries that I didn't see or visit.  It's definitely not a hotel for kids, so try another hotel if you're planning on bringing the littles.
this placer fails fails on every level. . 1) Check in took an hour - the systems were down - was a glass of water offered to the line of "invited guests" ? no of course not - good thing I wasn't traveling all day.. 2) prepaid for a room with a view - that didn't happen. 3) The marble floor in the lobby was wet - nearly broke my neck - no one seemed to care less.. 4) The people here are all trailer park white or ghetto back . I am paying over 300 a night - what a joke
Well my husband and I haven't left the hotel yet, but I had to write a review. I love, love, love this hotel. There is not one thing negative to say about this beautiful hotel. Lovely room and it was very quiet and clean. Bed was very comfortable. I want to live here. They have everything you could ever want right here in the hotel. . The most impressive thing was that every person we came into contact with in the hotel was very nice and polite, from the front desk all the way to the housekeepers. . Thank you Bellagio for a wonderful 3 days. We will be back!!!!!
It's a beautiful establishment, the conservatory is worth checking out, and it's a great spot to step away from the gambling, and smoke filled casino floor and get some fresh air and take a few moments to regroup.. . The gaming is mid to high priced, lots of bigger minimum bets required so for those that are on a budget you may want to avoid this place.  However if money isn't a concern i'd recommend it.  I strictly play at table games, and I hung out at the $100 minimum table for a while and was on a vicious winning streak.  So as we all know, don't bet more than you can afford to lose, but also don't be afraid to go in on a big limit table.. . I was only at this establishment for a hit and run, but all my experiences here have been top notch!
From the valet greeting when driving up, to the back-to-reality of checking out, Bellagio is a lovely, wonderful, elegant, first class experience. Been there for work, for play, for conferences, for the poker room, for the buffet. WHENEVER I'm in VEGA$ I always spend time, and money, at Bellagio. PS No matter where I'm staying in the 89109 I always hit Bellagio Buffet - always, no exception - period.
