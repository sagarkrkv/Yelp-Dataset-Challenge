This past Valentine's Day was my first time here and I loved it!. . Unfortunately, I don't think I'd be able to spend an entire weekend down here since it seems like all there is to dois gamble, drink and go zip-lining. I would have liked to see a bar/lounge/club here or have the option of seeing a show.. . Regardless, the crowd is a lot more relaxed and chill here. It seems like it is an older crowd so people don't get AS rowdy here as opposed to the strip.. . It's great seeing where Vegas really got started and being able to enjoy cheap slots/tables and even some slots that still give out coins instead of vouchers!. . There's a lot going on here at night with small shows outside, music blasting, people wearing weird costumes and all, but the strip is just a little too small.. . It is definitely a must see at least once in your life.
Fun and different, this is a good break from the Strip. Home of The Heart Attack Grille - you gotta see this - and a zillion little shops, kiosks, and bars. Lots of other quirky stuff to see and do, and the people-watching is tops. Don't miss the light show at night, and watch for bums and pickpockets - yes, it's that kind of area.
Staying at the golden nugget for my birthday and was able to experience the experience lol ... Awesome!!! Glad I didn't stay on the strip was apart of this every night!!! Everything you need is right there!! Liquor, food, entertainment, walgreens, etc...
I love Fremont. If you've never been, it's a must try Atleast once. There's never a dull moment here. From weirdo-watching, to cheap booze, to deep fried Oreos, zip lining, and of course the light shows (The Doors being my fave), street performers, crackheads running a muck, wasted girls falling around showing cooch, drunken Santa Claus. God, I can go on forever.
Its fun first time, and always a SIGHT second and beyond times.   I like it , but it is SO VEGAS, it makes me a little embarrased and sick sometimes.  The spectical of the street performers is interesting, but the homeless guys on the streets are an interesting addition.  Mark this, they are not obnoxious, and these are the good guys, keeping there shit together down there, but they are there still, plus like 10000 tourist day and night, its cool, I love drinking beers watching street shows, and rock concerts on the experience, plus the huge zipline is a great attraction for thrill seekers.   I like the 1 Yard COCKTAILS hanging off everyones neck too, but I ususally and in and out of that craziness.  But have at it, it could be 5 star drunkeness for you...get some!
This place seems pretty cool. I went during the day so it wasn't has busy although it was St. Patrick's Day so there was still stuff going on.. . Some of the street vendors are super aggressive. They reel you in, make you wait while they give you their spiel, then walk you directly to the credit card machine without even asking if you want to purchase their items. Don't be fooled!. . The crazies are a little more concerning. I walked across the path of one of these crazies. He was shuffling along like a zombie. I didn't cut him off by any stretch but when I got in front, he accelerated into me and tried to knock me down. He looked like one of those guys who had been beaten up by life repeatedly and didn't care anymore. Good thing I have a low centre of gravity or I'd have been knocked on my ass. In any case, it didn't seem worth making something of this incident so I just glared at him while he shuffled away.
My husband and I were here from March 11th through March 18th for vacation and were staying at the Golden Gate, which opens out onto the far corner of FSE, so it was pretty much impossible to miss.  . . If you like to party, if you love crowds and loud noises, if you adore people-watching, this is your spot to be in.  Forget the Strip - it's plastic and not at all representative of the old-school style Las Vegas.  This is raw, real, live action right in front of your face.  Some of the old classics here such as Binion's, the "Vegas Vic" sign, it's all here at FSE.  They still do the light and sound show every hour on the hour once it turns dark, and while it's semi-interesting, it's not something that'll hold your attention maybe more than once or twice.  . . There are definitely people hanging around here that you want to steer clear of.  Lots of homeless in this area, cadging from the tourists (which, when you think about it, is a pretty smart move, as they know where the money is).  This is NOT an area that you want to get drunk and lose control in, though people do exactly that here.  There are also many folk that would be pretty at-home in a "People of Walmart" shoot - think guys wearing a little less than Speedo suits.  NOT a family-friendly atmosphere by any means.. . Watch out for the constant barrage of people offering you show tickets, drinks, etc.  As someone else stated, VERY pugnacious and refuse to give up.  My trick was to tell them, "I'm leaving tonight", even though it was only my second day.  How are they going to argue with that?  Barring that, just walk away - there's too many other marks for them to chase down to bother with you.. . Don't let all of this worry you, though.  There is a LOT of security around, especially in front of the casinos.  LV police are also pretty on point with crowd control and hauling the troublemakers downtown. . . I'm only giving it three stars because I just don't like crowds or very loud places or having to scream to be heard.  Otherwise, I'd probably have enjoyed myself a lot more, as this place does have its charm.  I wouldn't recommend taking the kids here, however - this is a place for singles, or young married couples, I think.  . . We'd come again, but probably during the day when it's a little quieter.
Just gross.. Go to experience some epic people watching, maybe stick around for the light show, and then go immediately back to the strip. Talk about a hot mess. Second-rate go-go dancers, dirty smokey casinos, and cracked out bums are abundant. People trying to sell you crap at every turn. No decent places to eat or shop. The only plus might be if you are a gambler, you might find a better deal than on the strip.. . I can't believe people brought their kids here, seriously. I checked seeing old Vegas off of my list, and now I don't ever have to go back...THANK GOD.
I don't understand why people write that this part of town is sketchy. It didn't seem sketchy to me. I went with a couple locals, and they said that parts of Fremont street have the bars where locals hang out. We walked by some of them, and I agreed - they look nice! Loved the kids park behind the preying mantis sculpture that shoots fire. The giant video screen over the Experience was impressive in a cheesy 80s music way. The street performers were really entertaining. It was worth leaving the strip to go to this.
Must-see if you visit vegas. Honestly, I prefer the FSE over the main strip. It feels flashier, louder, and the casinos are smaller and comfier.. . Nice selection of bars along the FSE strip for all the drinks you want. Prices are a lot more reasonable than the main strip as well.. . I recommend going.
I absolutely love the Fremont Street Experience and have been frequenting it since 2007. Great entertainment, food, drinks, light shows. Fun for all ages. I take my children often and they have a blast every time.
