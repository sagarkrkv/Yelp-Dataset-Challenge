We booked 14 rooms for a wedding.  The rooms were great, the restaurants were great.  Because we aren't "high rollers"  or members of the players we were not treated very well at times.  My daughter got married at The Historic Fifth Street School on March 1, 2014.  It is barely 2 blocks from The Golden Nugget.  We asked for a limo to take the wedding party to the venue.  I spoke to 4 people and was told by each one that they would not provide limo service (in the middle of the day on Saturday) because we aren't members of their players club and are not high rollers.  We are, however, locals.  This is how you treat locals? . . After the wedding we asked them to send a car or limo over to pick up the bride and groom, they refused.  We have charges  to our charge card that aren't ours.  When a guest arrived they were asked to pay for one of the nights we had pre-paid.  . . Customer service is lacking in some areas.  The valet guys were great. Many of the employees don't speak English, makes it hard for them to answer questions.. . If you are a "high roller" this is a great place for you.  If you aren't you will be treated like a second class citizen.  Go to the strip, you can do better than this place.. . We used local businesses for every part of the wedding.  The Golden Nugget was the only business that did not treat us well.
this yelp is for the faboulous cocktail waitress bella who does a fantastic job...within a few minutes of my family and i having a seat at some machines (they paid out as well) bella arrives to save the night, she had the drinks coming one right after another ---of course we also tipped her everytime (huge reminder to those who do not tip---always tip the waitress/server) need less to say we all walked out winners and bella had me feeling tipsy.. thanks again bella ur the best !!
The Nugget is a totally decent option when staying in Vegas, especially, if like me, you've seen enough of the Strip for one lifetime.  I love Fremont Street (the lights!  the colours!  The vintage signs!  The pancakes at Dupars!) . . Rooms at the Nugget can be had for under 75 dollars on low season weekdays. Our rooms were about 50 bucks a night when we stayed in early September, which was fine and dandy for the quality of the rooms.  We stayed in the old Carson Tower:  The room was quite large by Vegas standards with a view of the pool area and Fremont street.  Beds were big and comfy and the air con worked.  Yes, the fixtures were a bit old and we experience some problems with the lamp lighting, but that's to be expected at that price.  We didn't eat at the Nugget because there were plenty of good, affordable options around (pancakes!) Weather wasn't great so we only used the pool twice.  The slide through the shark tank is super fun but in general the pool area is disappointing.  It's overshadowed by buildings most of the day, with the few sunny spots all taken up.  The main pool is cloudy and filled with kids while the hot tup is full of skeevy looking folk necking coronas.  . . If you're looking for class, you ain't going to find it at the Nugget, but if you're looking for a cheap, comfortable place to crash, it does the trick.
I've stayed in this hotel in various towers for over 10 years. I think the price and location cannot be beat. This was the first year the front desk was nice at check in and I keep coming back. That shows you how much the hotel has to offer. The pool is wonderful and not too big like the mega hotels on the strip. We used Priceline this time and that added a great deal to our savings. Stay and play as a family, couple or girls weekend.
Nice hotel outside. Pool is really nice. Casino is nice but the layout is so confusing. Checkin was so confusing. The tower you book your room is where you checkin. When we finally found our tower, the checkin was closed so we had to walk back to the front and checkin.. . Room was horrible. I thought someone was staying in my room. The iron board was still out, an empty of water was on the desk, 2 of the Lamps didn't work. My room was next to the elevator and you can hear the elevators in the elevator shaft. The elevator closest to my room, you can hear the door open and people getting in and out. Not my idea of a nice hotel.
Initially booked a room at Golden Gate but they were overbooked and walked us over to Golden Nugget next door. Funny thing is before they walked us they said that they would waive all of the resort fees. When we walked over and asked Golden Nugget front desk to confirm they'd waive the fees, they said they never had resort fees to begin with! Haha. . . As far as the hotel, it's a good place to stay if you have kids! There's a swimming pool in the middle of the casino that the kids can hang out in while the adults gamble or drink on Fremont street. The standard rooms are nice. This particular night we stayed in the Carson Tower and it was somewhat of a long walk to our room since there are so many rooms in the casino. I personally have seen the suites in golden nugget and it's a great place to stay if you're looking to book a night with a bunch of friends.
The shark tank was neat the pool is basically a small very small lazy river, it's no surprise that it's crapy lifeguards letting kids act out, throwing hard rubber balls around one hitting my daughter pissed me off I was done! The room was dirty hair and food pieces left around, all around look at the pool and that's all
We just went to the golden nugget for St Pattys Day and upgraded to the Rush room.  It was a nice room but right outside our window was the stage, with music that gets louder as the night goes on.  I know, your not supposed to stay in your room in Vegas but when you start a pub crawl early, you want to go to bed early.  So, word to the wise, if you want some sleep do not upgrade your room....
Called few days in advance and asked if non-guests could use the pool.  Sure the lady said for $20 a person.  No problem and even told her what day we would be there and that we would be there before noon.  Got there and was told it's $175 for non-guests to use the pool...OMG!!  After being there and seeing the state of the place and how gross and crowded it was so happy I didn't bother with their pool.
Pretty nice hotel. Wasn't expecting much when we walked in but was pleasantly surprised. My gf and I may even stay here in the future.
