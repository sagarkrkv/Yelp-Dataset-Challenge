Great Prime Rib and crab legs - everything else average.  Ask your server for hot crab legs if you want them.  She brought out a huge platter and they were piping hot! We had a Groupon for 2 dinner buffets and unlimited drinks.  I would suggest not buying the unlimited drink option separately as you probably will get too full to make it worthwhile.  Wait in line was 30 min. on a Thursday eve at 8 pm.
Oooh! Looks like I'm review #1,000!. . My boyfriend and I came across a Groupon for Spice Market and decided to purchase the buffet option. For $43, two people get all-you-can-eat-and-drink (including beer, wine and champagne) brunch. There are also breakfast and lunch options for weekdays but the dinner choice is currently sold out.. . I'm giving Spice Market four stars based on the alcohol (bottomless mimosas...hell yea!) and the incredible dessert station. The rest of the buffet was decent but probably three stars at best. . . Things I loved: . . The cupcake selection was phenomenal! There must have been about 12 different varieties of fancy cupcakes. I tried four (cookies and cream, chocolate mint, caramel apple and smores) and, like a little piggy, almost ate all of those four cupcakes. My personal favorite was the chocolate mint (super creamy mint frosting) but all four of them were incredible. If only I had more room in my belly!. . The prime rib was great! Perfectly cooked and tasted like perfection when dipped in the au jus. I enjoyed two slices of the tender meat.. . The mac and cheese was surprisingly good. I've tried it at other buffets and always find it to be bland but here is was perfectly seasoned and I even went back for seconds. The chicken pesto pasta from the Italian bar was also a tasty dish.. . Things I Didn't Love:. . The fresh-sliced turkey was dry and the gravy had a funny taste to it. I love turkey and gravy so this was big disappointment.. . The salad bar was very tiny. I know that not a lot of people go for salad at a buffet but I always like a little salad to go with my meal. I guess it makes me feel slightly healthier while gorging on all the deliciousness. But there were very few toppings and the ranch was not to my liking (I'm very particular about the ranch dressing at restaurants). . . The mashed potatoes, which I admit that I didn't even try, looked incredibly runny and strangely yellow. What happened to fluffy white potatoes? . . One other quick note, if you have a group of 8 or more, they charge you a mandatory 18% gratuity. We, of course, had exactly eight people. I think this is crap as it is a buffet and they're not really doing much for us aside from pushing a couple tables together. And if we had seven instead of eight, they wouldn't charge us? Seems a bit ridiculous!
The worst buffet I think I have ever been to. I walked in, saw the food, then walked out. The food looked disgusting. I tried to taste the tandoori chicken, and it tasted worst than it looked. Do not come here, you will be disappointed.
This place was OK, they definitely have a good assortment of food.. . During a trip to Las Vegas last year in Nov. we did the buffet of buffets and we tried this place out. It was good. The thing I liked the most was their cupcakes, I was amazed at how many different kinds they had.
This buffet is one of the worst I've had in Vegas.  The line, or should I say lines (yes multiple lines) were extremely long and stuffy.  My wait in the first line was 40 minutes, then I paid and had to get in another line for 15 more minutes. . . Once I made it into the buffet I was sadly disappointed about the quality of food and the lack of options at the food stations.  Most of the food looked and tasted like it was sitting out a long time and/ or highly picked over.  If you wanted prime rib you typically had to wait yet again in line to get a slice. . . I was excited to hit the dessert station with it's many cupcake options but was almost crying over my extremely dry red velvet cupcake.  The best cupcake I tried was the cannoli cupcake.. . The only nice things I can say about this buffet is the price is low-ish and they serve beer and wine.  Otherwise I'd recommend hitting up Mandalay Bay or the Rio buffet for better quality, freshness, and options of food - just as  a buffet should be!
This is not the buffet to choose when you are in Vegas.  This place is too expensive and the quality of food is not on the same level as most major casino buffets.  The only thing that was decent about the buffet was the desserts, especially their cupcakes.  The only reason we went here is they had two-for-one Groupon deals and they gave us unlimited alcoholic drinks.  . . We were surprised that if you go with a group of eight or more you have to pay an 18% gratuity fee.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was a sit down restaurant, but a buffet, that is crap.  The service was surprisingly very good (it better be for 18% gratuity) and our waitress was very nice.  They kept our mimosas filled and full beers on the table.. . The food here was not the best, but not the worst.  I tried just about everything there but could find anything I really enjoyed.  They had  all sorts of different ethnic stations with a good variety of food, but none of it stood out as being delicious.  Just one step up from cafeteria food. I was told the mac n cheese was very good and so was the prime rib. They finally brought the crab legs out around 3 pm, but were still mostly frozen and they didn't have anyone to warm them up so you had to eat them cold.  . . If you are trying to save some money and find the Groupon deal then this is a great place, other than that don't waste your money on this buffet.  There is a lot better and cheaper ones around.
45 minute wait inline? Really??? Seriously? Ridiculous!!. . There were lots of tables either open or needing to be bussed and that line would have moved a LOT better.
I love the 2 star descriptor "Meh. I've experienced better." That is exactly my experience with Spice Market. The best thing there was the cupcakes.. everything else was just average. I felt like it was an "around the world" Hometown Buffet. I wish I had taken the Yelp reviews more seriously, they looked mixed and I know why now. The Buffet we did at the Rio was much better and seemed fresher.
Only coming here with a "Groupon" we ate for $43 which doesn't include sales tax by the way but does include all you can drink beer, wine, and champagne. Choosing the dinner option we arrived on March 11 around 8:30pm which was shockingly busy for a week day. We stood inline for nearly 45 minutes which we thought was a bit crazy. Slightly after 9pm we were seated. The waitress was nice enough and offered us the wine by bringing practically the entire bottle and even offered to bring us different ones if we wished but failed to ask or offer that the crab legs can be heated as I ate 3 plates of the cold. No biggie but it took another guest to point it out to me.  . The crab and shrimp cocktail were very good. Also I really liked the salad wedgie with bacon and blue cheese dressing. Thought it was a bit silly to just put 1 fried chicken breast into a basket though. Maybe add fries or something to it. My partner seemed to enjoy the Mediterranean section. The cupcakes were nice and all and many types to choose from but were very very dry and a bit tasteless. I ended up just eating the frosting tops off just to taste the flavor of each one I tried. The cotton was odd but was actually more tasty than the cupcakes. Sadly If I had to pay full price for this buffet I would be way more upset and its not worth it but for half off its not bad.
My boyfriend and I came across this deal on groupon and because it said voted best buffet in Vegas we decided why not. We got there and we were in line 45min just to pay. The food was beyond bland no flavor on anything at all. I would never go back or recommend anyone to go ever! The groupon deal was only sort it because it was all you can drink beer, wine and champagne.
We were staying at Planet Hoolywood so we decided to try this place. It actually is pretty good but this place is touted as the # 1 buffet in LV and it's not that. With the Harrahs card, we got the cost down to under $20 and the choices are really good. They had a crab stuffed sole that was as good as any restaurant. My sister-in-law purch a Groupon thing so we ate very reasonably. . . The creme brulee is delicious and so was the flan. They had a dozen or so cup cakes, cotton candy plus a bunch of other stuff.. . I read that some people waited over 40 minutes to eat. I think I would have been pissed and given them a lower grade but as for the food to dollar value it is very good. If you see a line, go somewhere else.
If I could give it 4.5 stars I would...lets get the bad stuff out of the way... the sushi wasn't the greatest, but meh nothing to cry over. Now the amazing stuff. OMG their Middle Eastern selection! the babaganoush was amazing (according to my boyfriend who is ME) my first time trying and i loved it. The lamb vegetables and couscous YUMMY! Mexican selection was fantastic! was not expecting to see elotes (mexican corn on the cob street style) very authentic tasting, and the tacos al pastor also amazing. The desert section was great tbh i had two cupcakes but only ate the tops since the rest of the cupcake seemed like a waste of calories since it was dry... overall amazing buffet highly recommend for lunch...breakfast not so much :D
