As a GM of a Bar/Restaurant it was a delight to see my Bartender have passion forBobby Q's. When  asking the different questions about the menu she was right in it and gave great detail. I truly believed that she knew what she was saying! Thank you Ciara for your great personality. Even the other waitress kept asking me, "Isn't she the greatest?", yes she was!
We ate dinner at Bobby Q based on their wonderful Yelp reviews.   We had Stacie as our server.   We wanted ribs and brisket.   Based on her recommendation we had a three meat combination plate - with brisket, St. Louis style ribs, and baby back ribs.   The best meat of the three was the baby back ribs.   The baby backs were cooked to perfection, with the meat falling off the bones.   The baby backs were delicious and wonderful.   The other meats - brisket and St. Louis Style ribs - were also very, very good.. . The service was excellent - prompt, courteous, and attentive.   The atmosphere was very relaxing, and tables were spaced nicely so that we didn't feel cramped.   Stacie's service was excellent.. . We will return here when we next visit Phoenix.
A coworker of mine highly recommended this place last year when I told him I was headed out to Tempe for spring training. I didn't get a chance to come last year but I made it a point to check it out this year. I was able to make a same day reservation for Saturday evening through the yelp app and I'm so glad I did because the wait was going to be about an hour otherwise. We waited less than 10 minutes to be seated. . . Our server Tiffany was great, we told her it was our first time so she took the time to give us history on the restaurantand she gave us her recommendations. The corn bread was so yummy and moist. My fiance and I shared the whole hog heaven, which comes with two meats, two ribs and 3 sides. For $40 not bad at all, we didn't finish our ribs and meat (there was a lot for two.) The sides could have been a little bigger, we devoured the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and flavorful. . . I usually prefer baby back ribs over the St. Louis but in this case we agreed the St. Louis were better. The pulled chicken was my favorite, it wasn't the typical chicken covered in bbq sauce. It had some other flavor I can't describe but it was amazing! We walked out of here stuffed, I almost needed to be carried out. The home made donuts at the end were a nice touch, even though I was full I couldn't stop eating them because they were so light/fluffy and bite size. Definitely took advantage of the 10% for checking in. Saved us 10 bucks, I'll take it!! I'll be back next year when I'm in town.
BBQ restaurants can sometimes be overwhelming with all the choices. Luckily we were sent the one and only Chelsea as our server! She clearly has enthusiasm for her job and an outstanding attitude. She was on point for all three parts of our meal. The brisket was delicious. If I could have, I would have ordered all burnt ends. The meat was juicy and tender. The babyback ribs, flavorful and moist. The appetizer course would have been a great main course. The Q rolls were like brisket lumpia with BBQ sauce or chipotle mayo. The apple cobbler for dessert was just the right combo of sweet and tart. 3for3. Either Chelsea is lucky or she's a Bobby Q's savant. I'd go with the latter.
My wife and I really enjoyed this place.  There was a great buzz and energy level.  The waitress was friendly and helpful.  We shared 4 different kinds of their BBQ meats, and they were all delicious.  The brisket was fantastic.  We also shared 4 sides and they were all terrific; the corn was really great.
If you want amazing BBQ and the best service in town, head to Bobby Q! My husband and I had lunch last Sunday, our second time to visit the restaurant. The Onion Brick was delicious, the top sirloin steak enough to split and the Q Rolls over the top yummy! I loved how Jo, the manager on shift, went to every table to make sure the dining experience was the best. Thank you for making our meal over the top great by the top of the line service we received - from everyone! Can't wait till our next visit!
From start to finish everything was superb (Q-rolls, cornbread, meat combo, apple cobbler and that complimentary mini donuts to go!). This is one of the few restaurants that I have dined in where the manager checks on the customers. Thanks for the recommendations and good service, Chelsea!
The husband and I went here last weekend to celebrate the beginning of my break and to get a juicy burger. The restaurant is cute, kind of themed, and the service was friendly. They smoke their meat for 18 hours and you can see their chicken roasting from the dining room. They start you with some pretty good cornbread. For entrees we split the burger with bacon and bbq sauce and the pulled pork sandwich with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese... very healthy. The burger was tasty, not the most amazing burger ever, but solidly good. The pulled pork was better, definitely flavorful and good with their spicy bbq sauce. Both sides were pretty mediocre, I didn't like the mac and cheese...tasted like velveeta and the mashed potatoes were gluey. When we were done they brought out a little bag with a couple doughnut bites in it.... yum! I would come back here to try some more of their Q.
Wow. The lines scared me but the wait was worth it. Fantastic food. Every item outstanding. Service outstanding. Very few places serve ribs line this. The St. Louis ribs peeled of the bone.  The smoke was perfect.
If you've never been to bobby q's you have to try their baby back ribs. They are the best fall off the bone baby back ribs I've ever had!!! The cornbread and donuts are to die for.
This place is the best barbecue I've had in Phoenix so far. For some reason I expected a cafe-style joint given that most places in Arizona are run that way but instead we were greeted with a big, fully decorated roadhouse style building with a huge patio and fancy interior. They even had a separate bar area which I plan to try out soon. I was told it was overpriced and overrated by my in-laws and it was everything but that! We both got a sampler platter which comes with three meat choices, a side, cornbread, and little unexpected fried sugar dough thingers to send you off. I'm usually expecting dried meat and sides that taste like they've been sitting out but everything was perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy. I was even impressed by the corn that had a sweet smokey flavor to it. Only $26 before tax for two people as well. Service was great, energetic, and helpful as well. We took home what little scraps we had and had a midnight snack that reheated well too. I can't wait to come back with friends and family to show them a "cooler" version of claim jumpers.
Funky looking place- huge!  Liked it right away, even from the parking lot.  Friday night when we arrived, crowded and a long wait- about 40 minutes.  We ordered appetizers- the rolled ones with BRISKET in them!  Perfect with a cold Blue Moon beer.  Finally, got a table and a cool waiter who brought us warm cornbread- great start!  We ordered baby back ribs, catfish, fried chicken with baked potato, coleslaw (with pecans!) and, my favorite, the creamy mac & cheese.  Fantastic find.  Only wish we'd had room for the cobbler of the day!
They don't need my help.  Outstanding barbecue, outstanding service, and more food than I could possibly hope to finish.  If you order the Whole Hog, I recommend splitting it between three adults unless at least two of the people in your party are NFL linemen.  Cornbread, wedge salad, beef and baby back ribs, pork, and brisket, top sirloin steak.  All outstanding.  A must-visit for anyone who enjoys barbecue done right.
Outstanding food. Make sure to wear stretchy pants because you will walk out of this restaurant 10 pounds heavier. One of the best BBQ places I've ever tried. I highly suggest making a reservation because it can get busy in there. I've gone with friends and we share the "Whole Hog Heaven" which gives you the opportunity to try 4 different meats on their menu plus 3 sides. But the best part is defitnitely their bbq sauce so make sure to ask for extra because they will gladly give it to you! Their roasted corn is my favorite side dish and the mac and cheese is really good too. . . Also, try the Q-rolls as a starter. The chipotle dip is delicious! And make sure to get an order of the cornbread too..you won't regret it!
Finding good barbecue is a challenge.  With barbecue, people's favorite styles are so different and standards are exacting.  Yelp put me onto Bobby Q.  Impressive ratings.  Rare does any restaurant have the ratings that Bobby Q does.. . It was a Friday night during spring training.  We tried making a reservation that day, but they were already fully booked.  The parking lot was overflowing (at night you can use the lot next door at the small "college") when I arrived.  Loved the smell of smoke as I walked in.  The hostess said 50 minutes.  I don't think it was much more than 30.. . Three of us started with Bobby's Amber Ale.  For those looking for heavy hops (IPA lovers) or deep flavor (stout or porter people), it would be lacking, but I liked it.  We also got the appetizer of little taquitos, Q Rolls, filled with barbecue beef.  Those came with two good sauces.  Very good.. . For the meal, I choose two meats: pulled pork and brisket.  Both were tender, well seasoned, smoky, a little sauced (and I wasn't compelled to add a lot more), and moist.  Others in the group got: a pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and a salad with chicken.  Everyone thought the barbecue was excellent, echoing my comments of seasoning, smoke, and moistness.  Everyone loved the sauce.. . Side: I got the Mac N Cheese and corn.  The corn was excellent with some taste of grilling and well seasoned.  The mac N cheese was good.  Mac N cheese almost always disappoints, and this was better than most, though I didn't love it.  Many in the group went for the grilled vegetables which were excellent.. . An excellent meal.  I can imagine a few being disappointed with the crowds, the wait, or the style of barbecue if it's not their favorite.  I've been to a lot of barbecue places that were not nearly as good.  I haven't gone to any significantly better (except my backyard on 4th of July).  So I'm going to say 5 stars, and I look forward to returning to try the spareribs.. . Why 5 stars?  Why not 4?  This is a barbecue place.  I'm not going to rate it on the same scale a high end fine dining restaurant.  For what it is, a steak and barbecue joint, it does it as well as any place I've been to.  I wish it wasn't as crowded, but it's popular.  If you crave smoke, you should find great satisfaction here.  The sides and appetizer were 4+.  But the star of the show, the smoked meat, was excellent.  That's what I came for, and that's what they get the 5 stars for.
It's been a long time since we have had some good bbq. We gave this place a try due to the outstanding Yelp reviews. Let me just say...thank you Yelpers! The restaurant itself is large and has a good amount of parking. The inside is very nice with dark lighting for a nice setting. We were there today about 2 o clock so it wasnt too busy but I can vet this place gets packed! They do have a bar and they had a nice fire oven that you could see chickens being roasted through the glass. . . We tried the Q rolls for an appetizer and they were very good with the chipotle ranch dipping sauce. For an entree my wife tried the pulled pork sandwich and I had the sampler with chicken, brisket and ribs. Both dishes came with a side. We tried the mashed potatoes and gravy and the mac n cheese. Both sides were creamy and delicious! The meats in the main dish were very flavorful and the bbq sauce is good. We really enjoyed the corn bread and the donuts they give you for dessert. . . Sawyer was a great server!
Try saying Bobby Q three times really fast in a southern accent. It sounds like you're saying Barbeque.. . I can't believe that I've been living in this area for a few years and I just started patronizing Bobby Q's. There's definitely a happening vibe to this place after dark. The place is packed and the air is buzzing with conversations and laughter. They have ample seating inside and outside. We met some friends that have never been here a few weeks ago and they became instantly hooked.. . We ordered steaks, pulled pork, ribs and brisket. Everything along with the sides were fabulous. My brisket was tender and the flavor instantly transported my taste buds to a happy place. The pulled pork was equally as good. I've had the ribs on other trips to Bobby Q and have always enjoyed them. I got a big thumbs up on the steak from my dining companion so I'm going to have to try that next time I'm in the house. The tab for four people without alcohol and before tip was $70. . . This is definitely my favorite BBQ place in the metro area.
My experience here was amazing. My dad and I were both in a really bad mood and looking for a little respite from a horrible day at the hospital. I had driven by Bobby Q's a couple of times and the placed looked fun so we thought we'd give it a try. When we arrived on a Tuesday evening the place was PACKED. The hostess said the wai would be 40 minutes and suggested we have a drink at the bar, which we were happy to do. Our server at the bar Chelsea then set us up at a table by the bar and actually offered to just serve us there. She was incredibly friendly and her enthusiasm felt completely authentic. And after we got our meal I can see why. The food was AMAZING. We had the "Whole Hog" barbecue package which was four different types of meat and three sides and everything was great. I can not wait to return.
I went to a beautiful wedding at Desert Foothills, which was catered by Bobby Q's. Absolutely incredible BBQ. I had the beef brisket, pulled chicken, ribs, smoked sausage and mac and cheese. The ribs and the sliced smoked sausage were AMAZING. So so good. I was in a nice pretty dress, fully planning on eating delicately....one bite, and I was out of control.
Fantastic service. They do a very good lunch. It's about average price range. Having experienced BBQ all over the country it compares probably closest Texas style.
I love BBQ and this place doesn't dissapoint (except for the mac n cheese, tasted like box mac n cheese). Brisket was super tender, ribs fell off the bone, chicken was solid (we got the hog heaven). Try the Q rolls....and try to grab some extra donuts at the end (they're free, like mints).
now i know what all the hype is about around town! this place serves amazing and good quality food! I am a huge fan of their ribs, burgers, and their alcoholic beverages. I ordered this pineapple drink that actually comes in a pineapple , so cool!!
Holy Cow! How many times have you been for BBQ where the quality of the sides has been totally forgotten, not here! Seriously, best mashed potatoes I've ever had. Split the whole hog, 2 1/2 slabs of ribs, 2 piles of meat, 3 sides. Amazing, a bit past tender (fine by me) but perfect rub and sauces. Mac n cheese was crazy good. Staff and service was very friendly, restaurant was done very well, enough southern comfort without the hee haw cheese, no wonder it was still packed at 8:30 with people still waiting to be seated
Amazing!
Best BBQ I have ever had.  Great food, great service, and they even hand you a bag of freshly made donuts for a to-go treat.  This is what eating out should be.
A good friend of mine -who's opinion on Q I highly respect- was in town a few months ago and stopped into Bobby Q's (BQ), and he couldn't stop raving about it. I've been jonesing all week to come check it out, but I figured I'd wait until my wife got into town. Well, I finally got my chance and I was giddy as a school girl. I was actually able to make a reservation through OpenTable on the Yelp app, and I'm sure glad we did. Upon our arrival at 5:30 the place was already packed, but by thetime we left at 7 there was a hoard of people flooding out into the street--and for good reason! Enough jibber-jabber--on to the food! I ordered the Three Meat Combo and that comes with two sides and some of BQ's Cornbread.. . Sides:. . Mac and Cheese- This might easily be the creamiest, most decadent Mac & Cheese I've ever had. They use something similar to Velveeta Cheese to coat it, and I'm not slamming Velveeta. It's so rich I couldn't finish it. 3.75*. . Pecan Coleslaw- I'm very picky about my slaw; I don't want it too creamy, sweet, or bitter and this was absolutely perfect! I also loved the crunch you get from the little pieces of toasted Pecan they add to the top--I'm definitely adding that to my slaw the next time I make it. 5*. . Cornbread- Excellent mix of a Northern/Southern cornbread--it has the cakiness and slight sweetness if Northern, and the crust and stone-ground corn like a Southern; I could eat these everyday. 5* . . Meat:. . St. Louis Ribs- These might be the best St. Louis Pork Ribs (other than mine) that I've ever had! The meat had a nice "tug" to it, but was still so tender, smokey and delicious! 5*. . Beef Brisket- Juicy and flavorful this brisket was quite good--my only gripe is I wish it had a bit more smokiness to it. 4*. . Pulled Pork- Another excellent job by BQ! Juicy, smoky and porky (just like me!) Everything you could want in Pulled Pork and then some. I piggled (sic) the whole lot of it! 5*. . Dessert:. . Sugar-Cinnamon Donuts- They give everyone at the table these tiny little donuts that they make fresh up front and they're fabulous; they had me at "Cinnamon". I guess you can just walk in and order a dozen for $3 if that's all your craving, too. 5*. . Service & Ambiance- Good service from our server, Jessica. She was on top of things without being annoying. BQ is located in a building that looks like something you'd find in the middle of nowhere. The interior is mostly brick and wood causing the noise level in there to be deafening by the end of the night. They also keep it a bit too dark for my liking, but the decor is swell. 4*-service/3.5*-Ambiance. . Value- The meals here are not a bad value, as my Three Meat Combo cost $22, but it's more than enough food for 2 people. Even my piggy self couldn't finish it--but guess what's for breakfast?! Snooch to the Nooch! 4*. . I'm about to make a bold proclamation: I think BQ has *the* best BBQ I've ever had. I don't make that statement lightly either--after all, I have a reputation to uphold. I think this was easily the best meal I've had here in AZ, and that's saying something. I can't wait for my next visit to the Valley of the Sun so I can visit DQ again. If you ever find yourself in Phoenix, I highly, highly recommend making your way here--just make sure to make a reservation!
The interior is awesome the service is a wonderful it's very high-class very clean very welcoming in general it's really good barbecue I just have had far better barbecue for a lot cheaper. I would definitely suggest it to someone but not before I suggest about three or four different barbecue places first.
