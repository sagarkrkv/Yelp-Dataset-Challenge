My wife and I went here back in January and had a great time.  We went kind of early so is wasn't packed or extremely loud like some reviewers have posted.  The atmosphere overall was nice,  we were seated at a table by ourselves since it wasn't very crowded at the time.. . My wife ordered Hofbrauhaus Wurstplatte (Sausage Platter) and I got the Schnitzel Wiener Art (breaded Veal cutlet) and we shared for some variety.  Both plates were delicious,  we would have devoured it all but the servings were big so there was some food left over. . . The beer was good and cold, we both ordered the large mug (I think it was a liter).  I participated in a beer chugging contest for a free mug and came in 2nd out of 10.  No free mug but it was free to participate. . . There was not a band playing while we were there but there was a solo guy providing some entertainment,  he also coordinated the chugging contest.. . If you order any shots, prepare to get swatted with a paddle.  Not sure if they do that in Germany or not but it was funny for everyone else to see and drew their attention when it cracked.. . The only down side to this place was the location.  It was off the main strip so far, probably took us 20-30 minutes to walk each direction.  Not a big deal as we needed the exercise anyway after trying to eat all that food, would consider taking a taxi next time.  . . Overall we had a great time here and will go back next time we go to Vegas.  Will probably go a little later to experience the full band and lively crowds.
Why come here?. . 1. Giant beer hall mimicking original Munich beer hall!. 2. Great German food!!. 3. Awesome entertainment in the form of German band, host with the most, paddling on the butt, beer drinking contest, etc!!!. . I have been here several times, and have never been disappointed. If you are looking for a fun, casual and random night out, do try this little gem! It is especially fun on Saturdays, as they pull out all the stops with their live entertainment, that often includes getting patrons off their butts and on tables and chairs singing together while waving their steins. The food is enjoyable and hearty and the beers are great! I'm obviously not German so I can't say how authentic the food is, but i still think it's yummy. This place is obviously full of cliches and is most likely not what the real Munich is like, but all that matters to me is that I always leave smiling from ear to ear. . . I actually booked a few tables here for about  thirty five guests the night before my wedding. The staff took great care of us. My friends loved all the excitement and the preselected catered orders were a feast. Totally worth the money! Many of my friends have gone on to take their friends and spread the word on this place. Btw, do buy a shot, but if you do, be aware that the skinniest waitresses usually paddle the hardiest!
Enter scene: huge tourtisty beer hall with tons of frat boy types, practically puking on your shoes and cheesy German music, super loud it's hard to enjoy.  Did I mention that when we were leaving, we saw one loser urinating on the front steps, not even trying to hide his small penis?  Gross, gross and gross.. . I'm giving them 2 stars since they did have vegetarian options (and tasty curry on fries), but their soft pretzels were not good (huge bummer, I live for pretzels), a bit dry and kind of "meh." . . Only 3 German beer choices -- if I remember correctly it was light, medium, dark.  Meh.
I love going here to down beers it is such a fun drinking environment. However the food is awful! Everytime I go order the kids noodles, which is not even good but the only thing I can eat there. . I love beer broiled brats with coleslaw. I wish they would have something like this, or a brat pizza for kids. The food is seriously so discussting I mean it is the only restaurant I have ever been that I cannot find one thing good on the menu.. But I will always go back for the atmosphere and large beer steins. I recommend and take all my friends here.
As others have said, this place is loud and obnoxious.  Not a criticism....just a factual statement.. . Most people drink one of three beers by the pitcher and join in on group songs and chants.  It's pretty fun if you're not too uptight.  One of the strangest traditions is a paddling (wooden paddle from waitress) that guys line up for.  . . The food was an unremarkable plate of sausages.  It was on par w food court food.. . If you want a frat part experience, this is your place.
OMG!!! The BEER, BAND and crowd are amazing. When we go to Vegas we HAVE to go there. Real German beer and bands both imported from Munich. I usually just eat a snack, The Obazter cheese spread w/Big pretzel, but all my kids eat the food and it is good!! A bit pricey but so worth it to us. I think everyone should go here once. Now me and my kids want to go to Munich.
The Hofbrauhaus can provide a "guten nacht" for everyone if you want to go to a great German themed restaurant. However, expect to pay for it!. . Having been to the actual Munchen Hofbrauhaus and I can tell you the decor is quite similar. Big long oak tables, a boisterous band of German singers, and more beer than you should be drinking. . . The food while not absolutely authentic "best German food ever", I do think that it provides enough of an idea of what German food looks and tastes like for the curious patron. . . This particular night that I went, the "haus" had a really fun young band of German singers who really knew how to get the crowd into the night. There was drinking songs, blowing the alpine horn game, and drunken dancing. What else do you want from a German restaurant?. . The one problem with Hofbrauhaus is the fact that its more like a "tourist spot". You just go there not for the food, but for the experience and the "I just went to Germany feeling". While I recommend everyone to go once. Going on a regular basis probably means you don't care about money, or you're an alcoholic.. . Try it once, order the Leiberkase (don't ask me what it is) and enjoy!
This probably isn't the sort of place you would go to every week, but once in a blue moon it is a great time.  I see lots of uptight reviews for Hofbrauhaus and I'm surprised.  If you want to go to the loud, rowdy, bar full of character- this is it.  The food is marginal and I'm not that hot on German beer, but I'll give this place 5 stars all day long because it is just knuckle dragging fun.  Throw on your finest lederhosen and leave grandma at home.
I was really looking forward to trying this place and when I finally did, I was disappointed. First things first, the food was average and expensive for what they offer. Granted this is a tourist spot, so the pricing is to be expected. I wouldn't recommend taking your kids here. This is basically the "German experience" of drinking and having fun with a little food thrown in. The beer hall smells terrible, like stale beer and sweat. Gross.. . Now, on to the more important item. The service was so-so and my waiter tried to cheat me when we paid the bill. If you read nothing else in this review, read this - NEVER leave a cash tip if paying by card at this place! I charged our dinner, but left a cash tip and the waiter chased us down in the parking lot saying that he accidentally charged our card twice. This was a complete lie because while he went back inside with my card, I checked my bank app and it showed the exact amount I signed for on the receipt. He came back out a few minutes later and we went on our way. The next day I checked the bank and noticed the charge from the HB was for a higher amount and NOT the amount I signed for on the receipt. I called the HB and spoke to a very nice young lady in the accounting department who handled this whole mess after the fact. I sent her a copy of my signature and what do you know, it did not match the receipt. Hence, this waiter assumed I was a tourist visiting Las Vegas and not a resident, and he figured he could just steal from me and I wouldn't do anything about it. He took my generous cash tip and then tried to steal more money from me by charging my card for an second tip. It took nearly TWO WEEKS of my calling the HB to get the amount that I was owed refunded to me. This waiter committed fraud and, at the very least, should have been FIRED. That didn't happen. They told me that they've never had problems with him. Yeah, well, just because actual tourists don't complain when they sober up doesn't mean it isn't happening. He tried to steal from me and he'll try to steal from you too.. . My overall suggestion is to avoid this place, but if you feel you just have to have the experience, pay with cash only.
Seemed like fun and a great idea. We love good German food and let's just say that we could not say that we got any. Very overpriced, we ordered one combo platter one cheese spaetzl dish, 2 deserts to go ($10 each) and 1 cocktail and soda. Total was almost $90. Another negative, This place is listed as good for kids and I must say that even with my 7 & 9 yr old who love to be around music and noise, but this place is unbearably loud. Can't even talk to one another or hear the waitresses, and I'm not exaggerating either. My kids looked like they were drowning in the noise, both were slumped in their seats almost falling asleep because of the disturbing noise of drunkenness surrounding this large room of hoorah and screaming. You literally feel trapped. Women were being spanked with paddles by the employees, while men cheered on. I wish I could say I enjoyed some kind of aspect here since I insisted on going here and really looked forward to the experience, but instead I felt like a horrible mother and completely ripped off. Never again. . . Maybe perfect for a fraternity get together, but not for us.
I have lived in Vegas for a long time and had always heard good things about this place. My wife and I went for the first and last time 2 days ago. One of our friends was celebrating his birthday and chose to go here. I was genuinely excited about it. We showed up and the place looked cool. The music was alright and the atmosphere seemed nice. I am a bit of a beer snob so u was very excited to try a variety of German beer.  They offer 3 choices..... 3 lame ass choices. It's either a light, dark or a hefenweizen(sp). I love dark beer so I ordered that one. At 15 bucks a beer the size of it was beautiful. Large manly glass. The taste on the other hand sucked! I would have paid  maybe 7 bucks tops for it. It wasn't complete crap but I expected better. I ordered a plate consisting of two white sausages and a Bavarian pretzel. Knowing a little about German culture I was expecting manly sized portions. Boy was I wrong. I received two tiny sausages. The average bratwurst one buys at a local grocery store dwarfs these lame tiny links. The taste was okay but nothing special at all. At least I had my fresh Bavarian pretzel to look forward too. Wrong again! It was a decent size but it tasted like it had been sitting in a freezer all week long and had just been popped into a microwave for a minute before being served. I was expecting a large warm fresh soft pretzel. I received a room temperature, stale pretzel that tasted like crap.pretzel time or auntie m's would destroy this place in a pretzel competition. Over all, I am never going back to this sad excuse for a restaurant. If I want good food and beer I'm going to the Chicago brewing company. I feel that real German people would be ashamed of this place.
This place was quite a disappointment. I'm a Vegas local and after many years of driving past this place, finally decided to eat here. Made a reservation for 10pm and got there a bit late. We were told that the bar and kitchen was closing the moment we got there so we had to order quickly. Everything was rushed and the place was pretty much empty. Guess the staff really hates staying late. Food was okay, but nothing spectacular. Our pretzel was hard as a rock. Almost inedible. I got this sausage sampler and most of the sausages were cold and tough and one had a bone fragment in it. The busser came and cleaned off our table before we had completely finished eating..extremely rude. We were told they were closing in 10 minutes and they made our dessert to-go. Overall, not the best experience regardless of whether or not it was before close. You don't want people coming in late, don't allow them to make reservations and then rush them through eating. I now consider this place a tourist trap and would not recommend it to locals. Food was overpriced and lackluster.
Friends and I make trips here regularly when we hit up vegas. One of the best German beer hall experiences around! Polka band, especially the leader, was awesome! A buddy won the stein holding contest!
I was born and raised in Germany, so I really wanted to check this place out since I have not been back home in a few years! While the cucumber salad and bretzel were good, the rest was not! I had the jagerschnitzel, nothing like back home! My husbands food also lacked flavor! Simply overpriced and not that good!
This place is a mix of a bingo hall and a medieval dinner hall. It's 2pm and people are already piss drunk requiring assistance to leave. This place is so much fun.
Loud, boisterous, and full of drunken fun!  That's the Hofbrauhaus for ya (sorry guys, I'm not sure how to make the a with the umlauts, but that's what I intended fyi).  Hofbrauhaus is the quintessential rowdy restaurant where you can get some tasty beers and good eats.  I always find myself here in a party-type situation; mostly of the birthday type.  Honestly, the atmosphere fits and doesn't disappoint!. . They have a live band playing both American and German folks songs while you get your drink or grub on and it keeps the lively atmosphere going.  As for the beer, they have 1/4, 1/2, and full liter mugs available depending on your thirst level.  IMO the best time to come in and funnel some beer into your gullet is around Oktoberfest.  Their Oktoberfest beer is awesome and highly recommended.  But, in the "off-season", the dunkel and hefe do just fine.. . I've only had a few dishes here but I usually gravitate toward the veggie options.  They have a few veggie items available including the veggie brautwurst that comes complete with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  I've also tried the chicken braut here and they're similar enough to go either or, really.  The side salad is a healthy sized plate as well so if you're looking for something a little smaller to snack on, the side is a good option.  Also, before I forget, the soft pretzel here is really nice.  It's especially nice when it's fresh out and pieced off with a dab of the cheese or mustard sauce 'shmeared' on.. yummyyy.  Pro tip: alternate sauces when going in on the pretzel... trust me, it's a good time.. . Good times, good beers, and pretty good food here at the Hof!  I don't come here often but definitely lookin' toward Oktoberfest for more seasonal German beer goodness.
