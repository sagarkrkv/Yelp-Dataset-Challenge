This place kills it! Staff was on point. Polite, quick, and efficient! Spicy miso was amazing and pork steam buns are always a favorite. Bachi never disappoints!
Went here around 4:00 on Sunday afternoon! Was able to get seated right away. thanks to two empty seats at the bar...but then the tradeoff came!. . The entrees took a LONG time to come out!!! We didn't get our burgers till 5:00! All the while a couple sitting at a table next to the bar got their food and left before the burgers even came to the bar (Keep in mind said couple was seated 10-15 min AFTER us)! The server was profusely apologetic about the long wait but I chose to stay classy in the end despite the temptation to complain. For as long as they made us wait and how often they asked us if there was anything we can get, I would have appreciated a comp on desserts or drinks! People shouldn't have to shout/req to speak to manager/make a scene just to get noticed! After finishing the Portuguese donuts, I just wanted to get out of there! So much so I payed cash and told her to keep the $1 or $2 change! I would have liked to tip more because I truly enjoyed the free bird burger and our server's attentiveness, but that was a horrendous wait for the entrees! Yes I realize you had 3 or 4 groups over 5, but that doesn't excuse the fact that others received who came to sit after us (including a couple newly seated next to me at the bar towards the end of our burger noshing) received their entrees faster than we did!. . I'm open to going back when there's absolutely nobody or if I place a takeout order in advance! Maybe then the wait will be less long.
Finally stopped by Bachi Burger to experience everything people have raved to me about. Everything started out great - assorted pickles, oxtail chili cheese fries with a fried egg on top, truffle Parmesan sweet potato fries with pineapple ketchup. Our server seemed to be having a rough day as she messed up our order several times and forgot to bring a coffee we ordered after asking about it on 4 separate occasions. I decided to go with the Shogun Burger ($26) which is Bachi's premium burger: wagyu beef prepared medium, foie gras, unagi, Asian pear and arugala. Something didn't taste right from the beginning but our server never even came by to ask how everything was and seemed way too busy to even want to bother her despite the fact we were sitting at the bar right in front of her. About halfway through the burger I deconstructed it to find out what was wrong and I realized the beef was the issue: over cooked, dry and completely flavorless. I spoke to the manager who came to the table in a very unpleasant manner and said she would take care of it. Upon returning she informed us that she had kindly removed 10% from the entire bill which sounded great but turned out to be $7 - $7 off of a $26 dry and flavorless burger. I told her it would not suffice and she informed me that since I had eaten half of the burger, that 10% is all she could do. She offered to make a new burger for FULL PRICE and I told her that is completely inappropriate. After she went back and showed my burger to the chef who was arguing with her in plain sight which allowed me to see and hear everything he was saying, he told her to comp the burger in disgust. She brought the bill back, threw it down in front of us and walked away without saying a word. I'm not saying this is a typical day at Bachi Burger but it was absolutely disgusting behavior. The burger was just bad. The meat was flavorless and the patty was about as thick as a Burger King Whopper patty - definitely not $26 restaurant quality, especially since the other burger that was ordered was a thick and juicy correctly prepared and very flavorful patty. To top it all off, the bathroom was a complete mess with what looked like food or possibly some human excrement ground into the floor: I nearly vomited at the sight. Despite all of this, I would not expect to have the same experience again and would give the place another shot and I would recommend it to others because there are so many options on the menu.. . In the end, they handled the bill correctly and comped the burger but they are completely ill prepared for handling these situations. Our server seemed so overwhelmed and busy that she was completely inattentive but was very kind and compassionate and apologized repeatedly for the quality of the food. A patron shouldn't have to argue their case for a $26 Burger - you're a restaurant, own up to your mistake and take care of it. A happy restaurant brings happy patrons who spend more and write great reviews.
Had seen Bachi Burger on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and HAD to go there.  It didn't disappoint!  I had Kiki's burger which had a sweet sauce, arugula garlic aioli, caramelized bacon and some other undefined, but incredible flavors.  My wife had the Mr. Miyagi which was smothered with onion rings and was excellent as well.  If you think you can't do anything new with onion rings, think again. They were incredible!  The place was packed but never lacked in service. They REALLY need to open one of these in Seattle.  Best burger I've ever eaten!
Trendy and loud on a Thursday night. My wife and I ordered two burgers and swapped 1/2's so we could sample two burgers each!  I had the Kimchee burger. I'll hit this place up again when I'm back in Vegas.
It's a casual burger joint with two tvs showing food network and cooking channels.  The hostess and the waitresses were very friendly.  We ordered the Ronin Burger with Wagyu and we both loved the taste!  My wife hates the beef taste, but she thought it was mild plus the pickled veggies counteracted the beef taste very well.  So that's a HUGE thumbs up for the meat.... We ordered the truffle fries and if you love them crunchy, then these are the ones for you.  We finished the huge cone very quickly as a result.. The last thing we ate was the pork belly bun.  It was SOOO tender and moist, and the bun is very light and fluffy, very similar to the buns used for Peking duck.  We actually had to fight for the third piece, but finally resolved to "split" it... meaning she had 3/4 of it while I got a small dot of meat and a little bun... hehe. I figured by then, everything should be delicious here, so I ordered the Portuguese donuts for a dessert.... ehh.  I didn't care for it,. The outside was good and crunchy with the cinnamon and sugar coating.  But unfortunately, the taste didn't permeate into the inside.  So it was just doughy... and not even fluffy doughy but very dense.  I wouldn't order it again.. But overall, I would definitely recommend this awesome burger joint and will definitely go back!
Took the family here and we really enjoyed it. The service was fantastic and the food is very retro.
Triple D definitely found a winner here.  Bookmarked this place after seeing it on TV and am so glad that I did.  I would never have thought to order their infamous Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, however they were so delicious.  The plate was literally scraped clean.  . . Also their No Meat Here ... "Burger" was one of the very best vegetarian burgers I have ever had.  And I've eaten A LOT of veggie burgers.  Everything from the eggplant to the tofu to the mushroom patty was on point.  A really great combination of flavors.  I would definitely come back here, just to order this particular burger again.  In fact I can't wait to take my vegetarian sister here.  That's how good it is.
Love this place. I don't care how busy and how long I wait. The food is so good worth the wait.
I have been wanting to go here for a while. .. If you like sweet and refreshing try the Apple lichee Soda.  The oxtail chilli cheese frys are the way to go.  Also the Truffle.  Parm fries rock,  also don't be cheap order all your burgers in "wagu" aka america kobe. My suggestions are the kiki, black and green and the sho gun.
A few weeks ago, I went here with a couple of friends and my boyfriend for his birthday. It was my first time ever eating here and with all the praise that I've heard from this place, I had high expectations. . . It was Saturday lunch time and it was expected to be busy. It was a 40 minute wait but it wasn't too bad--I just wish that they would have additional seating other than the 8 they had inside the restaurant. However, this doesn't affect my review; more seats would have been nice.. . We were seated in and everything was so loud and fast-paced. Our server wasn't very good at listening to our orders however, but it was probably due to the loud noises (even though we practically yelled our orders). The server was also a bit irritating because when one of us wanted to get the burger cooked well-done, she asked if we wanted all the orders to come together since preparing a burger well-done would take a while and we said it was fine but she insisted on bringing the orders out as soon as they're done. We had to reassure her like 3 times that we wanted them out at the same time. . . I ordered the Ronin and it was verydelicious, however I tried the Miyagi my boyfriend ordered and it was even better, but to me it wasn't THAT great like everyone said it to be. Same with their truffle fries--quite delicious, but nothing too special.. . Despite its deliciousness, I didn't think of it as being amazing as others think it is. I would come whenever I get the chance again, but it's nothing crave-worthy for me to come back ASAP.
my first visit to bachi was far from pleasant. I arrived just after opening on a Saturday. there were about five guest in the lobby, some eating and some awaiting service. behind the bar/line I counted six employees, one of which was the bar tender who was on the phone taking a call-in order. he made eye contact with me three times and still said nothing. shortly after, (and at the point that I was ready to leave) I was seated. I ordered the shotgun burger and a coke, which came quickly. . . during my meal I saw several employees chatting and playing on their phones in view of customers. the food is good but the customer service is lacking.
I love this place! My girlfriend and I come here every time we visit Vegas! One of the best burgers i've had, nothing compares tho bachi. Great customer service, the waiters are always super nice and always suggest great items on the menu!
While in town for NYE, a local friend brought me here for my first visit.  I'm awaiting their opening here in my hometown back in Southern California.  Yes the Oxtail Chili Cheese fries are awesome.  We also shared the Miyagi-San Burger and another that I cannot recall. One had a sweet purple taro bun and chinese sausage .  Busy place but they were quick to get us seated and served.  Everything was delicious and even with our appetites going big that night I still had some leftovers that hit the spot after a late night.  Best wishes to this company, I'm sure you have much more in store.
Am I lame for saying this was my most looked forward to place during my weekend Vegas getaway? At least it didn't disappoint! Unfortunately, this was a forced meal - as in, we came here on our way out of Vegas hungover af and not even hungry. But we ordered a lot of food anyway... For the two of us, we got the oxtail chili cheese fries, pork belly steamed buns, and the shogun burger. . . Oxtail chili cheese fries $11.50: This was really good! The chili was heavy in taste (good for the chili but can't say I know what oxtail tastes like) but I wish there was more cheese. Definitely a plate to be shared.. . Pork belly steamed buns $10: Very Asian tasting (good thing obviously)! The glaze on the pork belly is sweet (how it's supposed to be). Comes with three, definitely share this too!. . Shogun burger $26: The grand finale... The major components were wagyu beef, unagi (eel), and foie gras. There were no doubt LOTS of flavors but my bf thought it was too much. He wasn't a big fan of the unagi (but I was!). My issue with the burger was that it was way too oily. The combination of two days worth of alcohol and the greasiness of the burger (with the fries and pork belly too) was just too much for me to handle. I definitely had a stomach ache for the rest of the day - not that I'm blaming Bachi Burger. Was it worth $26? Mm I don't think so. I really like foie gras (bf is French) so putting it inside the burger was a bit of a waste to me. Though it did taste really good when I bit into it separately.. . Anyway, great place to try! I'd definitely come again when I'm around.
Went here on a lazy Monday afternoon. The place wasn't very busy (only three other tables seated). Had to wait a few minutes before being greeted at the door, but it wasn't long enough to complain about. . . Our server was very friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable about the menu. . . Kiki burger, spicy miso burger, and Parmesan truffle fries were all pretty decent (even though the spicy miso burger literally had no hint of heat).. . The only disappointment is that our server forgot to put in the chocolate peanut butter souffle. The dessert takes 20-25 minutes to prepare and we ordered it at the same time as our food. He said he would put it in five minutes after our food comes out so that it would still be hot by the time we were done with the burgers...but obviously forgot to do so. . . I guess it was an honest mistake, but we were really looking forward to that souffle and waiting another half hour for it after our meal was not an option. Again, it wasn't even busy at all so I don't know how he forgot. . . Another girl had taken over our table for him and ended up giving us a peanut butter chocolate milkshake to make up for the souffle. She was even considerate enough to put some berries in it so it was like the souffle. . . As a side note - I can understand some of the other negative/impartial reviews about service. Not all of the servers were attentive/friendly. We did have to keep waiting for refills on our waters.
Went to Bachi Burger the other night in a group of 4. I have frequented this restaurant before and would give it 3 to 4 stars on those visit. This visit was different for the following reasons:. . 1. We were put on a waiting list with our phone number so the hostess could call us. We returned to check on our spot and the hostess said she had just called our party. The hostess before did not communicate that they were using phone numbers. (must have been a shift change). Not a big deal by itself. We had good timing and did not lose our spot.. . 2. Server did not introduce himself and was very cold and lacked any personality or genuine concern. While the service was not terrible it was definitely lacking. . . 3. We were going to split 4 burgers. we requested that our burgers be cut in quarters so we could do this easily. The server told us her could bring us steak knives but they wont serve it cut. I asked another server and she said the same thing.. . 4. We decided to do one less burger since we were not able to have the burgers cut to share. We decided it would be too much of a project to try to do at our table with steak knives. Two of the people in our party were going to split a burger and the other two would have there own.. . 5. We asked if it was possible to get the burger that was being shared cut in half. It was a plain Jane burger and I was sure the kitchen could handle this. This resulted in a female staff member who I assume was a manager visiting my table to explain that they did not want to cut the burger because it would change the presentation(the cook wants the presentation his way) and the kitchen is really busy, "so in order to expedite the cooking process they would prefer not to cut the burger". This was a bit of an insult to anyone who has worked in the culinary world not to mention a paying guest.. . 6. The manager took a uncompromising position as I did let her know this. The server hawked over our table the remainder of the visit, most likely to try to regain any lost tip (we still tipped 20%). . . In summary, the food was good, but there are plenty of burger joints in the Las Vegas area, many of which I will visit more frequently in place of Bachi Burger. They are pricey as well in comparison to more established burger joints.. . The customer service aspect and the arrogant manner in which the manager handled a simple request was what drove down this experience the most. My sister reminded me on this visit that she had previously come here and the chef refused to add lettuce to a burger because "it would change the taste profile of the food".. . Advice to the chef: despite your enthusiasm for what YOU want, what YOU want comes second to what the GUEST wants. The guest is paying for a product as well as an experience. Without us, the GUESTS, YOU are out of a job.. . Advice to the manager/supervisor: If you want to help the business grow as well as add to your professional success you will have a much easier road granting a special request rather than insulting your patrons intelligence by discussing logistics of a burger kitchen. In the time it took to give your enthusiastic lecture on expediting product from the kitchen, you might have been able to cut 20 or 30 burgers or maybe even grant a simple request to go above and beyond your current set of service standards. Instead we ordered one less burger on this visit, skipped desert and probably wont be back. YOUR JOB IS TO ENSURE GUEST SATISFACTION WHILE CREATING GUEST/BRAND LOYALTY. THE GUEST IS ALWAYS RIGHT. WITHOUT THEM YOU WOULD NOT HAVE A JOB.
It was fortunate I was in Las Vegas for a business trip.  My brother mentioned how great Bachi burger wasand I had to stop by.  He recommended the Alaskan Cod burger and the Ox Tail chili cheese fries.  The best burger I've eaten so far.  My friend had a Wagyu burger (name of the burger escapes me).  Although the Wagyu burger was great tasting as well, the Alaskan Cod burger felt light and had a great taste to it.  . . The buns on the burger were soft.  Although the burger has a tall look, you can press it down to fit into your mouth.  . .  I didn't find anything special with the Ox tail chili cheese fries.  . . I will get one of these burgers every time I stop by Vegas.
Best burgers in VEGAS hands down!!! Miyagi is the best! Ox tail chili fries are BOMBASTIC FANTASTIC with fried egg of course...and they have a great selection of Japanese beers. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!
Bachi burger never fails! My favorite is the Mr. Ho's burger and a taro boba. The Bachi pickles and truffle parmesan fries are a must as well!
Yelpsters and the locals raved about this place so I stopped by for lunch and was not to be disappointed.  Ordered the Truffle parmesan fries which is enough for 2 people and the Spicy Miso Burger.  The picture does not do these items justice as this Asian fusion burger was over the top in my book and the truffle parmesan fries was one of the best that I have had. Service standards were top notch as I noticed the servers and bussers worked as a team and it was apparent that cleanliness in the "front of the house" was spot on!
I absolutely love this place.  It is a bit pricy but it's so worth it!  The oxtail chili cheese fries are AMAZING (and huge for an appetizer).  I've tried several burgers here but the Ronin burger is my favorite.  They also have a pretty decent beer selection for such a small place.  The last time we were there they had set up tables out on the patio so I'm looking forward to that during the summer!  This is a must visit if you're on this side of town.
I have been to Bachi Burger 5 times now and here is my take on it. This is definitely a nice place to go to for a unique tasting burger & appetizers. I mean that in a good way of course, however, the reason I am not giving this place 5 stars has nothing to do with menu items or cuisine, but rather the inconsistency of quality. It is quite obvious that they have one or two really good chefs that are phenomenal cooks, and all the others are pretty much bench players.. . Now, I don't know how many chefs they have but I came to this conclusion through logical reasoning, for I couldn't imagine their star chef having such an off day that they would produce "BBQ in the park with friends" quality food. So, the first 2 visits were great and then one bad, one good, and the last bad. It seems that on the busy days, like on a weekend, are the best times to go which were my first to visits. The other three visits were done through the weekdays, so if you go through the week my experience has been hit or miss (but as the record stands more miss during the week). Although, if you are interested in a boba tea just shy away, especially, if you ever been to any boba place on Spring Mountain (China Town) for you will be very disappointed.
Love this place! I had a miyagi-san, a wagyu burger w/ crispy onion strings, bacon, a fried egg, and an awesome BBQ type glaze. It was on a soft, eggy, sweet roll. Bangin burger! And cheaper than anything comparable you'd find on the strip . . The truffle parm fries were some of the best I've had. They porcini mushroom sauce on them is soooo good. And the roasted red pepper aioli is the perfect complement. . . The fried chicken appetizer was also awesome! Everything we had was so good! I'm definitely hitting this place up again when I'm back in Vegas!
Be sure to bring your appetite because after you see the menu you will want to order several things. My fiance and I ordered two burgers, both of which were huge and delivered a pack of flavor with each bite, we also split the Oxtail fries. The fries were so different and I can only describe it like fireworks in my mouth. We couldn't finish it because it's just so much food along with the burgers but we did not regret ordering all that we did. The fries  started getting a little soggy so I wouldn't want to take it back to my hotel. . . Service was just okay and the night wasn't very busy. We came later in the evening and it was during the week. Refills took a long time, which is needed, when you're trying to eat all this rich food.
I always forget to write a review while I'm there.. Im not a huge burger fan so it has to be pretty amazing to impress me. I actually look forward to eating a burger if were going here!! The parmesan fries, fried egg on a burger.. Its always slammed packed but worth the wait. The service could be a little better but the food is absolutely worth it.
The best burger I've ever had in my liiiiife: Miyagi sans grass fed wagyu burger. Seriously, order it and be happy.. . Great service & beverage options. Their ube boba shake was delicious! I have to come to this place every time I'm in Vegas.
I ate here on my birthday and then I seriously dreamt about it for days on end so I had to come back within a week.  The Miyagi-san burger is amaaaazeeee and so are the oxtail chili cheese fries & truffle parmesan fries.. . Service is great, but they seem really rushed.  I don't mind, because I'd rather spend more time eating my food than talking to the server.
So I recently went to this place to satisfy my cravings as it had been over 6 months ago, or even longer since my last fixin here. I can't remember bc it's been way too long. If you had asked me to rate this place a year ago, it would've been a solid 4.5 stars! Now, it hasfallen down quite a bit as with their new renovations of adding an extended bar, (limiting their space to seat customers) and the huge lack of customer service...I for sure thought that didn't really matter to me as the food is the only reason why I even came. That got shot down quickly as my bahnmi burger was just not the same as before. It was too salty and the patty was way too dry. What happened to the yummy pickled veggies?? Maybe it was just an off night for the chef, but I will say I'm willing to try again. My lychee martini was tasty, but bartender left chunks of ice in it. Let's just hope this was an off night!
The worst service I've ever had! The burger I had left me sick for 3 days the first time I came here. The 2nd time I came I waited for 40 minutes just to get a glass of water and greeted. The worst!
Burgers are excellent... especially for Las Vegas.  There isn't a crazy plethora of burger places here like there are in So. Cal.  . . However, its too busy and super disorganized.  Its a poor use of space and the staff isn't trained well enough.  They should learn to maximize use of the space and at least seat people.  They're not the most accommodating so its hard for me to bring people or go back even though I loved the food.  . . The service isn't great.  They tend to forget things and they can't seem to keep everything moving.  . . I wish I could make this a regular spot because its just as good as umami (which has smaller portion sizes) and stout (with more food options... but much less beer choices) but I won't wait this long just to get a burger. It would be great to have a bar area or find a way to get people in more quickly.
We were just off the plane from a very long flight from the east coast and we were pretty hungry. My guy suggested bachi burger based on reviews on line. I must comment that this restaurant is super.  The waitstaff was more than courteous and accommodating . She explained a lot of the menu and we made our selections based on her selections which were spot on. The burgers were terrific and the salt and pepper fries luscious.  The Arnold Palmer was so so but we weren't there for the drinks anyway. Bachi is well worth your time if you are in Vegas.
Came here from LA to visit friends and we went to Bachi Burger for lunch. I gotta say, their burgers are juicy and so delicious! I highly recommend this place to anyone that's craving for an awesome burger. I had the Miyagi-San burger. If you'd like an egg on your burger then gotta give this one a try. And the oxtail chili cheese fries go great with the burger as well. The service was great too, great staff.  I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Vegas.
The food is consistently fantastic. Love the Miyagi burger and the salted Carmel shake is AMAZING. Only negative is that the service is kind of hit or miss.  However, they have great take out service so problem solved
the fish burger here is good and comes w/ a sweet sauce that's yummy.  i also tried the shishito peppers and the house salad.  my friends also got the oxtail chili cheese fries, fried chicken, sweet potato fries and truffle fries, and they said it was all good.
See my updated review from 8/5/2014. . . I had very high hopes for Bachi Burger after reading reviews and seeing them on DDD. So while I was in town for business last week I had to go. I have to admit, I was a bit underwhelmed. The food wasn't bad, it was actually good. But that's just it.... good. I certainly admire the moxy of the chef when creating his menu, but it's nothing I haven't seem back home. Asian inspired this and pickled that, I get it, I've seen it before and I like it.  But in this Asian, truffled, pickled world, if you're gonna do it, be better than everyone else. Bachi Burger isn't, but that's ok. As stated before, the food here is good. . . I started with the Oxtail Chili Fries. I love the addition of the sunny side up egg. I know, everything nowadays comes with a runny egg on top, but it really works here. The rich yolk plays well with the chili, that is a bit on the sweet side. The thinly sliced chiles add just the right amount of heat. The oxtail is nice and tender, perfectly cooked. The downside of the dish was the sweetness of the chili, but overall very good. . . I had the Pork Belly Steamed Buns based on several yelp reviews. I've made a similar dish at home and wanted to compare. These were nothing special, maybe a bit underseasoned, but again.... good. I really liked the dipping sauce, kind of a miso BBQ sauce. I'll stick to mine. . . The service was excellent and friendly. . . Warning: My friend ordered his burger well done and the server told him it would take 25-30 minutes for his burger. I thought that was weird, but oh well. . . P.S. This is really a 2-1/2 Star review, and I will be back again to explore the menu a bit in hopes that I'll find that one "wow" item I'm looking for.... . Update to my review from a few months ago:. . Revisited Bachi Burger today for lunch. Had the Miyagi-San Burger and the Salt & Pepper French Fries. Both were epic!. . The burger was perfectly cooked (medium rare) with bacon, furikake seasoning and onion rings. . . The fries were possibly the best 'dressed up' fries I've ever had. Topped with onion salt, cilantro, fresh jalapenos, lemon grass (?) with a delicious dipping sauce. . . I'll be back for sure.
HOLY CRAP!!!! THE BEST BURGERS EVER!!!!!!!!. . I went to Bachi Burger last weekend and it was so amazing!! If you live in Vegas, or you're there for vacation and you're sober enough to drive off the strip for a little bit, then you have to come here!  It is a pretty small restaurant so I would suggest that you get there early or you will end up waiting for over an hour.. . The food is the perfect mix of Asian and comforting deliciousness.  I would definitely recommend the chili cheese fries. They come with a fried egg on top of it!!! I mean come on! How could you not want that?? I also got the miyagi san burger.  I would recommend it if you like onion rings and fried eggs in your burger. . . I can say that there is absolutely nothing bad about this burger place and if you think there is then you're obviously a bad person.
More than a review this a request or better yet a plead, dear Bachi owner please open a Bachi restaurant in Portland, it has been more than 6 months since I moved from Las Vegas and I can not find a decent burger that vaguely resembles the taste of the Ronin, the Kiki, or the Miyagi San, I truly believe that Bachi had ruined any burger I may try, because all the time me an my family are comparing it to your Burgers!. . Hoping to see Bachi around in Portland! otherwise I may need to seriously consider becoming a VEGETARIAN...
This was amazingggggggggggg!!! I can't even remember what type of hamburger I had but I remember that it was amazing and I would go there alot of there was one near me. They have some weird combos that make you look sideways but once you have them you won't think twice about going back. They had us in and out very quickly with great service.
Only been here a couple of times due to a busy life but I would recommend this place first when it comes to an INCREDIBLE burger! Moist and succulent Wagyu beef with a fried egg and crispy onion rings on the Miyagi-San burger is just an intro to the palate. The Japanese BBQ sauce and aioli kick it out if this world! On top of all of that I got the truffle fries and now I think my burger life is ruined cause I don't want any old burger from any where else! These Truffle Fries are the BOMB! Served with a sun dried tomato aioli and drizzled with a truffle sauce and Parmesan cheese-really?! Holy freaking shazbot!! Service here is excellent(attentive, friendly, courteous)! Summer time at this restaurant is going to be busy so get here now and enjoy before the crowds invade!! I'll try the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries next time!
My rating would be 2 1/2 if that were available.. . Overpriced fro what you get and does not live up to the hype.
I was looking for a good place to eat that was not on the Strip and found this place with 4 stars and decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. Not being very hungry, we ordered the Pork belly steam bun, kiki's burger, and ronin burger.. . We went for the pork belly instead of the duck for steamed bun because it is all about the fat. They grilled the pork belly to perfection. The fluffiness and chewiness of the steamed bun combined with the crusty, melt-in-you-mouth goodness, the buns were gone in a minute.. . I was sold when I read that there is shiitake mushroom and other mushrooms in the Kiki's burger along with caramelized bacon, onion marmalade, gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli. For me to finish a burger when I am not very hungry, you know how delicious this burger is.. . My companion ordered the ronin burger with the wagyu patty and fried egg. It looked impressive, but tasted alright in comparison to my kiki's. . . Great place if you have a car when you visit Las Vegas. You will not be disappointed. Did I mention my Kiki's burger was only $11? Tell that to someone in California or New York, they'd be pissed!
Best burger joint around! I highly recommend the crab cake burger... I always make sure to order me a taro boba drink as well, yum!! Excellent restaurant to take people visiting Vegas. Fun menu and delicious food!!
Best burger in town. Baci burger and hash house are #1 - #2 respectively. The creations at Baci are superb. The slight taste of  pineapple in ketchup is a great spin on ketchup. Fried egg and onion rings on burger was the shit! 5 stars.
Absolutely the best burger in Las Vegas... or quite possibly in the US?. . Most of my experience comes from the San Francisco Bay Area, and I've tried dozens of places, if not hundreds, from cheap burger joints to upscale restaurants. Like Umami Burger, Roam Artisan Burgers, 4505 Meats, Mission Beach Cafe, SuperDuper, Chow, Marlowe, or even Spruce... Some of them were fantastic, but Bachi goes even further. My wife agrees.. . I don't know what makes us addicted to their burgers, but I'm pretty sure they put some kind of cocaine in the ingredients. We need to blow a whistle to invite DEA to stop this madness. But before doing that, please allow me to have one last bite of the Miyagi-san burger... or the Kiki burger... or the Ronin burger... or the Just Fries... oh please help me!
Decent burger but outrageously overhyped. Horrible wait around lunch time and definitely too expensive for what it was. I'd recommend a lot of other burgers before I'd ever recommend this place
They got this down. The chef is the best. He definitely knows how to please peoples pallets. amazing food and great staff. I recommend everyone to come and dine here.
I absolutely love their food, sometimes they don't have the best service but I keep coming back for the food. You can come here multiple times and try different combos. Also the best part about the restaurant it's open late.
Came here due to recommendations from my cousins who raved about it being the best place for a burger in Vegas. So on my way back home we drove by this place to give it a try.  We got here right as it opened, so there was no line to deal with.. . A friendly and enthusiastic staff member greeted us and sat us down. He asked if we had ever been to Bachi Burger and when we said no, he did a quick introduction of some of the more popular items on the menu.. . There were three of us and we got the following:. . Truffle Parmesan Fries: ($5.50) which included  Parmesan Reggiano,  black truffle cream with sun-dried tomato aioli on the side.  .  . - I thought it was decent. I didn't really taste the truffle flavor as much as I hoped for, and I preferred my fries to be a bit crispier.  I would probably pass on getting this the next time.. . BBQ Bachi Burger: ($13.00)  8 oz Grass Fed Wagyu, lettuce, tomato and onion. . . - This is the burger to get if you want a simple, juicy and flavorful burger where you let the bun and the meat shine. My friend enjoyed it thoroughly and didn't see the need for extra toppings or sauces. . . Black & Green Burger: ($14:00) American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, sauteed mushrooms, spinach, bacon, Point Reyes blue cheese,roasted garlic . . - No doubt this is a flavorful burger, just reading the ingredients makes you salivate.  My friend liked the burger and the combination of flavors. He said he would get it again.. . Shogun burger:  ($26.00): Wagyu Beef, unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached Asian pear, miso butter, and a Yamamomo Peach palette cleanser.. . - I got the ultimate flavorful and tasty burger I have ever tasted. Over indulgent, perhaps.  However, the flavors surprisingly work well together.. . Granted I was in search of foie gras coming from California which has now banned the delectable item so it was a no brainer that I chose this burger when I saw it on the menu.. . It is a very rich tasty burger and slightly oily, but that is a given. The foie gras was pan seared so it was soft and melted slightly over the beef so there was a lot of texture going on with the poached pear. . . Our waiter came to check on us after our food was delivered and told me that I should have the "Yamamomo Peach" before I eat the burger as it is a palette cleanser to prepare your tastebuds from all the flavors before you bit into the burger. Just remember that there is a small pit in the marinated peach.. . I can see that the Shogun burger is not for everyone, but I enjoyed every bite of this burger.  The menu if fairly extensive and has a little bit of something for everyone. . . Our server mentioned they plan to open a Bachi Burger near UCLA soon and another place called Healthy Life Kitchen.. . Why 4 out of 5 stars? Well, I was a bit disappointed with the truffle fries. . . Service was fine. Parking is plentiful. Prices are higher but I suppose you get what you pay for. . . I would definitely come here again if I was ever in Vegas..   . p.s. I was tempted to get the oxtail chili fries, but my companions were less adventurous. Darn!
Not at all what I expected.. The set up is all wrong from the lighting to the tables as we were being seated your running into the workers and customers theres no aisle room. My 10 yr old ordered a hamburger, when she took a bite she didnt like it so I mom switched burgers, when we got the bill I was shocked to see that the burger she ordered was $26 thats right my caring waitress never warned me that my 10 yr old was ordering a $26 burger, and to add to that it had a type of fish in it. The burgers that my husband and 18 yr old and me ordered were $12, thats why we let my daughter choose a burger we had no idea there was such a pricey burger and what waitress lets that happen, obviously not a caring one. Trust me this burger joint is not worth your money. I would suggest steak n shake burgers at South Point casino wayy better.
We had the absolute experience here.. . So when we arrived, it was around 2 and we checked in to put our name down on the waiting list. We were told that it would take around 45 minutes which is kind of crazy for a couple of burger but we walked across the street to Vons (there is nothing to do around the neighborhood). After 40 minutes we went back and saw that there was still 13 groups ahead of us. UM WHAT IN THE WORLD. I hope you seat those people in 5 minutes.. . NOPE. We waited another 45 minutes until we were called. An HOUR AND A HALF for burgers? WHAT WERE WE THINKING. So already in a bad mood, we were seated. They took our drink orders and food orders (we took a look at the menu while we were waiting).. . Now here's the best part. WE WAITED ANOTHER 30 MINUTES FOR THE FOOD TO COME. NOT EVEN THE FRIES CAME. SIMPLE FRIES THAT SHOULD TAKE MAX 10 MINUTES TO MAKE. So when we got the food we were terribly grumpy and unhappy with the service. . . The burgers were not as good as I expected and not as good as waiting total 2 hours for it. Yes, it was better quality than let's say in and out but not terrific.. . So overall, I was not angry because of the hour and a half I waited to be seated because it's not their fault that they are popular and in high demand. What is ridiculous is the fact that even after they seated us their service was like a snail's.
