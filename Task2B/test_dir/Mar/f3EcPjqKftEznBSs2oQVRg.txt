Nowhere to sit. Rude staff. Overpriced drinks as usual. As long as you come already pretty drunk and don't need to sit or talk to anyone it's a pretty nice place. Decent size dance floor. Dj is good. Bathrooms were clean and there were enough stalls so we weren't in line for an hour. Would recommend overall....
we had a long night of club hopping and this was our last stop we were told that this club was open until the early morning. . When we got there it was after 3 they called last call after 4 I live in Vegas I'm used to everything being 24 hours at a nightclub like this where we were enjoying ourselves and they called last call at 4 a.m. We were in shock
My boyfriend and I visited this beautiful place in Caesar's on a Saturday night. We got on the VIP guest list and got there early so the wait was only about 10 minutes. There were free drinks for ladies with the wristband so I enjoyed that ;). There were three bars on the main floor so I got my drinks very quickly. I love the decor - mostly white with light purple mood lighting which gives the place a cool vibe. The dance floor was packed with a lively crowd. The DJ spun a lot of 90s rap/hip-hop on the dancefloor which was perfect for the 20-30 yo's there. In the black reserved table room for lounging they played mainstream house. The only thing I regret was not getting a table because there is nowhere to sit otherwise! This place is a lot of fun for dancing and has a great vibe. Definitely check it out of you're clubbing in Vegas!
Recently moved here, celebrating my 40th birthday and my friends surprised me with this bottle service at Pure Nightclub. . . Pros:. 1) Clean bathroom. 2) Great decor. 3) Had a great host that night. . Cons:. . 1) Small dance floor that no more space to even try and dance. We just use our fingers and hands to do all the work lol. 2) One of the security guard or hosts kept letting in their guests eventhough he knew we were there first and have to wait for the signal from the other hosts. I don't know what seems to be his problem but 3 hosts already told him that we should be the next but he looked at us as if were no big deal. He just wants to rule what he wants and whom he wants to let in right away. . 3) $475 Bottle service with tax and gratuity = $653. Not even telling my friend about this situation before hand. Hmmm bottle service is kinda okay if there's 4 of you, meaning it will last for awhile and you can just keep coming back to your space. But for me, I rather do general admission and be there early coz I rather spend the $635 exploring to a great restaurants every hotels lol. . 4) It took us 30 minutes to get in eventhough we have the VIP guest list.
On a girlfriends birthday we were asked to join her here.  . . So we did.  We had a table and were moved to another (no biggie)  We had 4 bottles not a small deal in Vegas Bottle service and as the night went on we got more.  The Bottle service waitresses were awesome (why do I always feel I say that) cuz they usually are.  The moving wasn't a big deal but all of a sudden our bouncers changed as well and these guys were NOT fun or cute or pretty much anything besides annoying.  They kept asking us to move or get off this or get off that while the rest of the place was going nuts. . . My next quip is I needed a bathroom so I asked the largest guy in the room (that would be the bouncer) (right outside my gate to keep the heathens out) where the bathrooms are.  I haven't done anything wrong so I should get a decent answer.  He grudgingly tells me "it's over there" and points to my right, I say "I have to walk all the way over to the other side of the club to go pee?!" "yes" "ok" and I go and go and go through the crazy nightclub crowd I get close to the barrier and finally I see a bouncer a GIRLYES! so i ask her "I need to pee, where is the bathroom?!" "oh you have to be a VIP to use these bathrooms"  I said "I am a VIP my booth is over there he told me to go over here"   she says "nope you have to be a VIP in my section to use this bathroom"  The whole time not looking in my eyes at all.. . Are you fricking kidding me?!  VIP bouncers are the worst they think they are in charge and there is no communication they know nothing.  They don't seam to be paying attention because they can't find the bathroom and cannot accommodate a girl who's group just bought 4 bottles (more to come) no we are not 20 but we still look great and we can pay our own way.  I guess it is time to change your name and redo it so you can get a better rating.. . BTW it took me 1 hour to pee after paying for 4 bottles of booze no thanks to your bouncers!
Sorry but if you have to pay extra $$$$ to get even semi decent service & a seat to sit down every once in awhile then I need to go to a place with class. Some fake people and overpriced everything here. I'm surprised I wasn't charged to use the toilet paper.
I'm so torn because the music was AMAZING!!! I haven't heard a good set like that in a long time. Great eclectic mix - old school Beastie Boys followed up by Justin Timberlake and then No Diggity??? SO great. . . BUT the middle of the dance floor smelled so badly like vomit that we kept having to strategically maneuver ourselves away from the smell. Disgusting. And it didn't go away all night. . . Someone clean the floor of this joint!!!
I'm rating this place a 3, not because Idon't like it but more so because most people that read this are going to want to compare this to other clubs in Vegas.. . I actually love this place. It looks great with the all-white everything theme, play some great music, and a pretty sexy crowd. So why would you not like this place? Well, I love clubs that aren't much bigger or more crowded than a popping lounge. For someone looking for a legit club, this place really doesn't have the space for it nor the crowd.. . Great place for a more matured crowd.
Bottle service a must at this place because there is no need to wait in line for drinks at the bar, they constantly fill your ice bucket and even set up a round of shots for everyone.  Great music variety.  Dance floor smelled like someone vomited.  I'm not sure if its always like that or it was because someone actually did vomit there that night but I couldn't be on the dance floor for more than 5 minutes.  Luckily we had our lounge area where we were able to dance around.  I guess as a place, it's pretty good but I think I would have given this place a higher rating if the dance floor didn't smell like vomit.  But the bouncers were nice, security and the rooftop area is pretty cool also.
