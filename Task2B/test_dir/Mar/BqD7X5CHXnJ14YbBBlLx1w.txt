I had the asparagus and oxtail with mashed potatoes.... I recommend them both! Great flavor! The cervix he is great as well! Chefs and bartenders are friendly and down to earth!
The happy hour is a good deal, but the food wasn't consistently good. I ate there three time during my stay at Aria 2/23-2/28/14.  I love their bacon wrapped dates, and they were great the first day... ok the subsequent times.  Also the "Spanish Tortilla" was a cold gloopy-glue-like thing that I ended up sending back.  Their ahi tuna squares with raspberry stuff and sesame seeds are def a Vegas "must try" because they are beautiful and yummy!
The potatoes were off the chart. If you are into tapas then this place will rock your world. A few of the dishes weren't our favorite but 3-4 were really good with great flavors!
At one point Vegas got "over saturated" with Tapas restaurants. I guess that's one of Vegas "weaknesses"  Always going to extreme in everything,even restaurants or "Vapor Stores" :-). That by any  means does not affect my believe, that Vegas is  the best city  to live in (at least for me and my family).  Back to Julian Serrano: I f I would be put in front of the dilemma  to choose only one Tapas restaurant in Las Vegas to stay open. I would say Julian Serrano in a heart bit. Yes it is a little pricy, but when you bite into stuffed peppers or take a sip of house made sangria...  You feel that eating here is "money well spent" . I should also mention, please save room for desert, it's outstanding!  So is the service.
My wife, a group of friends and I were back in Las Vegas and planned to dine at Julian Serrano again.  We had dined there a few years prior and in my mind, that was the best meal I had ever had in Vegas.  I'm very happy to report that our most recent experience was just as fantastic as a few years back.  Just like the last time, we had Pedro as our waiter.  He is the absolute perfect curator for the food journey we took once again.  Not only is he attentive to all needs, he explains every dish as it's brought to the table.  He even remembered us from a few years ago which was very impressive considering the amount of people I'm sure he serves on a regular basis.  The food continues to be phenomenal with various textures and tastes all playing off of each other nicely.  We will definitely be retuning next year.  Do yourself a favor, if you find yourself in Las Vegas, go to Julian Serrano, ask for Pedro to be your host for the evening and enjoy the ride!!
I really enjoy eating at this place when I come to Vegas. The atmosphere is relaxing. Our server Ernesto was very polite and the food was awesome. Paella, papa bravas, lamb chops, ribs. The sangria mmm.. I recommend anyone who has never tried Tapas food to eat here.
Great food, decent service, wildly marked-up wine list. You should still go.
lovely spot to grab a late night dinner for two! delicious & light and left satisfied. would recommend for a larger group too, to try all that their tapas menu has to offer. . thx aria hotel, another terrific spot to dine at.  : )
I came here in a larger group for a birthday dinner and a positively amazing experience. We opted for a tasting course menu, where we able to taste several different plates. The staff was very attentive and the service was quick! My personal favorite item on the menu was the stuffed dates, delicious!! Everyone in my group loved our dinner experience and would recommend it to anyone! I hope to go back to Vegas soon and eat there again!
I think I may be generous with the 2 stars.....we were served rancid olive oil (on asparagus), crispy paella (EVERY other time it has been cooked - not al dente), and Iberico ham that was kind of 'meh.'  . . Very loud - hard to hear conversation at out 2 top.  . . Server was lukewarm, clearly not thrilled to be there.  . . My advice?  If you need to drop some money quickly use a slot machine instead.  We actually did and won a bunch of money!  At Serrano's you wont win anything but hopefully will find a bite or two of actual 'AUTHENTIC' Spanish cuisine, which is better than we did.
Great food. A bit pricey even for Vegas. The sangria a were not the best we have ever had but not the worst either. All the tapas were really good and unique. Prepare to spend some cash.
Incredible decor great menu decent service. Almost 5 stars but they blew it on the lamb kabob. Totally undercooked and raw. And a fine cut of meat wasted. Now that that's over I loved everything else. Mushroom rissoto to die for tuna cones were perfect the meatballs insane great beer and the oxtail. Sublime.  I would go again solid 4 star
I've been here several times and they never disappoint. The tapas and creative combinations are delicious. A must try when you visit Las Vegas.
We traveled for over a month in Spain, ate at many tapas restaurants in many countries. Even though Las Vegas has a lot to offer we just had to come back and try more things day after day at Julian Serrano. Amazing tapas, original, super tasty. We tried 8 different Tapas including the Paella, none of them failed us!. . We would come back to try some more in our next trip.
Tapas in Vegas? Why, not? This little bodega is a cute spot with excellent service! Located inside the Aria it was a short walk from our stay at the Vdara. I love me some Spanish tapas so wanted to check out this place while in town. . . Some of the dishes were spot on yummy. The calamari a la plancha with a hint of lemon and lightly charred was Delish! Another favorite was the bacon wrapped dates. Savory dates, crispy bacon and smooth goat cheese- I couldn't get enough of these bad boys. Literally, there were only 3. . . Chicken croquettes were a bit too soft inside, lacking a bit of texture I like more shredded chicken, not from the blender. . . I would order the mussels again but not the stuffed peppers. . . You cannot leave without ordering the vino tinto sangria! With apples and a hint of cinnamon, this was to die for! And the almond flan was out of this world good!. . Excellent service, good recommendations, cute spot in the Aria and great food. I would come back but bring a bigger check book- this place is not easy on the wallet considering the size of portions.
We were impressed by  every dish that we ordered. People are right about the price, whereas, this place is not cheap.  But this has definitely been one of those instances of getting what we paid for.
Food was decent.  Between four hungry gentlemen we got away with 8 small plate tapas and one paella and everyone was quite full afterwards.  It's a nicely decorated restaurant in Aria. Here are some thoughts on the food:. . - Meatballs - these had an excellent texture and the meat sauce was perfectly sweetened.  A very enjoyable dish. - Sliders - don't get this - only came with two sliders and the bread was a bit dry and overall not very original or inspired. - Black rice - this is an actual dish and I found very delectable.  The price soaked in squid ink (?) was well seasoned and the octopus and seafood added some interesting texture to the bite. - Tuna sashimi on seaweed salad - I would not order this, just get it at an actual japanese restaurant and you'll be much happier. - Paella - definitely order this when you sit down as it takes 40 mins to cook.  We ordered the mix paella and it was very enjoyable.  The mix of chicken and seafood was nice and it wasn't overly salty.. - Garlic Chicken - this was a surprisingly tasty dish.  It was simple but the flavor was excellent and the texture of the chicken was moist and soft on the inside with a thin but noticeable flour based covering.. . The cocktails were OK but nothing to write home about.  . . Why did it only get three stars?  Well our waiter who was a nice chap throughout the meal offered us an appetizer, a feta cheese, tomato, and bread type of dish.  When he offered this to us, he said "i'll bring you out this appetizer".  At the end of the meal, when we ordered 4 espressos, he said "i'm going to bring you out coffee with liquer".  In both cases, his tone gestures insinuated that we would be comped these small "extras" but when we saw the final bill, he had charged us.  The coffee drinks alone were $14 each.  Anyways, just an annoying thing for people to have to deal with and presumptuous that we'd want to pay for the extras.  . . So all in all, the food was above average but the incident with the waiter brought down the otherwise delightful experience to two stars.
The tapas here never disappoint, but the service is a real wild-card you should beware of. For a venue like this where you are going to be ordering several small plates that need to be paired properly, insight into what is good that day or what flavors will work well together often rely on input from the server (who is there every day). In my case, the server (Victor H) was not very engaged in the customers, another staff guy ( a cook) noticed that I needed a sharp knife for the lamb dish and provided one (which Victor should have recognized). The server also needed to be prompted by the staff cook to suggest other items and to follow-up on my needs. . I have been here three or four times and the food is always good, but the service, like I mentioned, will make for a great experience, or damage it.
Had 4 more hours till my flight to leave Vegas, walked by this place decided to check it out. Good thing i did, because i discovered a great place. Ordered short ribs here expecting it to be like korean short ribs lol; it was 10 times better. I huge slab of meat on a bone that melts in your mouth as you eat it, so tender and juicy. This place will make your taste buds go nuts, everything is packed with rich flavor. Happy hours from 4-5:30pm i was lucky enough to come during that time, had myself a 5 dollar sangria. Located inside the ARIA this place is a must try for everyone, guarantee you will not be disappointed.
Food was decent. Service was super fast and friendly. The menu had great selections on it. Downside? Though everything we tried was good it was simply lacking the "wow" experience that I have had at other tapas places. When I walked away from here I remembered an enjoyable meal whereas when I walked away from other tapas places I remembered specific dishes that I would look forward to having again.
Lively and beautiful atmosphere with food that is really quite delicious! We had a table of 8 and decided to go with a bunch of shared plates. Id say the three highlights were the oxtail, the duck confit, and the wrapped dates.  Even something simple as the charcuterie plate was ordered twice we loved it so much. . . We saw many people ordering paella, but we wanted to taste many dishes so we opted out. I'm picky with paella, but something tells me they do it right!!
Great food and great wine recommendations. Gotta check out the bathrooms also. Beautiful.
We got the seared scallops, eggplant special of the day, mushroom risotto, and the filet w/ foie gras, all good dishes, but not great, which brings me to the next point... For just those few middle of the road tapas dishes and a couple of drinks, I left feeling a bit ripped off. I don't mind paying a lot for food, but this place didn't quite live up to my expectations. Other than that, the food came out fairly quickly since the dinner rush hadn't come, and our server is very attentive.
