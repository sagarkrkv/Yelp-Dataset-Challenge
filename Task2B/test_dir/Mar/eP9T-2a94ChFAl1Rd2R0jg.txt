A diamond in the rough.. . This is a lengthy review consisting of three parts; overview, concerns, and people that made our trip special. . . Part I:. . We made our reservation through the blind-bid through Hotwire. We did get an excellent deal but we made up for that with the amount we spent once there. :) This trip was for our eighth anniversary and I wanted it to be really special. When we had our reservation confirmed I called to ask if I could pay to upgrade to a strip view. I was told I could. Once I made the plan to do that and then started asking about some items such as flowers for the room I was asked about the occasion. Barbara, the in-house reservation specialist told me that she was going to upgrade our room for free because of our anniversary. What a pleasant act of kindness that was very appreciated. Not only that but she ensured  that we had a high room with, the best view of the strip one could imagine.. . . The room was large and modern. The bed extremely comfortable and the bathroom huge. The Jacuzzi tub was a nice touch as was the enormous shower and the tv build into the bathroom mirror. The room was clean. Even better than I had planned when I made the arrangements, rose petals covered the floor, bed, and Jacuzzi tub and the flowers I had ordered were beautiful and centered in the room in front of the huge window overlooking the strip. . . Throughout our stay we used in-room dining several times. All were exceptional though a bit pricey. The food was great (for the most part) and the speed and quality of service was fantastic. Well worth it. I had also ordered chocolate covered strawberries and a fruit plate which were brought up by in-room dining shortly after we arrived. Delicious and well presented. . . The hotel has wifi included in the resort fee and it was fast. Also included in the resort fee were valet parking (we flew in so that was not used) and a courtesy shuttle to the Wynn and Caesar's Palace. We used the Caesar's shuttle several times a day.  It was an excellent option. Typically it ran every 15 minutes and only once did we even have to wait that long and in that case it was 20 minutes. Other than that it was around the 8 to 10 minute mark. The shuttle drivers were great and I will talk about one in more detail later.. . The concierge's desk was very helpful via phone prior to arrival (arranging the flowers, rose petals, chocolates, and fruit) and during our stay arranging trips, reservations, and limousine service. . . Since the spa experience was so amazing I will talk about that in the last section of this review. . . Part II:. . Though our stay was truly special there are a few reasons I did not rate this hotel a 5. Frankly, aside from the people I will talk about in the final part of this review, the customer service was lacking.. . The housekeeping staff was awful and did whatever they felt like regardless of the "housekeeping request" or "do not disturb" lights being lit. When they did come in they just "straightened up" and did not vacuum or sweep. In fact, the common hallways were vacuumed only once during our stay and it was after we had been there almost a week. When we wanted our room cleaned it wasn't, when we didn't they came in anyways and straightened up.. . The train....almost every review has the same complaint and our is no different. We were on the front of the hotel 56 floors up and we still heard the train constantly. All hours of the day and night we heard that god-awful horn blaring. It was so bad that during our couple's massage in the heart of the hotel and in an interior room we were awaken from our relaxation by the blaring of the horn. Trump should pay the company to place a sound tunnel over the tracks adjacent to the hotel.. . The doors to the rooms and the shared foyer are extremely heavy and almost impossible to keep from slamming. Almost slammed my finger in once at night trying to keep it from slamming. Our neighbors later on in our stay did not care so much about that and slammed the main door and their door several times a night. It was loud and paired with the train made for a difficult night's sleep.. . Part III:. . I am running out of space so I want to close with some people who made the trip special. Louis, one of the shuttle drivers, was so friendly and caring. He was such a pleasure to interact with we were disappointed when he wasn't the driver. The Spa staff was phenomenal especially Danyelle and our massage therapists Gretchen and Rafael who were professional and did an excellent job. Catalina did my wife's hair and makeup for our anniversary dinner and was so fun and professional. She did an excellent job. The spa even worked with me to have a rose waiting for my wife for that appointment. They went down stairs to the gift shop to buy a rose and bring it up so that my wife wouldn't know about it until she saw it. Thanks Danyelle!. . Overall, it was a splendid trip and a wonderful experience. I recommend the Trump Hotel Las Vegas.
We stayed at the Trump Hotel on a recent stay in Vegas and I have good and bad opinions - . . Good - the bed was very comfortable and the room had plenty of space.  The bathroom was beautiful with a spa tub and huge shower.  The shuttle service to Caesers Palace was very convenient and the shuttle drivers were all very personable.  The front desk clerk was super friendly when we checked in.. . Bad - "City View" is on the back side of the hotel and there is a train track that runs back there.  We were on the 47th floor and the train whistle was still loud in the morning.  I would suggest upgrading to the other side of the hotel which would be a view of the mall.. . The location is not far from the strip but if you like to walk it is definitely off the beaten path a bit.  My husband and I walked back after midnight and there is no way I would have felt comfortable alone.  On the strip I am never worried.. . Good/Bad - obviously there is no casino at this hotel.  I liked it because it was quieter and easy to access the rooms but when my husband wanted to go to bed and I wanted to stay up it was a bummer to not have the option to stay up by myself in an onsite casino.. . All in all I slept comfortably (minus the train) but given what I like to do in Vegas (stay up late and gamble) I think I will stay elsewhere next time.
This is the worst hotel in Las Vegas.  The cost is over priced, the rooms are very old school and the staff is not accommodating.  My boy friend got injured from the stupid revolving door and he got a black eye and was bleeding.  They didn't even cover any medical costs and just provided ice packs.. Shouldnt they have at least comped our stay or given us a free nights stay for next time.  Even if they did provide me with a free night i probably would have not came back but at least I would not be on Yelp right now giving them this horrible review!  The T.V's in the mirrors are pointless.  There is really nothing to do at this hotel... NEVER going back.
My husband and I were in Las Vegas for the weekend celebrating our 5 year wedding anniversary. The first night we stayed at the "Four Seasons" and the second night, we stayed at the "Trump International Hotel". . . The staff was OK, not very accommodating. They lack the WOW factor when it comes to customer service, IMO. . . My room smelled like week old cigarettes. I wanted to call down about the room smell, but I was so exhausted I didn't even care to deal with it. . . They did have nice jacuzzi tub with the jets. That was a nice touch. But I wouldn't stay here again.
This place was great. I got it for 69 dollars a night by using priceline and selecting 5 star strip hotels, this was about 20 dollars less per night than their website price. This was over Thanksgiving a few years ago. Upon checking in I negotiated with the check in person and got upgraded to a larger strip view room for 10 dollars a night and a 20 dollar tip. You still have to pay a resort fee if you book online through another source- but that was like 12 dollars - I'm not sure if the resort fee is covered in their online price.   Since then a few sets of family members have stayed there as well and they all liked it.. . There is no casino inside the Trump- so if you want to gamble without leaving your hotel this is not the place for you. While considered "on the strip" it is actually about 2 blocks back from Las Vegas Blvd right across a small side street from fashion show mall (if you stay here eat at stripburger for sure). It is about a 5 minute walk from the Wynn. . . The rooms are designed like condos- single open room and bathroom. The room is large, has a king bed, and a small kitchen area with a fridge and stove. The bathroom is very nice with a huge shower, tub, and there is a TV built into the mirror. The bed/beddings were very nice , as was the furniture in the small sitting area. The Tv is about 40 inches so nothing spectacular. Theinside of the hotel- the hallways, the entrance etc. are all very nice and since it is a smaller property there wasn't a long wait to check in, millions of people standing around in the lobby etc. I had a drink at the bar downstairs and it was good but not great. . . The fitness area was very nice- there was free bottled water and headphones. All the equipment was in working order and seemed like it had been kept clean.
Hotel was awesome. Beautiful relaxing and the like. Rooms were huge and the staff was attentive to anything we may have needed. . Why then did I give it only one star?? Well for two reasons. First thing that is really not that big a deal is the gold on the windows really messed with our eyes. In the rooms it creates a weird hue on everything that you look at... Eh not a big deal. . . The main issue we had was - we booked and prepaid for our rooms in advance online. 6 weeks later while going through my credit card statement I noticed that they not only charged me again for the rooms - but they charged me what it would have costed if I had been a walk-in guest not booked months in advance (OVER DOUBLE!) like we did. . . This is a real pity because we really enjoyed ourselves.
The room was amazing with an awesome view.  It was very big especially for only two people.  Unfortunately,  the room was the only positive thing about the hotel.  The lobby was impersonal and had only item of decoration.  The pool was small and by 10am there was no sitting area available.  There was nothing special, no employee really left a lasting impression.
Better late than never ! Loved the Trump Las Vegas !! We had an awesome room - 1 bedroom 2 bathrooms / dining space / living room. Stayed 7 nights. It was amazing. Loved the pool - food at the pool bar was delicious. Large portions / very tasty. Room service food was also incredible !! The shuttle bus to Encore and Ceasars was so convenient. Really enjoyed our stay - our room - would definitely come again!! Thanks so much Trump !
This hotel is not managed like a five star hotel. There was trash behind the night stands, cracks in the lamp shades in our room as well as damaged shades throughout the hotel. I also found the room to be dirty around the windowsills and dust on some of the furniture.  Our room was also not stocked fully with the normal toiletries. The ice maker on our floor was not working either. When I mentioned the outage to the front desk staff their response was told me that there was an ice maker on every floor and I was welcome to use one of them. I had to complain two different times before the problem was resolved. Most of the staff was accommodating and it should be noted that our tipping of the staff for their service was not affected due to the poor management of the hotel. If this is how Trump properties are run I would not ever consider staying at one again.
Wow! we love this place. 1 bedroom suite was perfect for two. The service is amazing, the staff very accomodating, yet aloof at times ( keep reading).  It's off the strip yes, and it affords a level of refuge from sthe visual overload that is Vegas.  More stars if the computer system had not overcharged by $600, and a disengenous  wait staff that appears to cater only to the "male" customers in an disgustinly obvious attempt to garner tips.. More than once, my wife was ignored by the staff in order to attend to men waiting for service. I, on the other hand, reveived 5 star service and attention.. Overall a good trip.
Stayed here while at a convention.  It was very pleasant; tastefully decorated, very little cigarette smoke, no casino to push through.. . Didn't get to use the pool or try any of the restaurants, but our room was beautiful and very comfortable.  Especially loved the kitchenette and the bathtub which was so big it was practically a Jacuzzi.  And we all got a huge kick out of the tv built into the bathroom mirror!. . Convenient location to tour some of my favorite, more upscale hotels on the strip.  Also right next door to a huge mall with lots of fun shopping and restaurants.. . All in all, a very relaxing, upscale place to kick back in Vegas.  I would definitely stay there again, and soon!
Super helpful staff!!. Ran into some car trouble and valet staff was very helpful, called to have the car towed to dealer, and they had a hotel car drive us back while it was repaired!. Room is huge and spacious, shower and bath separate. Bath is huge, cozy for any couple. . House keeping we're very respectful of our items, and rabbit lounging around the room.. No casino, which is a fantastic get away after a long night.. . It was a great experience.
I have stayed here a few times and I think this will be my last visit.  The staff has always been great to me so there is that.  Also I love that there is no casino.  However I am just amazed this place has a 5 star rating. I would be interested in finding out how long the ratings last.. . *the curtains in my room were not even connected to the rods that you are supposed to use to close them. *every single piece of furniture has multiple dents and scratches. *why have a kitchen with no utensils. It says you can call housekeeping for any items you need. I stay at a five star hotel so that I don't have to call for anything. It should be right the first time.. *very dusty. *the glass table was disgusting. *the carpet outside of the elevator was very bunched up and I could easily see people who have trouble walking tripping and falling.. *the walls/wallpaper is torn in places. *the ironing board was completely bent and would not stand straight. . . . Bottom line is this place is not being maintained well. I'm sure if I called to say how dirty the room was and mentioned the ironing board it would have been taken care of. The thing is AT FIVE STAR HOTELS EVERYTHING SHOULD BE PERFECT THE FIRST TIME.  I pay more to not deal with these issues and not waste my time.  Great people/staff but I doubt if it can maintain the 5 star rating.
If you own a cell phone and want to use it do not stay here. From ten steps in zippo signal.
Had a very positive experience at this hotel. It is very beautiful and clean! I love that there is NO casino! You are away from the strip but close enough to all the fun! The elevators are super fast so you don't have to worry about waiting too long for an elevator. Plus they have 2 separate ones depending on your floor number. . . My boyfriend and I stayed in a king suite with not the greatest view...(but who really stays at hotels for views?) The bed was comfy...I've slept on better but it wasn't bad! I did hear the train that some reviewers mentioned but it's not noisy for more than a minute! The closet had 2 soft full sized bathrobes.. . On to the bathroom...wow! Absolutely amazing! You get a fricken jacuzzi in your suite!!!! And a built in tv in the mirror?! I loved the his/hers sinks and the separate shower/toilet area. . . The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the valet only parking! There were a few times we forgot some things in our car and thought it would've been easier going to our car looking for what was needed instead of asking one of the workers! We parked at the mall across the way a few times that we knew we were going to be in and out of the hotel. . . Overall, this hotel was great and I would stay again!
Pretty hotel with slightly outdated decor. The location is pretty good, and the hotel offers free shuttle services to Caesar's Palace and the Wynn.. . The rooms are huge. They come with a nice kitchenette, livingroom with pull out bed, nice bed room and 2 bathrooms. You can easily fit 4 (or more) in these rooms.. . There isn't a casino in this hotel, so it isn't super loud or smokey in the public areas. But it is Vegas....and not having a casino is sometimes a con.. . The main problem is the lack of cell service. I'm not sure what it is, but cell reception is absolutely terrible in this hotel. They do have wifi, but ours didn't work until right before we checked out.. . Not my first choice hotel when I'm in Vegas, but it's definitely not a terrible choice either.
Hilton Grand Vacation owner. So this review is based on being an owner. . . Stayed in a studio suite for 3 nights on the 20th floor.  The valet only option was pretty cool. Seemed like a hassle at first but we never waited more then 7 minutes for our car. The rooms are spacious. The TV on the mirror in the bathroom is a great added touch. The spa tub is big enough for two, as well as the shower. . . Room service was friendly & so was the housekeeping staff when we needed extra amenities since there is no cleaning when you're an owner. . . The $20 resort fee is waived as an owner.. . Will definitely stay again.
The rooms are great, the bathroom is fantastic! The food in the lobby restaurant is outstanding! The only drawback is the loud train that seems to be in your room in the middle of the night! The horn seems endless! Unfortunately, it manages to ruin the whole stay & is the only reason I probably won't stay here again.
First off, my rating does not reflect on anything connected with the valet, lobby service, or general customer service.  That was actually very representative of what Mr. Trump expects out of his people.   I was recommended this hotel by someone who frequents Trump quite a bit and gave it a try while I was in town.  The two star rating is reflective of my experience in the room itself.  First off, the mattress sucked.  I've stayed at several strip hotels that have extremely plush, comfortable mattresses (Encore, Wynn, Palazzo, THEhotel, etc..)  This one was hard and felt cheap.  Second, I turned the shower on and realized the knob's hot switch was actually the opposite of what it says...Not a huge deal but when you expect a certain standard to be met, it is very noticeable.  All of the entrance doors are extremely loud and wake you up in the middle of the night.  Lastly, our window vent was broken causing us to hear every siren and loud exhaust car on the strip....all night.  Not my idea of first class.
Stayed here for EDC last year and my friends and I absolutely LOVED it. . Since we weren't looking to survive the entire 3 day electronic music festival (8pm to 7am) we were not looking to hit up the strip much during the day. . . No casino-great to get away from the hustle and bustle. Pool area- Relaxing and plenty of places to lounge around. Spacious gym. Clean, well kept. Shuttle to the strip!. . ROOMS ARE HUGE! And the one we got had a great kitchen area with a mini fridge, stove tops, microwave, toaster and even a BLENDER! Fanastic Curtains that block out all the sun (perfect when you are trying to be nocturnal). Desk and sofa area. Huge bed. Fancy bathtub, TVs, spacious shower. . . Couldn't have asked for a better place or deal for what we needed.
I stayed here on a business trip, and while off the strip, I would absolutely stay here again.  It's a short walk from the strip, and across the street is one of the main shopping malls, which you can walk thru to get to the strip if its raining or just too-d*mn-hot out.  If you don't want to walk, you can get the free shuttle to Caesar's (down strip) or the Wynn (just across the street).. . The rooms are VERY spacious, with a large jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, as well as a tv in the mirror and a glass-enclosed shower.  Views toward the Mirage look down to the pool, which is resort style and really great.  There are bright lights, though, that shine from the pool upward at night right into the rooms - not that it's bright that you can't sleep or anything but more that you can't enjoy the view AS much with the bright lights.. . If you have some time while here, make sure you spend time at the pool - with a bar on the pool deck, you have no reason not to get some sun. . . Note: There IS A RESORT FEE ( I think every hotel in Vegas has one now ) each night per room.  It "includes" wifi, pool use, and other resort features, but keep this in mind when booking on other sites like Expedia and Priceline as this fee is not usually included in those rates.  . . Also, there is NO CASINO is this hotel.  Which can be amazing ( I thought so ) and can be a downer.  I would absolutely recommend this hotel when coming to Las Vegas.
