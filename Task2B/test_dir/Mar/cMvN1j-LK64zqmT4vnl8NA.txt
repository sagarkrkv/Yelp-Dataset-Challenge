Had a late lunch here on my last trip to Vegas.  Started with chips and salsa, the salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just a hint of spiciness  Tried a couple of the tacos and the Lucky 6 dim sum.  Great flavors all the way around but the dim sum stood out more than the tacos did.. . Service was pretty decent and the menu has lots of things I'd like to try.  I will definitely put China Poblano towards the top of my list to try again the next time I'm in Vegas.
My only regret about China Poblano is that I didn't go sooner. I've lived in Vegas for a few years and finally made it here on National Margarita Day. I had their signature salt "air" margarita. It's not really air, but salty foam that floats on top of your drink. Not only is it super cool and inventive, but it gives you a hint of salt in every sip. Delicious!. . Even though Jose Andres, the Spanish chef behind China Poblano, is world renowned, I was curious to see how he'd do Mexican food. I grew up eating Mexican food and am very picky. All my cynicism was gone as soon as I read the menu. The queso fundido, a melted cheese appetizer served by nearly every Mexican restaurant, is made with queso Menonita. Most of you have probably never heard about it, but that's what queso fundido is SUPPOSED to be made with (not Monterey cheese most restaurant use.) To know Chef Andres has it imported from Mexico is really special. . . All the food we tried was great, especially the tuna ceviche. The one thing we had that was kind of blah were the tacos. That's why I'm not giving it five stars. You can find way better tacos in nearly every taco shop at a fraction of the price. Even the $10 lobster taco ($10 for one, little taco) was just okay. Nevertheless, I can't wait to go back again for margaritas and queso!
I was extremely surprised at the number of poor reviews put on this place! The concept of a Chinese/Mexican fusion should involve the unique and bold flavor that is typical of the two cultures. The flavors here were authentic, creative, and well put together and exactly what a fusion of these two cultures should be. I will definitely be returning here and encourage true food lovers to explore this wonderful place as well
Went here on a Saturday it was pretty full, so we took a seat at the bar. We were quickly approached by the bartender, she was very knowledgable about the tequila and various other spirits. Her recommendations on he tequila she served us were right in the money. As for the food, we tried several different tacos pork, short rib, lobster, fish. They were small but very tasty. We also enjoyed the fish and chips as well as her recommendations of some shumai with quail egg on it. They were really really good. I love andres, and before you go in there, as a diner should always have an idea if what you're gonna pay; to me it was just about right.  The fusion of Asian and Spanish inspired dishes is interesting and something you don't see everywhere. Of course I wish portions were bigger, but there is a lot of detail placed in these small plates. I would recommend everyone go to a Jose andres restaurant at some point in their lives.
Loved it. Chinese and Mexican tapas. I would give it 5 stars but the prices for drinks    are a bit much. $18.00 for a gin and tonic and $15.00 for a margarita. Yes, the drinks were good but not that good. Service was great,nice, attentive and cleared empty plates quickly. Onto the food. We had the following, sorry don't remember specific names of things. . 1. Taco - yummy and authentic. 2. Spring rolls- a bit greasy but delicious. 3. Odon noodles- very spicy. 4. Dumplings- very good. 5. 20 vegetable fried rice- omg it's a must try and add beef or chicken for more deliciousness. . . So these 5 items are plenty for two people. This and the 2 drinks= $ 117.00 before tip. . Will I back.....you betcha!
China Poblano is such a waste of money. DO NOT COME HERE! As I was walking through Cosmopolitan, I didn't really pay much attention to this little Asian-Mexican joint because it looked like an unappetizing fast food spot, BUT what did catch my eye was Jose Andres' name plastered in front of the restaurant.  I've fallen in love with Jose Andres ever since my enjoyable experience at The Bazzar so I just had to try it.  Of course I knew it wasn't going to be the same, but this just wasn't even good... for any type of standard.  I wanted to try an item from both sides so I opted for the lobster taco and their dan dan mian noodles.  The lobster taco was about $10 and the noodles were around $16?  Both were extremely overpriced for what I got and I honestly don't mind forking out the cash for good food, but this did not even come close.  The portions were extremely small for both, not to mention that my lobster taco was soggy.  The dan dan mian noodles were supposed to be one of their more popular items and I can tell you that there are about a million places in 626 that do it better for about $6.  I regret coming here and should've just gone to Secret Pizza.  China Poblano, how dare you taint Jose Andres' reputation like that!!
Their margaritas are definitely 5 stars!!  The 20 vegetable fried rice was good but for $26 (we got shrimp added), I should have been able to eat for days off of it.  Not sure if I will come back but if I do I will get a margarita.
I'm a Las Vegas food and wine writer by trade, so I learned a long time ago to take the good with the bad and focus on writing about the positives of a dining experience while ignoring the variables that can sometimes detract from an otherwise solid establishment. However, I feel that my most recent unpleasant experience at China Poblano requires me to issue a warning to future diners, and that is to STAY AWAY. Seriously, avoid this place and save your money. I used to absolutely love this place, the food was fabulous and unique, the drinks were delicious and creative, and the ambiance was festive and hip. The service has always been aloof and full of bad attitude (Save for a delightful bartender named Steve who was there when they opened but has since moved on to more hospitable pastures.), but I chalk that up to the general attitude of the Cosmopolitan - which generally has the worst service on the strip across the board. Since they opened, I've chosen to overlook that and make this my go to for entertaining clients and out of town guests in a casual setting as it really did have top notch food and a cozy atmosphere. Alas, that is no more. It's been a couple of months since I dined with them, and apparently there has been an overhaul on the menu. The dishes are still tasty, however they have downsized many of them to tapas-like portions while keeping the prices the same (they were once reasonable, now they're typical strip mark-up). This was irritating, but not shun-worthy. That was reserved for the service that has gone from disinterested to disdainful. Our server, Richard, I admit had a sweet personality and an adorable smile - that is for the two minutes when he greeted us and took our order. Once he did that we literally never saw him again until he brought us our check. This was not his fault, he was clearly the only bartender on duty. Why they had him waiting tables as well while the bar was busy was beyond me. My companion and I each ordered salads. Her, the beet and avocado (which was my favorite until now - it's been pared down to a tiny fraction of what it once was.) and I the tuna ceviche (which could have been excellent had it not been drowning in an over abundance of lemon and soy). The pathetic excuse for a beet salad came out a full 10 minutes before my ceviche did. I waited for our server to notice, even attempting to flag him down, but he never bothered to come over. I finally stopped the tall, bald corpse of a manager (you'll know exactly who I mean if you see him) to ask if perhaps I might get my lunch before my companion finished. His response was a dippy 'Well, ya know we have two kitchens so stuff doesn't always come out together, your server should have told you that'. That is the single worst excuse I've ever heard, and frankly, as I learned as a server many years ago it is unacceptable to EVER take out only part of a table's order. Not only was the service terrible but the manager was so annoyed that his diners would dare to ask to receive their food at the same time that he couldn't contain his disdain. I feel just awful that I inconvenienced him so by intruding upon his establishment to order food. I felt that unwelcome. No matter - I will never take another guest there again and I hope to save many a dear Yelp reader from wasting their hard earned dollar on such nasty service and portions of food fit to starve a hamster. I will happily (and very vocally) never ever darken China Poblano's door ever again.
Great place.  The Huitlocoche and Mushroom dish is gone but the Mongolian beef with lettuce is fantastic.  Definitely recommend.
This was an odd experience for both my Fiancee and I. We both love Mexican and Chinese food so to find a restaurant that fused the two cultures together should have been a home run for us.. . It sadly wasn't. We ordered a sampling of dishes to share and the only one I liked was the shrimp mojo. It was sweet with a hint of smoke and tangy spice. I liked them a lot. Our Sui Mui had a weird fishy aftertaste and made us both a little nervous. The Taco we ordered was a good weird. I'd try it again if I had an opportunity.. . Price was to be expected being on the strip but I'll never get used to paying $5 for an 8 ounce bottle of Coke. . . I'd stop here again if someone else said they wanted to try it or we had tickets to a show at the Cosmopolitan but all in all its not someplace I'd highly recommend.
Wow! I can't get enough of this place. I went two days in a row during my last Vegas trip. . . We were a group of 4 so we had a chance to try a lot of dishes- everyone was top notch. I recommend the chilaquiles, queso fundido and the wonton soup. . . Note: The prices are high relative to the portions but I can live with that since it's Vegas baby.
To be honest, I was really skeptical when my friends told me we were going to a Chinese-Mexican fusion restaurant. I like them mutually exclusively & never got on the fusion food bandwagon. I went in a party of 6, and we shared everything family style - that's the way to go! . . Sitting on the "patio" is a great place for people watching, as it's across the way from Marquee and the other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan. . . Some highlights from our meal:. - Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice: absolutely delicious and strongly scented of sesame.. - Chilaquiles: the Menorita cheese was so melty, salty and perfect. - Shrimp Mojo: Light spice. I like the addition of the black garlic. - Kao Lao Lao: Little rolled noodle sheets served with a fermented vegetable sauce. Very rich, umami flavor. - I didn't personally get the duck tongue tacos, but those that did were blown away!. . My only gripe was the price of alcohol. On a whim, we decided to order a pitcher of margarita & a few a la carte drinks - which pushed our $200 meal to well over $300. Oopsies, should have looked at the price beforehand. They were mediocre, so pre-party elsewhere.. . Yes, there will be haters that say the prices are too high, but this is Vegas. It's food by Jose Andres, for heavens sake...
Excellent place.  5 of us went there for dinner after a business conference.  The waiter was excellent - recommended a drink tequila mixed drink for the table which was very good (grapefruit/tequila/lime mixed drink in a pitcher).  Excellent tasting food - we had tacos, spring rolls, lamb pot stickers, noodles, mongolian beef - all very good.  We will definitely go back.
Went here again last night with my sister. You gotta love this place! so many unique dishes on the menu, and their service is the best. We met an awesome guy named Miller who was our waiter. We talked a little bit about where we were both from, he gave us plenty of time to look at the menu and was super nice. And he made sure we got everything we needed. A couple times the food runner brought the wrong stuff and Miller was quick to get it switched. I totally recommend this place to anyone who likes mexican or asian cuisine. Its an "experience" to be enjoyed.
I am very turmoiledabout this place. I've seen it several times and my guitar instructor/friend has been here 5 times and loved it every time. I had big expectations. . . Thursday night, the middle of the Pac 12 tournament week around 9 o'clock in the evening. Not too crowded but people were scattered around the edges of the restaurant. With all the room in the restaurant, we end up sitting at a table against a wall nestled in between about 4 other tables a super tight sardine type squeeze. . . Our red headed male waiter did not come around for awhile, but we watched him attend to the table directly to the right of us and a few tables left of us. I kind of felt like we were playing that childhood game, Red Rover, wondering if I was ever going to get picked and the anticipation was killing me! I just wanted to order. . . He finally comes over with his rehearsed speech. Yes, my hubby and I order margaritas, and then he disappears for a long time again before we get to order food.. . Fast forward sometime later.. The guacamole and chips, hubby's choice, make their appearance first. Very good stuff. Not mind blowing but definitely worth a try!. . I enjoyed my "air" foam topped margarita and my chili pepper spicy margarita. I had one of the most unique tacos I ever had - a duck tongue - lychee corn tortilla taco. Although I really enjoyed the duck taco, I definitely liked the beef lengua taco more since the duck tongue taco was too unique for my tastes. I also loved the Hao Gao dim sum - the insides combined pork and shrimp when its usually just shrimp. Very tasty stuff. The six pieces disappeared in my tummy quickly!. . I also ordered a carnitas taco, but it never came out. I inform the waiter of this and he said I never ordered it. I could have sworn that I did. What happens next? We receive our check, and the carnitas taco was on the bill! The supposed taco that I never ordered! I think the manager noticed my dejected look. He came over and asked us if we were okay and we told him what happened. Our waiter never returned but the manager helped make the correction on the bill and sincerely apologized. . . My summary: Food very interesting! Manager and hostess very friendly and nice. Waiter - I think you were having an off day or honestly forgot about us. You probably were tired or overworked and were ready to be done with the day. We had come in from a long road trip and just wanted to relax and have drinks and food. It was just a bad date between us and the restaurant that night.
Came here on a Friday night. It was packed. I would say make reservations, which my group did, but that didn't help us any because we were still seated about 45 mins after our reservation time.. . The chips, salsa and guacamole were all really good. Chips were perfectly cooked and warm when served. Seasoned nicely. I got the fish tacos which were delicious. Everyone else seemed to like what they got too:  steamed buns, chicken tacos, noodles.
apas style with East meets... South? Chinese-Mexican fusion. Had the grapefruit vanilla Margarita which was light and refreshing for the warm weather. The chips and salsa are not that great. The chips are fresh though, and the salsa has a smokey flavor to it. . . I ordered the Silencio, the taco with duck tongue with lychee. It was a little on the salty side, but the flavors complimented each other. Definitely spicy!. . Ordered When Pigs Fly, which was your basic bao (steamed pork bun). Nothing special really. Linda small to what I am personally used to back home.. . The Dan Dan Moan noodle was noodles in a self-mix sauce noodle dish. It was alright. The sauce was kinda plain, noodles more doughy than expected. Not bad, worth a try.. . Ordered the Ocean's Nest. Okay, it was Hong Kong style pan fried chow mein, with lobster. Still not impressed and definitely not worth $46.. . The Empanada de Pollo con Mole Poblano was really good. The mole was complex, savory, rich, and authentic tasting. The outside was crispy, and the meaty filling was cooked just right.. . For dessert, the Mango Sticky Rice was hyped up by our server. She described it as "light and refreshing," which it totally was. The rice was actually toasted rice krispies sprinkled on too of a coconut creme whipped topping. The mango underneath was so sweet and delectable, very nice finish to the meal. . . Overall, it was a great place to try. I personally like the Asian food back home. The Mexican food had a near modern twist, and the drinks were great and surprisingly strong. I give it 3 stars for food and price, it was expensive for what you get, but great service! Very attentive, sociable, and polite.
The fish tacos are amazing.  The rest of the asian-mexican fusion is average.  Some of the food didn't work and some of the food just was not asian-mexican fusion.  I was looking fwd to some creative mixes but found none.
Tapas style Mexican & Chinese food (not fusion tho! They are not meshing the Asian favors with the Mexican flavors). I was recommended this place, but was iffy about trying it because it was two very different foods in the same restaurant... I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but I gave them a chance anyways and I'm so glad I did! My friend and I absolutely loved this place!!! We sat at the bar and started with an awesome pomegranate margarita topped with salted FOAM rather then the traditional salted rim. Every dish we got we were completely satisfied with and we're looking forward to our next trip back to Vegas so that we can eat here again! I highly recommend the Tuna Ceviche, Golden pig BBQ pork buns, and the mango "sticky rice" dessert.  Oh, another plus- our server was super friendly and outgoing :)
I wasn't too huge a fan of this place. We started with their guacamole ($15) which was okay - nothing to rave about. I also had their $13 empanadas de pollo con mole poblano which I was very excited about. When I received it though it was covered in oil and had absolutely no flavor. Lastly, I had their carnitas taco which is set at $5.50 and that is the reason my rating is at a 3 instead of a 2. The carnitas taco was the best. The other girls at my table ate nothing but tacos and they both agreed the carnitas was the best. The plates here are very small. If you want an actual dinner I definitely recommend going elsewhere as this place is more like tapas (similar to his restaurant upstairs). If you do come here, just keep ordering the carnitas tacos and take in the unique interior design ;)
I had my doubts. No reason for any of them! Service was casual, and approachable.. The food is delivered quickly and the food runners are very nice too. . . I recommend that you ask your waiter questions, share with friends and order lots of different items from both kitchens. . . Excellent - fun place to go for a fancy-casual meal.
This place deserves more than the 3 stars it currently has at the time of this writing. I had both the Salt Air Margarita and the Singapore Sling. I don't normally like salted rims on my margaritas because I don't like the texture, but this salted foam was a nice, innovative way to infuse that flavor without the crunchiness. Perfect balance of sweet and citrus with enough punch. The Singapore Sling was also really well done, I could drink those all day. The lengua taco was small, but very soft and juicy.
