I've been here a few times now.  To be honest, I think it's a bit overrated.  I like pizza crust that's chewy.  Their crust is crispy and usually burnt on the edges.  The restaurant is also really small, so it's tough to get a table.
Pizza and salad were delicious!!!! Would have been 5 stars, but it got a little weird at the end. We happily waited for 2 hours for our table. Enjoyed a delicious meal. When the dessert menu came, we were discussing whether or not we wanted dessert and coffee or wine. The waitress told us that we were welcome so have dessert with wine, but we would need to move next door  if we wanted wine after our dessert. She said they needed that table. It was disappointing to wait that long for our table and not feel like we could enjoy our full meal. We would have given 2 or 3 stars at that point, but the house manager apologized. She bought our dessert and coffee while we sat next door. We were not rushed as we enjoyed our wine while listening to some fantastic live music. Without looking you would swear it was John Mayer. Thank you!
Love the buildling, love how you can watch your pizza being made. LOVED the atmosphere. Loud but in a good way, perfect evening out with friends. Parking kinda stinks, had to park in a parking garage and walk over but for sure worth the walk. Pizza is delicious!
It's the best pizza place in Phoenix, hands down. If you don't like the wait or think the crust is burnt or any other random complaint, go to Domino's on Central.  There's no pretense here.  Pretense means you're pretending.  These guys do not pretend to have the best pizza in the valley, they just do.
Over rated...crotchety owner...needs an attitude adjustment.  Friendliness is not an attribute.  The pizza was burned in a few places and the taste was okay - nothing to write home about (and yes...my home is New York).  The wit is not worth it - neither is the food or the tude.
If you want an Italian cheese crisp go here. If you want Pizza go anywhere else. NOT worth the wait.
I have been going to Pizza B's for years. It is a must stop for out of town guest who think they've had good pizza.  This place ALWAYS blows them away. . . The Wise Guy pizza is not to be missed.. . Great place, great food.
I love the slice of the day and the salad. I like the atmosphere and the convenient location.
We tried this place after it was voted a top 5 pizza place in the world on a show I watched. The pizza was indeed exceptional and I chose to wash it down w a Sunbru from Four Peaks. We tried the Margherita, Sonny Boy and the Wiseguy and the consensus favorite was the Sonny Boy. The salami and gaeta olives were a tremendous flavor combo and it was literally inhaled w only a few skid marks on the plate as evidence that it ever showed up. The other two pies were good as well but our table loved the Sonny. We went at mid-afternoon on a Thurs and it was nice to have no lines and we were in and out quickly. Well-earned 5 stars.
I'll give it 4 stars. It was our first time to Phoenix's "best pizza". The pizza is good. Especially the white pizzas.  Love the thin crispy crusts. We ordered 3 pizzas for 4 adults and 1 child. Had some leftovers. . The beer and wine list is extensive with plenty of good offerings. . The appetizers are good also. Cheese plate could hv been bigger but very tasty. The olive order was definitely very good and a good portion. . Unless you arrive early you'll have to wait depending on the size of your party. We waited 45min. . They really should build another oven in the bungalow next door versus sending people over there to wait.  They'd be just as busy but they'd get people in n out quickly. Thru hv the space to do it. But maybe they just want to stay a small operation. . My wife would go back but maybe not if the wait is over 30mins. I think you can get thin crispy artisan pizza from a lot of restaurants throughout the valley.  ie. parlor, Grimaldi's etc.
now that the new location is open and you can just walk in without a 2-3 hour wait, all is right in the world. you don't need me to tell you how fantastic the food is, but being able to pop in for lunch without blocking out your afternoon schedule is what puts it up to Perfect Status
Sat outside and enjoyed the nice breeze. Perfect pizza! The dough was amazing, sauce smooth, and the most delicious mozzerella cheese ever! My dad enjoyed his beer as well!
Atmosphere is nice, good for a romantic dinner. Got the sonny boy ($18) with a tasty mix of diced tomatoes, gaeta olives and salami.  The pizza sauce was good, not too sour or sweet, but couldn't stand up to the mozzarella which was very fresh.  The pizza dough was nice and crispy, but the edges were burnt (I don't think they expect you to eat the crust).  I saw that every other table was given a bread appetizer except us.  What gives?  Otherwise, the servers were attentive.  Sorry but for the price, I've had better.
Surprisingly I've been here three times and I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes. Not that I would mind waiting. The bar you can wait at next door is adorable! Perfect spot to grab a bottle or glass of wine before dinner. The restaurant itself is cozy, warm, and filled with delicious scents from the large oven. The margherita and the onion & pistachio pizzas are my favorites. The ingredients are fresh and delicious and the crust is perfection. The caprese salad is also great! I loved everything about my experience here.. Definitely plan to return again & again. Plan ahead and if possible go with a small party on a less crowded night during the week to avoid a reallyyy long wait.
Wanted to try this place because of lots of good reviews but was disappointed.  Food was subpar for price and our pizza was burnt.  I mentioned it to our waiter but was told that is how they are because they are cooked over the fire, I understood that but it's not normal for 1/4 of each piece to be charred black and taste burnt!  Overall was not pleased and won't be back!
I don't know why this place has all this hype. It's a very average pizza joint, absolutely nothing special. I found the pizza to be unbalanced in cheese and sauce. The flourless chocolate cake was ok, but nothing special. Average.
The pizza is great and the location is fun.  I would recommend trying to find a slower time as it is not worth a 2 hour wait, unless you have plenty of time to enjoy the bar next door for a glass of wine or beer.  Having said that, the pizza really is very good.
I am giving four stars for their great customer service and kind accommodation.  As we were nearing to Phoenix, I called at 8:58PM (2 minutes before closing) to see whether they would seat us.  She (Erin?) asked us where we were, and I said 5-10minutes.... When we arrived at the restaurant at 9:10PM, they gladly let us put in an order (although the CLOSE sign was shown).  As a former waiter, I was surprised to have been able to place an order after the closing. . . Needless to say, we devoured the pizzas in the car, on our way to my friend's house.
It must be as good as it gets - I've never been able to get in the place and after getting blind drunk at their wine bar twice while waiting I gave up trying.. . Been to some of Signor Bianco's other places though - as they say in NYC, I'd go back ...
First off I must say I have been wanting to try this place for years. I have heard that it is the best pizza in the country! Has been on a few tv shows and is on everybodies must eat list. As I happen to be in the Phoenix area I set out to finally give this place a try. Warned that there maybe an hr or two wait I was determined to have the best pizza in the country. Get there around noon on a beautiful Saturday day. No line, walked right in. Great start. Order some drinks and a few pizzas. Prices seemed kinda steep but for the best pizza in the world I would pay double. My party of 3 and I are very excited about this pizza until it arrives at our table. Both pizza are kinda small and look very basic. Everyone at the table are looking around at each other like what the hell is this? Don't worry, it must taste unbelievable right? Wrong! There is nothing special about this pizza. It didn't taste bad. It just didn't taste good. You can tell they use fresh ingredients but so do I at home. If this place is considered a pizza mecca than maybe I should open a pizza restaurant because I make a far better pizza than this. . . Very disappointed by this place. It was like meeting my hero and was disappointed he was just a normal guy. I so wanted to like this place as this place is a legend in the pizza world. A $90 bill later and I would have rather had pizza hut says a lot. Just left and already thinking about where to eat next as I am still hungry. Dont believe the hype. You have been warned.
Best pizza in America?  It was good but definitely not the best.  Worth trying if there is no wait.
Fantastic! I will be back!
Best pizza I've had since living in the greater Phoenix area, hands down! Pizzeria Bianco is located in a quaint historic area of downtown Phoenix surrounded by several other turn of the century homes that have since been turned into little restaurants and bars. We went here after hearing some good reviews for lunch this past Saturday. We got here around 3ish so we were able to get a table right away on their front patio in the shade, but things fill up pretty quickly and I've heard its fairly typical to wait an hour for a table. We split a salad and had the margarita pizza with added fennel sausage. Everything is very simple but is done with very high quality ingredients that gives the food a very unique and delicious flavor! We will for sure be back!
The gold standard of fresh Italian. The pizza, the bread, the salads are all incredible! Prepare to wait 2-3 hours for a table.
Pizzeria Bianco definitely lives up to their hype.. . Yes, the wait to eat there is VERY long, but I thought it was worth it, especially when you have great company. I've only gotten their white pizzas there but I have loved them both. The last time I went there, I got the Sonny Boy and it was really good. I've never seen pistachios on a pizza and was a little hesitant, but it turned out to be delicious! The crust on these pizzas is probably the best I've had anywhere and I love to try out pizza places. It is the perfect combination of crunchy, crispy, and chewy. . . We also got a salad (which comes with their bread) and it was a great, light way to start. It wasn't anything special, but we were starving so the bread definitely helped fill out stomachs up a little bit and made us happy campers after the long wait. :). . Whenever people visit, I always take them here and Camelback mountain because I feel like these two are staples of Arizona.
love this place! the only bad part is the LONG wait! BUT you can always count on some music under the stars drinking moscato while you wait to be seated! (:
The pizza here is as good as it is in most fire pizza oven places I've been to in L.A.  I know most consider it the best in the country or the best in the world, and maybe it so for some reason, which is great but it only means that some people don't travel outside of Phoenix as often as they should.  Once again, the food was a solid good food so there is no issue there.  My only issue is the claim that it is the "best" - that I don't get. OK OK if I have to be super picky, I can also add that the cheese was on the stingy side = large patches of exposed tomato sauce were evident throughout the pie.. . and the parking, hmm the parking - sucks.  Small parking lot, Valet only (which I don't like at all) + $3.00 for the "pleasure" - really? really?
I've been twice.  Both times I ordered the traditional Margherita and was not disappointed.  Additionally I enjoyed the wine by the glass.  The first time I went was in the middle of the week after 8PM and there was no wait.  The next time my husband and I made a reservation and sat outside- fabulous ambiance.  I am only giving four stars because I feel like this place was so "hyped" up before I went I was expecting something mind-blowing.  It is great quality food, great wine selection, great atmosphere - but nothing out of the ordinary for traditional wood-fired Italian style pizza.
