So have been here when they first opened as a ghetto joint and now with all the nice remodeling . The food is still good (u might get a heart attack or cavity w the sugar in their kool-aid) but one thing that hasn't changed is the service is still as slow as dang molasses. . I have a toddler now and the long wait to get service, drinks, and our food was not sitting well with her or me. 40 min wait to get seated, 10 min for a waiter to appear, close to an hour for food and waiter to reappear. . I think if you're looking for a place to go hang with adults to catch up; the wait is worth the wait. . . Dress code: ghetto to fab to ghetto fab is all gravy in here.
Fantastic fried chicken, super delicious grits with cheese an butter, and great okra served by an attentive and friendly staff.. A great place to eat.. Only thing I missed was a craft beer with my delicious meal.. Oh, NSC and cheese great too.
Dear Larry this is david ristick we had my sons 16th birthday day party I love your restaurant your food your service is always five stars !!! we love your whole family we've been friends for years I was there since you open the restaurant Your new GM Maurice made us feel so unwelcome so miserable that it made me feel like I would never want to come there again you know that I drove all away from LA to make my son's birthday party special and  he made us feel so bad that I never want to come back there again if he is working He should be fired!! With all due respect to you your family and your establishment God bless you Larry keep keeping the food coming out good just get rid of this guy ASAP he will ruin your restaurant! He actually said when I told him that I drove from LA  and that I drove 400 miles And he said i "quote I don't care if you drove 4000 miles! "What a loser!
Was there for lunch this afternoon it was amazing  super friendly super fast  excellent food  couldn't have had a  better time A+++
If you have been to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in LA. Well welcome to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles in Phoenix. The chicken is off the chain,waffles are yummy. The family ate small bowls of Mac and cheese and rice over red beans and cheese grits. It was all good. Can't wait to come back forsome more chicken and I want get my hands on some shrimp and grits
Come early... or be prepared to wait... Which I had ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH! It was early spring in Phoenix, so waiting outside wasn't a big deal at all. One thing that would have made this experience extra ordinary is if they had a bartender or a server working the people waiting outside. We could have got a jar of DRANK before we actually walked in and sat down and our appetites would have REALLY been right. . I ordered the fried chicken, fries, and mac and cheese. I must say I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of food. You can tell they serve hundreds of people on a daily basis and their level of consistency of their food was exceptional. . Moreover, our server, I believe his name was Aaron (I apologize if I am incorrect) service was the cream of the crop. He took care of our table, he was fun, he was exciting, he joked with us, all things that make the experience that much better. . I will be back in Phoenix within the next month, you better believe that I will be here as soon as I land! Its not that far from the airport, I am sure I will be able to smell the aroma of the fried chicken as soon as I land. . Damn son, you all need to get a location in Denver, PHO REAL!
When you're talking chicken & waffle places, no matter what, it'll always have to stack up against Roscoe's. It may not be fair, but that's how it's gotta be. I've also been to chicken & waffle places up and down the west coast, so I know what I'm talking about here. In the end, nothing quite stacks up to the OG, Roscoe.. . Still, doesn't mean that Lo-Lo can't throw in a contender. And quite a contender it is. His sendup of the classic most definitely works for me. Fluffy waffle, and tender fried chicken doused in Louisiana-style hot sauce. That's what I'm talking about. Can't forget the mac & cheese either, which was a very healthy portion. . . The food is good, but what won me over? Lemonade. Unlike Roscoe's, Lo-Lo's will refill your lemonade. Can't go wrong with that. Service was fantastic, and even with a half-hour wait on a Friday night, everyone was still pleasant and happy. Just wish I wasn't so full to try that red velvet cake.. . No one will ever step to Roscoe, but Lo-Lo and Sandra Dee in Sacramento are more than qualified contenders to the title.
Love Lo-Lo's! The chicken and waffle combo is delicious. The mac and cheese is just average to me- nothing extraordinary about it and not worth $4. I like the kool-aid and the sweet tea- both very sweet and cavity inducing. The waffles have an awesome buttery taste and the chicken is perfectly fried. Took off a star because parking is horrible and there is always a long wait to be seated.
I'm a huge fan of Mrs. Whites, and this is a chip off the ol' block, but with a twist. The fried chicken is tender and juicy inside while perfectly crispy on the outside. Great flavor as well, and not dripping with grease. The green beans are perfection! Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and had a slight kick (heat) to them. The mac and cheese was also delicious. The corn bread muffin was moist, buttery and flavorful. I was so full, but had to try thered velvet, and so glad I did. The cake is so moist and the frosting is perfect; not overly sweet. The only thing to be aware of is that bits of the red cake get stuck between teeth. Looks like those red pills you use to check if you're brushing your teeth correctly (epic fail). I'm just glad I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and noticed my red teeth before heading out to the next event. So,note to self,  don't take pictures after eating the cake and be cautious if you're on a first date. If he or she is giggling while looking at you, it's not because you're funny (well, your are, but not for the reasons you think). Service was alright, considering how busy it was. . . The HUGE negative is that I came on a Saturday and the ENTIRE parking lot (mind you it's really small) is valet. So, you're paying additional money to eat here on the weekend. You could choose to park along the street or in front of someone's home, but  I'm not sure how safe the area is. It's so busy on the weekend parking is limited. We got there around 10:30am and parked  close by and waited about 15 minutes for a table. There's a very small waiting area inside. Most people had to wait outside, which was fine since the weather is nice. But in the summer and winter, this could be an issue. Was it worth it?  Ohhhh, yeah!
Not worth the 2 1/2 + hours it took to get served our food.. Nothing special about the fried chicken that stands out as a must try. Waffles a waffle, can't mess that up. . After an hour and 15 minute wait, ask the host if they planned on sitting us and he replied "you can't walk in at 8 o'clock and expect to be seated right away". Not the answer to give when hosting. Oh, we walked in at 7, was told a 45 minute wait which ended up being an hour an 1/2. . Overall, the rave about this place is beyond me. Slow service, poor host, average food.
Love this place! i have been to Scottsdale location as well and both have surpassed my expectations . Pretty big portions and large beverages! will definitely be back
Way too much food and more than a little unhealthy.  Greasy salty chicken, drinks were too sugary ... And yet all part of an experience you need to visit while in Phoenix.  BTW one order can feed 2 people easy.  DJ and atmosphere made it authentic.
Waffles are yummy, chicken is juicy, service is on point. It was loud, but I liked it. I'm a loud person, the atmosphere made it easy to be myself. I'll be back.
