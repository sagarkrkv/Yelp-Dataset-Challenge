Ill make this quick ---. . Easy check in-fast. They get you right in and into your room. Hooked us up fast with our MLife Card (for comps). Ate at BLT Burger - very tasty and not bad prices. Best sportsbook in LV. Huge screens and lots of them. . Drink service was very good for a casino. Play and you get good drink service. Saw Ray Romano at the Fator Theater. Hilarious and worth the money.. Room was great. Bed was so comfy. Didn't want to get up.. Gambled enough to get comped several meals - easy to deal with . . Just a good casino in the middle of the strip. Great location to walk to other places quickly. Cant go wrong with the Mirage.
I would say Yelp was right on with the amount of stars that The Mirage should have.  I would have given it 3 and half stars too.  It is not a super luxurious hotel but it is far from being considered a roach motel.  . . I went with The Mirage for a weekend getaway Vegas trip for my boyfriend's birthday because of its location.  The Mirage was a good choice just because the rooms are clean, spacious and modern.  Note: The room was great, I will get to the bathroom later.  It was also very conveniently located, right between Treasure Island, which I also have stayed at before.  I would choose Mirage over Treasure Island.  Treasure Island rooms are small and their wifi sucks.  It is also located next to Caesars Palace and across the street from Harrahs, Imperial Palace, Venetian/Palazzo and a short walk away from Encore/Wynn.  . . Parking was fine, as with most Vegas hotels they had their own lot.  They had both a self park and valet option.  Check in was easy too, we had a little problem finding the guest elevators.  Those were a little confusing.. . I did not get the chance to see the dolphin habitat.  To tell you the truth I did not spend much time inside The Mirage casino.  Nothing about it really stands out, so the only time my boyfriend and I were in the casino area was because we were usually leaving the casino to go somewhere else.  To me, there really did not seem like there was a lot to do.  It was not the most aesthetically pleasing hotel, by that I mean they did not have canals like The Venetian, the whole Parisian streets thing like Paris or the Miracle Mile like Planet Hollywood, they had a volcano that was outside and the Dolphin habitat.  . . The rooms are a good value for what you pay.  They are roomy and modern looking.  They had a nice multimedia center that had a desk, a wall mounted flat screen television with good channels and a snack bar/mini fridge.  The bed is fairly comfy, no complaints there and it was clean with no odd stains or anything like that.  See attached pictures of the room.  . . Forewarning: The mini fridge and snack bar have sensors on them so if you remove anything they will charge you.  That means you cannot take things out of the fridge to put your things in there and then put the stuff back afterwards.  They will charge you if you take things from the fridge even if you do not eat it.  . . I think the one thing that needed renovating in the room was the bathrooms.  The condition of the bathrooms really did not match how nice and modern looking the room was.  The bathroom looked like it had not been touched up/remodeled since the 90's.  Very small, horrible lighting, white tub, shower curtain, white toilet, the usual hairdryer given, it was just not appealing to the eye at all.  . . Despite that though, I would stay at The Mirage again.  The rooms are nice and the location is very convenient and no one was throwing wild parties in their room and disrupting my sleep.  Although according to many, it is not a proper Vegas trip if you are sleeping through most of it.
We've stayed at The Mirage twice in the last two years and we absolutely love this hotel.. . I've spent many hours researching great places to stay in Las Vegas, and this one strikes me as one of the best "bang for your buck" places on the strip. It has clean rooms, super comfortable beds, nice decor, and IMO it's located on the best part of the Strip (Caesar's, TI, Paris, and Bellagio are all nearby).. . The Mirage Volcano is my second favorite free show (behind Bellagio Fountains) and the Beatles LOVE show is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. The buffet is also one of the best in town.. . All around, this hotel is awesome for the price. You can also score some great deals if you google it.
Although me and my girl were only here for literally 24 hours for the Canelo v Angulo fight this weekend, I couldn't have been happier with my decision to stay at the Mirage.  We had the king suite on the 25th floor.  Very nice room.  I was glad i paid that extra money to cancel my reservation at the ballys and get this one.  This is my mom's favorite vegas hotel and casino and it's been around a while now in comparison to some of the newer and hipper joints, but it holds its own all these years later.  I recommend it to anyone whose going to vegas.  I don't go too often to Vegas, only fourth time in 8 years...but if you see that the rooms at the Cosmo, Aria, Wynn, Bellagio, Venetian are much pricier, definitley book yourself this room and save the extra dough for gambling, drinks, clubs, buffets!
I highly recommend visiting the Spa & Fitness Center. There is a package offered where you get a training session AND a massage. Derris was my trainer and he was very educated and we did some really awesome strength training; and having a trainer here in SD, I feel that I am familiar with a lot of techniques and versions. He was solid, provided me with a great work out and educated me on a few methods to try here at home in the gym. Patrick was my masseuse and he was also a good guy, who did a really good job with a deep tissue. I left feeling stronger and relaxed all in a few hours.  If you're looking to doll it up, I would recommend visiting Lisa in the Spa. She did all of our make up one evening and she's not only a doll, but she did such an awesome job. We all felt so beautiful for our night out on the town.  Mirage may be an older resort, but the employees I had encounters with during my stay were 5 star in my book.
If this review was based solely on the hotel room, it would have easily been four stars. However I'm basing this review on our experience as a whole in The Mirage.. . The Room:. . I thought it was close to perfect! The decor was next level and had a nice vibe. A friend who was also staying here did point out there were no bath robes in the room but I didn't find that to be a major problem. I've attached photos of the room.. . I've stayed at The MGM, The Vidara, Planet Hollywood and The Monte Carlo .. hands down this hotel had the best room. . . I have a problem finding a shower with good water pressure but i have to say, the shower in The Mirage has great pressure - it's just a shame the shower head was the size of a quarter. Also, room service actually understood that a privacy sign on the door handle meant do not disturb, from experience, a concept most hotels fail to grasp!. . The Hotel:. . When we made the booking we were given a $50 credit to spend in the hotel, however when we check in there was no mention of it. We went back to the lobby to ask about it because we forgot when we checked in and we did in fact have $50 to spend, but i was a little bit mad that we weren't told that on arrival. . . I did a review for The Monte Carlo a couple of weeks ago. On check in there we were given a $75 credit to spend, $75 which paid for multiple meals for me and my wife. On the other hand, the restaurants in The Mirage are WAY over priced. Embarrassingly overpriced. There are close to 10 restaurants in the hotel and not one was realistic. There was even a California Pizza Kitchen which charged a minimum of $20 for a pizza. The line for a table was huge! Probably because this was the cheapest restaurant available. . . There was only one place which served breakfast and it cost $15 for eggs and bacon. Maybe i'm more 'frugal' let's say, than most but 3 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon for $15 . + Tax and Tip .. Come on! . . We also ate at 'FIN' i think it was called, an asian restaurant. I had a cup of soup which was $10 and i stress that it was a cup, not a bowl. Entrees were all around $30 and all were 'A La Carte' .. In other words, you have to pay $15 for fried rice or chow mein. The soup was amazing to be fair, but the main meal was a let down and left me hungry.. . All in all, the hotel itself is great, as are the rooms. If you plan on eating outside of the hotel the entire time, i'd say give it a shot.
The staff here were extremely nice! They front desk allowed is to check in at 11am when check in is usually 1-3 pm depending what hotel it is and how generous they are.. Called the front desk a couple of times for general information and they were glad to help out! Very cheerful attitudes.. House keeping left our room spectacular each morning!. Had a great experience here and will definitely return to this hotel next time I'm in town, which will probably be next week!. . P.s.. The gambling machines were very lucky!
Must see the Boys II Men show! Beautiful hotel! Great nightclubs and nice restaurants. Would recommend checking out the hotel if you are in Vegas.
4 1/2 stars! Our prior stay in Vegas was at the Luxor (nice place but waaaaaaay too far out on the start of the strip) so for our two night couples trip to Las Vegas for 03/14 weekend we chose The Mirage and loved this place. Stayed in a regular king sized room and it was the perfect size, very clean and nicely decorated. I'm sure you can find a fancier room in other hotels but this is a great place at a very decent price, plus great location on the strip. The entire hotel is very pretty. Lots of plants and flowers. The general pool area is huge and relaxing (seperate from Bare pool party area). Volcano show is cool and buffett was pricey but food was good. Didnt eat at any of the restaurants there but there's definitely options to choose from.. There was an incident as we were checking-in where another guest was making a huge scene and getting angry with the staff (his problem had nothing to do with the hotel but with the cab driver who drove him there)... anyway, the young lady who was assisting us was not only very nice before the incident but apologized several times afterwards and gave each of our rooms (3 rooms) a $25 credit because we had to witness the uncomfortable moment. Not much but I thought it was nice of her because it wasnt something she HAD to do. I will definitely be back to the Mirage!
Cheap, comfortable and near everything. It was also very quiet. I have no complaints. It's not a five star hotel, but still great. . . The dolphin exhibit was $20, which is a bit high when you can see an entire zoo for that much. My friends and I had to pass.
First time in Vegas - I liked this hotel - it was pretty big but easy to navigate. There were restaurants in there but it's definitely worth venturing out as this isn't the be all end all. Biggest gripe with the Mirage, WiFi is TERRIBLE. I was there for work and found it almost impossible to do anything, which was extremely frustrating. But overall the stay itself is nice for what it is.
A moth the size of a hummingbird in my room. A glop of dried, yellow-white ummm...   substance, with black hairs stuck to it, on my pillow. Perhaps worst of all, NO COFFEE MACHINE IN THE ROOM! (And a 1/2 hour wait for coffee in the only cafe downstairs.) Really not a good time. Never again.
This place was the joint back in a 2009 trip to Vegas. Stayed here one night but it was such a fun atmosphere. It is now still generating attention but one of the definite older casinos. I was here last year in June 2013, just to go to 1oak nightclub. Sean Paul the reggae artist performed that night and did put on a good show.  The Volcano is the main attraction here. It is set in a lagoon with palm trees and waterfalls.  The volcano does erupt and smoke and fire extend 100 feet into the sky. Every hour on the hour you get to are the show.  It is usually always a crowd in the streets and across the street to see. I recommend you see this once if you just happen to be right there of course.
I stayed at the Mirage for a friend's birthday. We really only used the room as a place to crash after celebrating at the clubs, but WOW. What a room it was! Modern, elegant with huge beds and a flat screen tv !! There was a tonnn of walking space in the room, which made the space seem really open. I was disappointed about the bathroom though. With all the space it had, they couldn't have made the bathroom a bit bigger?! . . In the casino, the Mirage is super organized and spacious. But, it is always worth it to visit 1Oak and Revolution. 1Oak is more a club, and Rev is a small lounge/bar area.. . It's always worth it to stay at any hotel for 1 or 2 nights, and this one had a bigger room out of most that I've stayed at..but I feel like you can definitely find a hotel that has more interesting things inside the hotel itself. . . People do like to walk from the Mirage to other casinos, though! I suggest that every hotel have a vending machine for fold-up flats, after girls die in their heels :)
In town for 1 night for work. Room was a great rate, and very nice. Bed sucked though. Unfortunately learned this the hard way after a night of sleeping in a heavily dented bed. The crappy sleep ruined my experience.. . The hotel itself has really awesome offerings, eateries, and watering holes. Service is friendly.
Just spent 2 nights at the Mirage. Overall it was a great stay. I thought the room was nice and clean. The bathroom was nice, but small and it looks like they've redone the sink area, but completely left out the bathtub. The bathtub may be the original, it really needed some help! My other complaint would be that the walls are extremely thin. It wasn't an issue most of the time, but anytime people were walking in the hallway it sounded like they stopped, came in our room and continued their conversation. We had a strip view on the 22nd floor and it was great. We had a great view of the volcano and Venetian. The volcano is not to be missed! We never used the pool area, but we did walk out and see it. It's beautiful and if the weathers right I would highly recommend making time to spend out there. I love that they have many restaurants open late. I stayed at the Luxor and Caesar palace prior and if you're hungry after 11pm you're out of luck. We had a package that included tickets to Love. It was great! We had nose bleed seats, but honestly I think it was better to sit at the top and be able to see everything that was going on. Great stay, would definitely stay here again.
