We went for happy hour on a Friday night.  It was really busy and we sat outside until a table was available. Which was fine.  It is a really nice patio area.  The ambiance is nice as well.  The restaurant has it;s finer points, however it is way over priced for the food you get.  I had flat bread and baked goat cheese.  Neither were bad, they just were not great either.   Our tab was almost $70 for 4 drinks and two appetizers.   The service was really slow.  When we were finished and the waitress brought our check, the bus boy came around and started taking everything from the table, including what was left of my wine I was still finishing. Granted there was not much left in the glass to speak of and I wasn't paying attention when he came around.   But hello, we are still sitting here.  You bus the table when people leave, not while they are finishing up.  I understand removing dinner plates and things of that nature, but they were removing everything on the table. I just find that rude.   Anyhow, I would go back for drinks, but not for food.  There are much better places to eat in town for the price then this place.  .
We've been to St Francis plenty of times but figured it was finally due time to review. We had a wonderful waiter, Andrew, who took care of us from the get-go for our Sunday brunch visit in late January. Friendly, helpful, and had no problem confirming that the guy next to our table was the teacher from Glee. Eeeeeeeeeee.....status update! With Spring Training in town, the weather and people watching is perfect for hitting St Francis for a pre-Renaissance Faire or baseball game brunch.
St. Francis is a really cool spot with good drinks and a GREAT happy hour. I've been a few times now, the salmon is always perfectly cooked and I love the cucumber cooler. Sad to see one of the servers that served me prviously isn't there anymore - she was great and very helpful when we had to wait for a table for over an hour. Miss you Erykah Badu !! overall great experiences every time, the food takes a little while to get out of the kitchen but it's usually worth it
I have never had such a good lunch with my children! Their food was FREE! I can't believe how big the burger and fries were for them. They loved it!! Every time I am here the service is awesome. They make us feel at home, and they have a great attitude about us having the children with us:) once my chicken was too dry:( but not always! . The salads are amazing and happy hour is perfect!!! We will be back a lot!!!
I went here based on the reviews and menu and my experience confirmed the high praise - and then some!  They are a very conscience restaurant - for example, the server knew where the salmon was caught, which farms the chicken comes from, and where the produce is from.  Everything was prepared with care and it is evident with every flavorful bite.  It was great eating a meal that was as healthful as it was flavorful.  You won't regret eating here!
I will come back to this place - but when it is warmer. . We went there in early March 2014, on a cooler AZ night. even though we had a reservation they wanted to seat us upstairs where it is a bit lonely and the ambiance is missing, and it was colder than downstairs. We asked for a table downstairs and were seated right next to the OPEN door to the patio. on top of it there was a fan blowing above our heads, all of that at a felt 60 Degrees inside. Not sure why they need a fan in the AZ winter and why they need TWO large open doors to the patio. Everyone around us was freezing, and putting their jackets on and finally someone of the restaurante rediuced the fan speed (which helped a bit).. . Oh yes and they forgot to bring our appetizer before our main dish too, so service was ok - not great. . . Having said that, the food was very good, and innovative. . the patio looks great and cosy so I will return when it is warmer outside. if they seat me outside - GREAT - if they seat me inside, I am ok with that too and actually might want the open door and the fan. . . so 4 stars for the food. 2 stars for the temperature . 3 for service
Great food, nice atmosphere. There are a lot of nice original libations (try the Ruby Red, if you like vodka) and the burgers are really tasty. The Chile Verde is really nice, too. Because the bar opens to the outside, it's a treat sitting there -- whether you're on the inside looking out, or on the outside catching a breeze. If you have out-of-towners and want to take them somewhere fun, I'd recommend this place.
Pot Roast with Polenta Delicious but overpriced. Moroccan meat balls did not suit my wife's tastes, but I thought they were good (albeit reheated the next day at home.) Good service on a wobbly table and uncomfortable chairs.. Fun setting.
Let me say that I only had cocktails this time but food in the past has ALWAYS been outstanding. Tonight I had such great service & wonderful wine. Always enjoy this cool neighborhood eatery.
Try everything
I adore this place!. . They have great atmosphere and delicious food. However, I am specifically in love with their happy hour. I'm on a tight budget and it is sooo nice to be able to get amazing cocktails (try the cider sidecar) for so cheap! Plus, the fingerling potatoes are to die for.. . And! My waiter was exceptionally nice and kept coming out to check on us even though we were the only ones on the patio. Great service!
We Went here for my boyfriends dinner.  It was a quiet wednesday night.  He arrived first (i wanted to look extra nice so of course I was a few minutes late)  I appreciated that they sat him and didn't make him wait for me.  I also appreciated that he had a beer in hand by the time I got there.  That means the service was pretty snappy.  . . The hostess was sweet and sent me to the right table and etc.  The valet was even exceptionally friendly.  . . We had Monique as our server.  She was very pleasant.  She had a nice personality but gave us our space as well.   My drink was snappy and she seemed to always be close but not be hovering.  . . Chris had the fish.  The presentation was beautiful, the portion looked small but he said it was very rich and filled him up.  I had the meatballs.  Again it looked small but I was surprised that I couldn't finish and took some home.  My food was excellent and Chris was very happy with his as well.  Bill came out to a bit more that most restaurants but for a special occasion it was well worth it.
Yeah, came here for a drink with a buddy and got total shit customer service from the bartender. Always disappointing when a spot so close to home has horrible service. I won't be returning and if you prefer a minimum of a smile with you over priced food and drinks go somewhere else besides St. Francis because you may not even get that much there.
I have only been here twice and i am in love! I'm not sure how the menus work or if they change? But when i have gone both times i loved each meal!! super good quality food taste and A+ for customer service and atmosphere! very "central"! (:
We heard so much about this from friends who visited here.  We thought we would give it a try.. . food wasn't bad.  The pizza was divine.  We went at an odd time,( 3:00PM) so if was a bit empty but filed up quickly for happy hour..  . The happy hour prices are pretty good.  We had the meatballs, salad, and fingerling potatoes.  Everything was great.  Our only gripe?  Another restaurant with the complimentary Valet parking.  Why?  Can't I park my own car?  I am that irresponsible?  It was good food and a great atmosphere.  We'll be back.
St Francis is hit and miss. Mid day - they just don't get customer service - they want to tell you all about their issues, we are changing shifts, the kitchen is changing over etc... . Burger was average.. Come on St Francis you are better than this.. Step up.
Picture a Monday afternoon, the sun shining but it's still perfectly comfortable weather outside, and you have nothing you need to do. No, that's not a scene from a movie, I just got lucky while on vacation in Phoenix and had a taste of life after retiring. If I were to retire tomorrow, you bet I'd keep coming back to St. Francis for happy hour!. . Anyway, we sat in the covered patio area and had some drinks and snacks. The Dark&Stormy (cool name) and Santa Rosa were great drinks; I had more than a few of the Santa Rosa. For eats, the Baked Goat Cheese and House Baguette were a perfect combination.. . It was nice, refreshing and relaxing.
