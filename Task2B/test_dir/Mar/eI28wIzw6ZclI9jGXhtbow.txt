One of the best performances I've ever seen.  Mix of raunchy humor, showmanship, and down right entertainment!  Not for the easily offended.
It's  shows like these that make me feel ooh so patriotic.. . Do you like watching crazy stunts?  Do you like barely clad beautiful bodies?. . Picture it.. A beautiful glistening body . Muscles tense. Ooh my.... Did he actually just do that?. Ooh my.... Now he's taking off clothes!. . Yes, there are lovely lady athletes too for all you guys.. . Combine this with hilarious X-rated humor and an intimate venue that makes you feel up close and oh so personal.... . Side splitting guilty giggles.. Jaw dropping acrobatics.. Sexy bodies in your face.. . . This is what America is all about.  At least on vacation.
Bravo...  A new fresh show on the Strip. A must see.  Best show I have seen in Veas in a while.  Seats are a little tight but the entertainment is fantastic!   A true variety show.
This show is profane, silly, and a TON of fun. I laughed the entire time, something I have never done before. The husband and wife MC's work well together, and are a total crack up. There are decent circus acts, but most of them, you have seen before, or are common. They only add to the fun as the MC's are saying ridiculous and vulgar things throughout the show.. . **Spoiler Alert** They engage the audience a lot, including getting two member of the audience - strangers - to actually touch tongues!!. . This is a terrific, unique, and very funny show.
Absinthe is not just for drinking.. . Located in a huge tent outside Caesar's Palace on the Vegas Strip you'll find this show hosted by the Gazillionaire and his sidekick Penny.  Both are completely raunchy, politically incorrect in every way, and very, VERY funny.  . . However, this is a variety show.  You'll see ribbon acrobatics, roller skating duos, strongmen and a magician.  Oh yes, and fornicating sock puppets steal the show.  I guarantee you will never play sock monster again without recalling this X-rated version.. . Audience participation?  Lol - more like audience degradation, so be careful about your seat choice.  In our show there was an older couple...  60-65ish dressed pretty formally.  They were dubbed "The Republicans" and although Mr. was clearly having a blast at his own expense (so were we), Mrs. clearly was NOT.  And she walked out mid-show, leaving Mr. alone with the rest of their party...- he stayed, but didn't laugh nearly as much.  There were many other cultural stereotypes held equally in the crosshairs, but only after "a show of hands for___" was asked by the Gazillionaire.  You may want to keep your hands at your sides, unless you're fortified by your friends, sense of humor AND a couple of drinks!. . The tent is huge, but as a Vegas venue it's small. In circus fashion, the seats are folding chairs and you will touch the person beside you.  It's not a long show, so manage you biological needs before show-time.
Save your money.  The worst show in Vegas.  If eighth grade, gross, insulting humor is your idea of funny, then this is for you.  My wife and I walked out on this show (the first time we've EVER done that), and they refused to refund our money!. . Now here's the thing: we're not prudish at all, in fact we're very liberal and, quite frankly, I use the "F" word myself. But when the jokes are simply in poor taste and they beat you over the head with them going on about gross descriptions the harry parts of a man's area and the things to do there, well, wow - seriously?  And that's supposed to be funny?  Not to half the audience.. . During the first quarter of the show not many people laughed, instead, they turned to look at their neighbor to see if what was happening was actually happening and if they should be offended or laugh at it.  Not many did.  All the conservatives (republicans) and many of the minority people there were attacked and offended right away, so not many people were laughing.  After a while, the alcohol kicked in and the eight graders arrived and half the people nervously laughed. . . Here is when we left:  During the set up of one of their circus acts, they searched the audience for an "Asian woman" and dragged her on stage.  Then they picked an over weight, obviously drunk guy, and a black guy and they were going to have them strip and lap dance to the poor woman.  OMG.  We were out of there.  . . Bottom line: Very expensive for an out door instant tent, not funny nor entertaining in the least, vulgar and offensive, a complete waste of money and an evening.  My wife was infuriated and I was aghast that any moron would find this funny.  I just felt bad for the people who have to be in the show.  . . Again, save your money and go see any one of the many better shows for 1/2 the price.  A disgrace.
Worst show ever!. . It's the most gross, childish, low class degrading show I've ever seen in Vegas.. . I paid good money for it but had to walk out during the show. What? Making rude jokes on private body parts so bluntly, and making fun on all the colored people doesn't entertain me. And tasteless jokes on anyone who's liberal or conservative, anyone would find this show shocking. I know it's an equal discrimination, but I wouldn't pay a penny for it. . . If you're looking for a sexy show, this is not it. It's not a topless show. And it's a lot more expensive than most if not all of the adult shows in Vegas. And the show is performed in a circus "tent" rather than an actual theater. It's amazing that they charge so much. There were some nice parts in the show, that's the nice acrobatic performances, but half of the time, it's filled with insulting humors that make me frown with shock. I'm a liberal person by heart but don't find rude jokes on gays and minorities funny or entertaining.. . I'm surprised that Caesar Palace, who hosts reputable shows like Celine Dion, Elton John, Shania Twain and Rod Stewart, would host such a degrading and senseless show like Absinthe. If you're wondering if you should go to this show, DON'T!  Save your money instead and use it on the many other good shows in Vegas like Love, Zumanity, etc. As for the other 4 and 5 star reviews?  Obviously cast members posting shameless promotional reviews.  . . Simply disgraceful.
Boy oh boy! This is definitely one of the shows that should have a big poster board in bright neon and bold letters in the box office entrance that states: . . "IF YOU ARE EASILY OFFENDED, TURN AROUND AND GO WATCH A FREAKING MUSICAL!" . . This production is definitely one of the few shows that holds nothing back, literally. If you are a white or black, skinny or overweight, liberal or conservative, they will touch upon anything and exploit to the nth degree. It pulls no punches and instead it actually tries to delivers a knockout shot each and every time. Most people leave after the minute in the first round. Clearly stated, if you are easily offended, this is the worst show you will have ever seen... if you can handle taking a few jokes, it might still be the worst show you have ever seen. Simply put, you have to BE the worst person in the world for the 1.5 hour show to truly enjoy it. Based on the crowd reaction as well as amount of people that still flock to Absinthe, many of us are absolutely cruel people. (Har har Har) . . . All in all, for myself, I couldn't stop laughing in this show. It's just bad for all the right reasons. The Gazillionaire pretty much opens up the show with a blitzkrieg with enough ammunition to lay waste to everyone in the tent. No holds barred and you can see the audience tensing up as they have no idea what's in stored for his verbal barrage soon to come. . . Penny the trusty a filthy mouthed sidekick is just as crude if not more... she has her "monologue" (if that's what you want to call it) and I can't tell you the kind of faces I've seen in the audience who were NOT laughing. About 90 percent of us were almost going to have our stomaches collapse on us but the other 10 percent were in face palm mode. Great stuff though. . . Oh wait... Did I forget to mention it was a VARIETY SHOW? . . Absinthe is built around the tasteless and profane comedy but in it's entirety is reminiscent of a 50's traveling circus act. From acrobats, trapeze,  tight rope walking, bizarro acts etc. .. they provide a little  bit of everything to amaze audiences in a small confined space. There is a little bit of singing and dancing but nothing to divert the act from anything less than a circus show. The performers that night were all on point. Didn't see any major mess-ups and all of them put on a great show. My favorite were the roller skaters... it was exhilarating since they were performing pretty risky maneuvers on such a small platform right in front of the audience. The Gazillionaire did a great job introducing and selling the show to the audience all the while still making us laugh. . . . To finish up this review, I really do believe this is probably the top 2-3 shows in town. As long as you have an open mind and is willingly ready to enjoy the debauchery it's just a great time. Totally would recommend it to adults and maybe some older folks. Definitely leave the kids at home.. it's 18 up but even 18 year old kids should wait on this one. I'm 24 and I've been corrupted by 'Penny's Puppets" Hahahaha
Went for my birthday and loved it! Was cracking up the entire time, but I have a pretty liberal (childish?) sense of humor. As said by others, definitely not for uppity types or anyone offended by over-the-top racial and sexual humor. Glad I was not sitting toward the front though, because I also embarrass easily and would not have wanted to be picked on. TIP: if you're shy, you might want to ask to opt out of the first 3 or 4 rows. They will harass you and even pulled people up for a lap dance competition!. . Aside from the humor, the circus acts were breathtaking. Being in such a small venue made it feel intimate and dangerous. The performers were just as, if not more talented than anyone you'll see in a big name circus, and here they're performing a few feet above your head. And with most being scantily clad, it was two shows in one :). . My only complaint is that we had a somewhat obstructed view. You're told that there are "no bad seats," but if you get a seat at the end of the row you will be right next to a tent support. We could see center stage fine, but had to lean over each other to see Penny at the front, who was the funniest part. Also, not that its a huge deal, but from the show description we were expecting some topless acts. Show has one girl in pasties, a few more in bras, but that's it. We had to sign an acknowledgement of "nudity" when we bought the tickets, so were a little disappointed there wasn't any. . . HELPFUL TIP: If you have to pick up your tickets at the box office, Absinthe has their own right next to the performance tent. We were not told this, so went to the inside box office at Caesar's Palace first. Then had a hefty walk outside to a whole different part of the casino, and hefty walk back... gave me a blister and made us late for dinner reservations!
The most amazing show I've ever seen. Burlesque meets gymnastic meets comedy.  I would see absinthe over and over. There's no bad seat in the house, it was so close and intimate. Must see in Vegas!
I must be missing something here.  Usually I trust yelp and its reviews.. . I am a huge fan of racial humor - and just about any other humor.  Basically, the best part of the show was the dialogue between the acts.. . I'm not saying what the performers did wasn't amazing, but it was five minutes of swinging someone around and then back to some racial or whatever humor dialogue.  There was nothing that tied the show together or anything that was memorable.. . I paid over $100 for a ticket to a show that barely lasted an hour.  Yes, every seat is a good view to watch, but I didn't want to watch anymore.  I was confident that this show was going to be the best I've ever seen - and it has easily become one of the worst shows I've ever seen.. . You're probably going to go see the show anyway, but don't say I didn't warn you.  I feel like I would have gotten more enjoyment losing my money in some random slot machine, but now I know.
for the actual show show i give it a 5 ! . for the crudeness and dirtiness (which i guess i expected) i give it 2 stars. . lets start with the show, it was AMAZING its a small small little place under a tent so you can basically choose any seat and youl be fine. before the show they have a bar outside and a regular drink costs about 17 bucks or so. . .  the show was really really good, it was weird and interactive but a cool thing to see. The host was okay, couldnt stand that voice...oh man. and the sidekick lady in green AHHHH i was SOOO annoyed by her i wish she wasnt in the show, i think the show would be 10 times better without her...not her fault thought i think, i think they just plan it this way but she was the worst thing about the show with the unnecessary jokes about dirty stuff... just didnt think it was necessary the show would of been just as good and funny without it. . anyways! the stuff you see in the show, without giving any of it away was amazing. i couldnt beleive what i was seeing. it almost looked fake. there were "OH WOW" moments through out the show i think youl love it. . but dont go with your parents or bring kids or anything haha its DEFINITELY not for them. its good for age groups 21-40 i think. some people i saw were disgusted but others had a crazy good time. I would reccomend!. . and the tickets were about 90 each. to sit in the middle area :)
LOVED this show!  I read the Yelp comments but want to add if you are uncomfortable with graphic talk about sex, racial/stereotype jokes or swearing this is not the show for you.  My stomach hurt from laughing. My friend & I have been talking about it for days. Penny was sooooo funny!  I could have done w/out the singer. Will definitely recommend the show to open minded people.
Saw the March 26,  2014 show and loved it. Atmosphere is raw and earthy given the tent venue and eclectic decor. This show is not for the PC-centric. The humor is naughty and tinged w/ more than a few racial and sexual and gender targets. The MC and his "assistant" filled their routines w/ taboo language and vivid descriptions of sex acts. The audience sits inches from the stage, which adds to the intimacy of the show. You'll find the typical Cirque tricks, including some really frightening ones given the spatial arrangement of the venue, and there is even an audience participation component. I plan to see the show again next time we're in Vegas.
I saw this show for free when they first appeared in Vegas. Back then they had a better Circus vibe with more activities outside the tent.  Now they only have a bar.  I guess they need to save money.  The show was very good and up close and personal.
