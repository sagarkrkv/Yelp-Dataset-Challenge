The food was great - I had the veggie mexican and it was really good.  Plenty to eat - in fact I brought half home.  The service wasn't great but I would good back because the food was good.
Killer spot. When I was traveling through Phoenix I got recommended to hit this place up for dinner. I was very stoked to get introduced to this place. It had a feel that it belongs in Portland. I never thought I would find s place like this in Arizona. Do not miss out on this spot and hit it up. My only problem is that I don't have this place in my home town.
I've been here a couple of times and it's been pretty busy. Feel free to sit at the bar; they'll still feed you there. The first time I order the Oggie and it was quite good. This past time I went for the Mexican and it was stellar. Just the right amount of spice and it served w/ salsa and sour cream as well. Be sure to order chips with your beverage or when you order your entree because they do take some time in the oven. Finally, if you're a beer drinker, I think you'll be quite pleased with the variety of beers on tap.
Fridays night, 6pm, party of 5.  No problem!. We were visiting from out of town and wanted something different.  It doesn't look like anything from the outside.  It's in a strip mall with a Mexican restaurant.  We almost didn't go in, but my college kid liked the looks of "the hipsters" sitting in the patio.  It's dark in there, but very stylish.  Service was fast and Jillian was great. The beer list is extensive and reasonable... $8 for 32 oz Guinness.  The pasties were big and delicious for about $9.  Us girls only ate 1/2 of our pasties and took the rest home.  We left room for the yummy desserts.  5 of us split 3.. So good we may come back tomorrow!
This place is worth going to at least once, but there is a lot to be desired. The food was pretty good. I had the Philly cheesesteak which was honestly not something I would recommend. But based on the reviews of those I visited the place with, I think most of the "Pasties" are probably pretty good. . . It's a very young college crowd and the place definitely has a trendy vibe to it. The waitress was very nice and that was probably the highlight. The biggest negative was the fact that the place felt quite dirty. Its probably a good thing the place was pretty dark. I think that is intentional to hide the lack of cleanliness.
This place is SO GOOD. The food is all reasonably priced, especially for the portions you receive. I've never had the beer here, but the iced teas are very good. I've also had the soups, pasties, and the apple pasty dessert and have been extremely satisfied with all of them. I try to get a different pasty each time and haven't gotten a bad one! Some tend to be a bit lighter like the eggplant, or you can get a heartier one like the shepherd's pie.. .  All of the server's are very nice and helpful. If it's a Friday or Saturday night i would make sure to get there early or send someone ahead of your group because it can get a little crowded.
I don't understand all of the hype. I had lamb vindaloo and it was meh. Just meat and potatoes. I might be willing to go back and try something different, because 800 Yelp reviewers can't all be wrong. But if I went here without seeing the awesome reviews, I would probably never return. I was expecting something spectacular and was disappointed. The service was also extremely slow. The waitress barely came around and that always makes the experience suck.
I have eaten here many a times and I highly recommend.. . I have never had a problem and the food is pretty good.
I absolutely love this place. I try to come here as often as I can. The peppered steak is my fav thing on the menu. Great place to come out with your buddies and have a beer eat some pastys and just hang out. Cornish pasty co for lyfe
I love this place. I'm one of those people who would usually find what I like on the menu and stick to it, but here, I mix it up, have eaten almost everything and I've never found anything I don't like. It's also not a bad place to grab beer or glass of wine if you're into that. Anytime I have friends or family in town this is one of the first places I want to bring them.
Cornish Pasty was very good. They have daily vegan pasty options and big beers. And I think it was Iron Maiden playing over the speakers while we sat outside and enjoyed the nice spring weather!. . Friendly service. The spicy vindaloo pasty was pretty good. To be completely honest I wasn't blown away by this particular pasty, but it was good enough to make me want to come back and try more of their veg and vegan options. Just the fact that they have these options was very nice for me!. . My dining companions were all pleased with theirs, but nobody really raved about it.. . I would come back if I were reasonably nearby, but probably wouldn't drive across town just for this.
This place is delicious (as EVERYONE says). It's really not somewhere you can go often though because the food is SO heavy. However, you must go at least once in your life. . . The wings. GET THEM. I think it's the tandoori chicken ones? They are indian inspired and probably the best wings I've ever had. . . The pastys are really hit or miss. Some of them are delicious (um, the lamb one...!) and some are just okay (the reuben..eh). Drinks are normal, they ran out of the beer I actually liked so I had to settle. But, my friends did like that they always have $3 Irish car bombs so that's definitely a plus!. . I've been to the ones in Tempe and Scottsdale and the service is a little slow but the waiters/waitresses are super nice.
Cool place, greatmusic/food. The entree & dessert pies are great, covered with delicious French pasty & full of culinary goodness. Maybe a few too many hipsters for my taste, but will still return all the same.
Having just returned from a week in Cornwall where I subsisted on a daily ration of a pasty and a bowl of soup, i had high expectations. I bought two of the traditional pasties, took them home and finished cooking them according to directions.. . They are way too hot! The spicy pepper or chili seasoning overwhelms the goodness of the meat, potato, and (presumably) rutabaga. The pastry was good, the ingredients were good, but the spice has no business being in a Cornish pasty.
This is a foodie's required stop. A menu that is genuinely thoughtful. Outstanding food and great imported draught beer selection. Must stop when stuck in an airport hotel for  mealtime.
I had myself my first Cornish Pasty the other night!  My hubby and I picked them up, so this review is plain and simple...for the food.  . . I got the Spicy Asiago Chicken with spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes.  It was fantastic!  Still piping hot by the time we opened them up to devour them.  . . Definitely a fan and can't wait to come and dine in sometime soon.  There are quite a few pasties I'm eyeballing on their menu...I loveall the choices!!
the food is so good and so many choices but like many of the reviews the service is a little off but for unique and tasty food i can deal I've only been to the Tempe one so i can't speak for the other ones yet
First off, a note about the ambience. The door is tinted black so you can't see inside, but once you open it, you'll enter into a dimly lit, but lively set up accompanied by friendly waiters. . . So what'd I eat? I got the Bangers and Mash pasty coupled with red wine gravy. It's packed with pork and sausage meat cubes (it tastes better than it looks) and mashed potatoes. It's reminiscent of the microwavable pot pies my mom used to feed me when I was little, except this one's much, much better (thank goodness). . . I also sampled my friends' selections. The Mexican is fajitas-filled, and the Pesto Chicken stands on its own league, but broke apart after the first few bites. I personally liked my pick the most, but I have a more traditional pallette. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the pasties.
