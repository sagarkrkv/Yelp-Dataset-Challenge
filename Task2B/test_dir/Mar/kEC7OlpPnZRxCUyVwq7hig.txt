I had read the reviews prior to coming to the Hard Rock and was a little concerned.  However, I really enjoyed it.  Actually, I enjoyed my stay here more than a recent stay at the Bellagio and I would rate the Hard Rock equal or above many of the other Casinos I have been to..  I stayed in the Paradise towers and the ooms are very nice.  As others have stated, the beds are very comfortable.  I enjoyed the atmosphere.  At first, I was disappointed in the casino but later I found it to be perfect for me.  It is off the strip but only a $10 taxi ride there if you want it.  To my surprise, I found I enjoyed staying off the strip.  The restaurants are very good and they have live music in some of their clubs which is something that is no longer easy to find in Vegas.  I look forward to my next visit.  Oh, and the Sports Book is great!  Best I have seen so far.
Beware!! My sister and I stayed here midweek for a conference.  While the price quoted on hotels.com is one price, once you pay with your credit card you are informed that the hotel will charge you and additional $22 "resort fee".  Now ordinarily I wouldn't mind as the pools are normally worth the extra.  Upon arriving we were informed that the pools were closed, except for one small one upstairs where everyone from the hotel was crammed into.  According to the staff the "resort fee" is for the gym, wifi, and phone calls...isn't that what the hotel charge is for (aside from the gym)?  . This was the least of our worries, as when we got into our "standard view" room overlooking the lovely air conditioning units in the Casino Tower, we discovered that our running water smelled like rotten eggs!! This is a sign of BACTERIA in the water heater!! Gross!! We asked to changed rooms and were denied.  Clearly showering was out of the question... My sister washed her face that night with the smelly BACTERIA ridden water to awake to swollen, weepy, blood-shot eyes!!  We immediately went to the front desk to demand new rooms.  Upon showing them her eyes the young man (un-phased) just said "Well thats just Vegas water, and all the rooms use the same water heater".  After hounding, I got a new room, but my sister had to wait 9 hours for hers!!  Utterly ridiculous!  So bummed about this experience, and would definitely NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone!
I am writing a review about the complete lack of customer service offered at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas.  Last week I took the Nevada Bar Exam, which is a 15  1/2 hour exam administered at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I called the University to ask for a recommendation for a hotel during my stay--they pointed me toward the Hard Rock. I paid $100.00 a night to stay there expecting the benefits that come with a nice hotel. I was unable to check in until 3:00 p.m. on the day of my arrival. However, I was told that should a room become available earlier I would be charged a fee (I think $13.00) if I wanted to check in early. .       While it is not the hotel's fault, I am not a smoker and I started to get a sore throat from the cigarette smoke.  I wanted to heat up some water in my hotel room, but I realized that I did not have a hot water pot or coffeemaker. I asked the front desk if I could please have a coffeemaker, and I was told that they were removed from all of the local hotels and one would not be provided. I asked how I could get hot water and I was told that I could purchase a cup from room service for $4.52....for a cup of hot water! Plus tip, $5.52 a cup. After being told this, I inquired with other test takers staying at nearby hotels, and despite Hard Rock's portrayal of a systematic removal of coffeemakers throughout Las Vegas, it turns out that the hotel down the street, LVH provided their guest with Keurigs in each room--and they only charge $30 per night.  Additionally, the nearby Holiday Inn also provided coffeepots to their guests. To add insult to injury, the last morning that I stayed it the hotel my room smelled like smoke when I got up in the morning..        Additionally, I was placed in a room that overlooked the roof of a lower level. While the view was not pretty, that didn't really matter. The issue that I had was that there were several fans or air conditioning units that created a buzz in the room. Again, I went down to the front desk not looking to change rooms, but to ask for earplugs. I was told that if I wanted earplugs I would need to go buy them from the convenience store in the Hard Rock. On the last day I asked for a late checkout, so that I could take my exam which ran from 8:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m., I was told that if I wanted that late of a checkout that I would need to pay an additional fee, and furthermore no rooms were available. .      While these may seem like relatively minor events they added a huge stress to an already intense week. Particularly, the fact that for four days I was unable to get any hot drinking water. In Las Vegas where there are a vast number of hotels to choose from, what sets a hotel apart is the customer service, which is beyond lacking at the Hard Rock. I do not recommend wasting your money at this "nice" hotel, because they will nickel and dime you at every turn, and for individuals who are visiting Las Vegas for pleasure rather than business, it does not even have the added benefit of being located on the strip.
Seriously awesome time at The Hard Rock!  I just got back from a three night stay for a business convention and I got to stay in the HRH Tower.  . . I was a bit worried about being off the Strip but it actually ended up being really nice!  The Strip was bumper to bumper the whole time I was there and the HRH Tower has a back entrance and a parking lot attached to it so I was one turn down Harmon and Koval Street away from my conference at the MGM and never had to deal with traffic from the Strip.  We went to Caeser's one night in the evening and I was able to take the back road right there, it was a breeze!  And the parking lot is attached right to the HRH Tower so there were no crazy long walks to my room like some of those ridiculously large Strip hotels.  . . My room was beautiful.  I had a King Suite with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in at a Hotel.  No joke, this was a pillow top mattress that I just melted into.  The bathroom was uber cool, with a walk-in shower, two sinks and a full size bath tub.  I loved the centralized music system that played any kind of music I could have wanted as I was getting ready and having some people over.  The lounge area of my room was spacious and comfortable and everyone thought my motorized curtains were awesome!  . . I got to try several restaurants while I was there and I really loved them all.  We had an awesome dinner at Nobu, a great quick lunch at Pink Taco and another excellent dinner at the Chinese/Thai place called Fu.  . . The conference kept me from going to the pool but I walked the grounds one night and the whole pool area was unbelievable!  There's a beach, tons of pools, a water slide, it looked like a blast.  . . The Customer service for me was great!  The check in was quick and the lady behind the counter was super nice, answered all my lame questions about where all the good restaurants were and took the time to show me everything on a map.  Maybe this was just because I was in the HRH Tower, I don't know but that Tower sure made me feel like I was in a VIP area.  I can't wait to go back and take advantage of that pool in the Summer!
This hotel matches my style perfectly. Sometimes Ive got to catch myself head banging to the music playing overthe speakers. Gotta love ROCK music :) I love the rock and roll theme they have going on! We flew from Reno to Las Vegas, ended up getting here late, like 1 am late, but the employees were still bright eyed a bushy tailed. So polite!! . Although they allow smoking in the casino, the casino floor doesn't reek of cigarette smoke. . My bed was sooo comfortable. I slept like a baby. My view of Vegas was gorgeous from my window. The pool below is absolutely stunning. I've never seen anything like it. Unfortunately it's been really windy since we flew in last night, so hopefully we'll get to try it out before we leave. . I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay at a fun hotel. There's a wide variety of places to eat and a few places to shop.
Seriously worst hotel I have ever stayed at.  Our experience upon arrival set the stage for an awful stay at this hotel.  First we were greeted by an unpleasant bell hop who rudely told us that we were not able to bring in our coolers.  I politely told him I disagreed and carried them to my room anyways.  It would have been one thing if he was nice about the rule, but the way he was so rude about it rubbed me the wrong way.  Then next we had called ahead to see what time check in was.  They said it would be at 3.  We arrived at 4:30 and the lady rudely told us our room was not ready and that check in was from 3-5 and therefore we could come back at 5.  We get to our room, there were only two sets of towels and we had three girls staying in our room.  We called for towels and two hours later they still hadn't showed up.  We called again and finally we received two more towels.  SO glad they could spare only TWO.  I would never stay here again and am so disgusted with the way we were treated that I had to write a negative review.
Stayed here for NYE in Dec 2013. Loved it!! We (my friend and I) got 2 queen sized beds in one shares room which was perfect. The beds were amazing!!!! Super big and comfy, very clean and lovely. Nice spacious rooms with modern touches. Quirky art and funky wall paper. House keeping daily, staff is very pleasant. Our bag handler was extremely rude and obnoxious!! The location is decent, not too far from everything. Subway, cvs and a few restaurants are within walking distance. Will stay here again.
Over rated hotel! So the positive are a comfortable bed, a large room, and a great pool scene. The downfall to this hotel is the cleanliness, kept up furniture, loud neighbors ( I mean do I have to listen to you have sex all night? Haha), and the hallways smell like cigarettes. . . I hear that staying in the HRH Towers is better! So I guess I won't rule this hotel out yet. But whatever you do, do not stay in the casino tower. . . The pool scene was fun. Beginning of the season so not crowded at all which was nice. The drinks are definitely over priced at the pool so I recommend not ordering them. I mean do you really expect me to pay $30 for a double? That $30 better be for double grey goose bottles. :) the downfall to the pool area is there so many restrictions of what you can take inside. I mean I had to go back to my room twice to empty my purse or just not take it. Seriously Hard Rock?!! Ridiculous!  . . My experience at this hotel is so so... From the time I got out of the car and being sexually harassed by all the security guards to laying pool side... I guess I can give a more final review staying in a different tower.. . You get one more chance hard rock don't blow it! :) oh and on a final, I'm loving the rock style!
I can understand why this place gets wildly differing reviews.  A lot really seems to depend on your luck of the draw here.  As it happens, we got really lucky with our stay, and it turned out to be a great experience.  . . We showed up after midnight on a Sunday night.  All of the rooms with a king bed were booked, so we got bumped up to a suite in the HRH Tower.  This was a GIANT upgrade considering we only paid $37 a night for the room.  I probably wouldn't think as much of the place if we didn't get that upgrade.  Sure, you still have to pay a $22 resort fee, which is silly, but every place in Vegas charges this now, so it is hard to knock Hard Rock for this.  So, we still only paid $59 a night for a very nice suite.  . . With the HRH Tower, you get your own check-in and concierge area, which is much quieter and faster than the main one.  You also get your own garage, which was very fast in and out, free parking.  The suite had two big wardrobes and a wetbar when you walk in.  Then a living room area with a big sectional, its own TV and desk area. Then you walk into the bedroom, spacious with EXTREMELY comfy beds.  I think I need one of these at home!  The view looked out to the parking garage, but if you looked to the side there was a pretty good view of the south end of the Strip from MGM down to Mandalay.  Finally, the bathroom was excellent - separate toilet nook, huge shower with overhead shower available, and a large soaking tub.  We never heard any noise from anyone else while we were in the room, even though we definitely heard people playing music in their rooms as we walked through the hallway, so we got great sleep here. Speaking of which, we did enjoy having a selection of rock music to play in the room on their sound system.. . We got lucky and had some nice hits at the slots in the casino, and also played the roulette and craps tables.  The casino was very popular at night here.  We also went to Nobu and Pink Taco.  Nobu just to try appetizers at the bar - main meals were very expensive, but I enjoyed the sushi.  Pink Taco was actually very reasonably priced.  I had lobster tacos and my wife had the chicken fajitas.  Both came with good sized portions and were tasty.  Try the queso for an appetizer, as long as you like chorizo mixed in, it was very good.  I would recommend anyone to try Pink Taco here.  Wait, what?. . We checked out the party pool, it was pretty popular for being still in March.  A young crowd there, they have DJs on stage, bars set up, the whole thing.  So we got to have a "club" experience without going through all the nightclub BS.  Keep in mind you have to pay to rent a daybed or cabana like you would a table at a nightclub.  So we just sat on the beach area and on the side of the pool like most of the people.  To get away for a bit, we went up to the little "Breathe" pool.  This is a SMALL pool though, so it got crowded, you can't really swim around in it too much.  There is also a bar up there, good drinks but expensive at $16.  . . The location is off the Strip, next to the UNLV campus.  So yes, I would definitely recommend having a car.  It was very easy to get in and out through the HRH garage.  They supposedly have a "no outside food/drink" rule but no one hassled us or searched us for snacks, water, beers, etc.  Of course, we weren't hauling around cases or anything.  No fridge or microwave in the room, though.. . Overall, the employees were very helpful and friendly here, got very good service.  At $59/night for a suite, we got amazing value.
If you are looking for a family friendly place than this isn't the place for you and I'm not a fan of the standard rooms but the HRH tower is great. Comfy bed, large room, and great restaurants. Great atmosphere for a fun night but if you plan on leaving you'll need a taxi because its off the strip and not walkable in heels. It was a great staycation.
Clean room, large bathroom, and comfy beds.  I won't talk about the price, because it was outrageous, but to be fair, I came last minute on a holiday weekend.  Still, it seemed a little overrated for being off the strip.  I think I would rather spend the same amount of money and stay somewhere on the strip (even if the room isn't as nice).
Ok so my wife and I came here for our 1 year anniversary and it was both of our first Vegas trip. We arrived early, like 10am so our room wasn't ready, the guy at check in said it should be ready around 2pm when regular check in is 4 and would call us if it was ready but he never called, we got back at 3 and luckily our room was ready, our room was fine, the one big problem was we never knew any hotel has hidden fees, like 150$ total and that killed our fun money spending but we got 100$ back after check out. So other than that we would rate it 5 stars. . . We loved the Rock History memorabilia displays throughout the hotel, my personal favorite was Paul McCartney's Bass and it was right by the elevators. . . Pink Taco was good, not the best Mexican Restaurant ever but still good, I tried the pink tacos and theywere really delish, my wife's enchiladas however were not the greatest. . . Fuel Coffee shop... If there's a Starbucks around go there first, make this place your last resort. How do you screw up a caramel macchiato? And a medium black coffee was $3.75! Starbucks is only 2 bucks for regular black coffee. Oh well but  the donuts were Bomb! . . We never used the pool I didn't want to even bother with it hot and crowded. Didn't use wifi as all hotels anywhere on the planets is horrible we just stuck with our data anyway. . . Last thing (just to those who don't know) if you just sit at the slots and play the hotel will comp your drinks for playing just tip the waitress a couple bucks for it. Hey 3 bucks for tipping is better than 12 for drinks.
My friend and I decided at the last minute to take a quick trip to Vegas. The only hotel with a casino that looked decent was near the strip and that was affordable happened to be the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. I was somewhat skeptical but decided to go ahead and book the room. Check in was at 3:00 pm. we arrived at 3:30 to a 45 minute wait in line. When I reached the front of the line I found that my room was not ready and I would need to continue to wait until a room was available. The girl said they would call us. After sinking a $100 dollars in their machines and an hour later we still had not been called. We went back to the registration desk and the gentleman ( wished I would have gotten his name) was very helpful. He found us a room and sent us on our way. When we arrived in the room we were pleasantly surprised as we had been given an up-grade to a suite with a pool view. We absolutely enjoyed the room over the pool and the music that came blasting in. We were in heaven. We ate at the cafe. I had to send back my original order of baked chicken and rice (it was horrible). I opted for a burger which was GREAT. When not staying on the strip and looking for a hotel with a  casino this will be my first choice.
The rooms are nice. The pool is great. The passed out person in my hallway was not what I had expected. This hotel is fantastic for couples. It is however NOT good for families.
Man ist das ein Erlebnis. Wir hatten echt Gluck dazu. Unter der Woche zahlt man auch gerne mal nur 25USD fur ein Zimmer. Dazu kam noch ein Upgrade, weil wohl Zimmer frei waren, so dass wir gemutlich in der 20. Etage mit Blick auf Vegas unser groes Zimmer beziehen durften.. . Alles nagelneu, richtig sauber, grozugig gestaltet, tolles Bad, super Matratzen, sehr guter Service. Da gab es echt wenig bis nichts auszusetzen.. . Das Casino macht auch Spa, aber ganz ehrlich... zentral ist es hier nicht und wer mehr Action will nimmt sich ein Taxi fur 10 USD und fahrt auf den Strip. Aber das kann ja jeder fur dich entscheiden. . . Jedoch bietet das Hard Rock alles was man braucht. Wie so oft eine eigene Stadt in der Stadt. . Tattoo gefallig. Geht hier 24/7. . Hunger? 24/7.. Geld verzocken 24/7.. . Getranke gibt es wahrend man am spielen ist, so oder so "gratis" dazu. Wer da den Uberblick verliert, merkt dann schnell wie teuer so ein Getrank werden kann. Mit dem Pegel steigt die Spielfreude. Und so schnell kann man gar nicht schauen, da ist die Kohle auch schon weg. . . Aber sind wir mal ehrlich. Wer nach Vegas geht um Geld zu gewinnen, der hat schon verloren.. . Also jeden Abend mit einer bestimmten Menge an Geld vor die Tur - Kreditkarte im Hotelsafe lassen und auf gehts. . Dann kommen auch keine bosen Uberraschungen morgens auf dem Heimweg.. . . Wer gunstig und modern ubernachten will, sollte sich fur das Hard Rock entscheiden. Etwas Abseits vom Strip hat man hier auch mal die notige Ruhe nach einer durchzechten Nacht. Nicht dass ich wusste von was ich rede :)
Not a fan of big casino hotels but I didn't have a choice on this one. The line for check-in was enormous, as was the line to store baggage. It took more than 30 minutes to drop off a bag (and 30 minutes more to pick it up) while waiting for my room.. . The room is extremely dark. Good thing I don't wear makeup because you couldn't see anything in the bathroom. Could barely see the soap I showered with. The lights at the night stand were both out and the alarm was left on (check these things, people!) so I had a friendly 5:37 a.m. wakeup buzz.. . The mandatory resort fee was $22 per night or so, and didn't include a seat by the pool, which requires that you spend wads of cash on food and drink for the privilege of sitting on a chair. I was shooed away at 10:30 a.m. when no one else was there because I wouldn't plunk down the cash.. . The "free" pool closes at 6 p.m. Stupid, like the hours for the gym, which is only open from like 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.. . The big deal-breaker is that they don't have coffee makers in the room, like most casino hotels. I always thought that a hotel in Vegas with a coffee maker and bright lights in the rooms could make a fortune.. . P.S. Not impressed by the rock-and-roll memorabilia.
