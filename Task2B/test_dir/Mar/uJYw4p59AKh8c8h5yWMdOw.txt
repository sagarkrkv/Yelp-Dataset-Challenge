Stayed here last night and got a room with a view of the Strip. The view was nice, but the window was very small and only one or two people at a time can see out of it. The room itself was decent, but nothing special, although the bed was pretty comfortable. Found a few small stains on the blanket, which is never good.. bathroom would be nice if it was the 90s but could definitely use a lot of improvement. For $210+, you can definitely do better at other hotels on the Strip.
Giving the hotel two stars mainly because of price, location and proximity to the sights and sounds on the main hub of the strip. Other than that, this hotel is struggling. The room was beat up and dated with no refrigerator, a broken safe and a super small window overlooking the strip - and if you are paying for a view upgrade, you would expect much more. The positive was that we could easily access other hotels and restaurants and from that perspective it was good. But there really is nothing about this hotel that makes you want to stay there and enjoy yourself, or look forward to a future stay. It's old and a walk across the street to the Cosmo or Aria really shows what you are missing. If you can afford to stay elsewhere, I would recommend it.
The only reason I booked a room there was for a convention at Planet Hollywood. I was disappointed in the "resort". First the parking is truly a 15 minute walk. and if you rie a motorcycle it is not like you can use valet parking, and you will walk quite a distance with your bags. Before I booked a room there I specifically asked about parking for my bike and was told there will be plenty of parking but when I got there I had to maneuver an 800 lb motorcycle thru bicycles and scooters that were parked every which way. . After my hike to the reservation desk the cashier informed me I cold not opt out to pay cash at the end of my stay. my CC would have the amount placed on "hold" and in essence holds the amount of money basically at ransome. I have been at other hotels that did not have to do that and were glad to have my CC info but did not hold funds on my CC. . We found our way to the elevators and found Brittney Spears plastered everywhere! The decor felt dated and there was not the clean feeling one would expect. . When I opened the door the room reeked of cigarette smoke! Then I found an ashtray so I called the front desk. Turns out that the cashiers just put us in a smoking room with gout ever asking if we smoke! And he figured we would want to stay in the room for four days....didn't ask us if we smoked?  Well I guess that was MY fault since I had on a motorcycle jacket he profiled all bikers as smokers. They should ask each person if they would like a smoking or non smoking room. . So now the room doesn't really feel clean. The room was sufficient and the decor was 90's. The bathroom was large and had a large soaking tub and separate shower and so that was nice!. My first morning there I placed the hotel "Do not disturb sign" in place. They came in anyways. The next night I wanted the room clean...they did not come clean the room and then I found a weird matt stain on the bathroom floor. So do they wash the marble floors between guests?. Down in the mezzanine I had a drink with my lunch and the glass was cracked! apx 3 inches of it. I think they were so fast to set the tables they didnt care/notice such a large crack. . So lets try the Miracle mile mall.....all very nice. Things of all price points BUT be careful three of the stores there ring up the price by rounding UP! Yes Ocean one charged our friend $48 for a bill that was first shown as 47.24 but the waiter rang it and rounded up. When this was brought to his attention he said they always do that. Its just the way it is done. After my friend made a fuss the waiter all of 20 something...took the bill back. dug in his apron pocket and gave my friend the difference...Do you think THAT problem will ever be resolved? NO so YOU will be the next over charged person!. Next stop Popcorn...same thing! one price listed for pop corn but then the over charge and dont have an answer as to why. Ver nice to us but didnt change the price until after the manager was called in....seems that is STANDARD practice there!. In the end when I checked out and when I was asked if my stay was ok I told them all that happened...right down to the bathroom floor not being washed. The young girl said she was sorry but my bill was never adjusted. I told her I will never stay there again. You pay a price and have a certain expectation and it just isn't met, period. . My convention was good but I will not go back there again.
My girlfriend says it's the best hotel ever, I wouldn't go that far but it's a excellent stay.  Stayed on the eight floor In a beautiful upgraded room. The service is nice and the location is great. It's one of cleaner casinos and has a lot of shopping to do as well.
I can't stand staying here...Doesn't matter if I got the card and winning money and get free night stays I just can't get over the fact that the parking is eons away from the elevators. I don't mind the rooms. The rooms are in fact classy and sophisticated. Trendy I would say, but the walk from the parking...drive me nuts. I just want to get from my car without going around miracle mile (wow maybe that's why they call it that? - yeah I know miracle mile in LA it's just about a mile to walk to the elevators lol) I  can do the free valet thing but the wait just to get your car is the same as if you walked to your car or even more...I wish they just had a hallway that cut down the middle since apparently the entrance of the parking is directly parallel to the entrance of the casino and doesn't matter which way you go, its still freaking far. I swear when I stayed there 3 times, the 3rd time I found that going to the right was faster since to the left you pass the water thing but I think I was just delusional or think that I was going in the nearest direction possible.
Stayed in Resort room for three nights in Feburary 2014.. . The Good: Large room and huge bathroom for the price.  We were very impressed with the room itself.  Best value for location in Las Vegas.  The cafe is large with a wide selection of foods and reasonably pricing. . . The bad:  Koi night club in the hotel is tacky and promoters everywhere trying to 'walk you in' for $20 each (including girls).  Fitness center allows only two persons per room and requires ID to enter the damn thing.  This is especially irritating since we had a two bed and four roommates wanting to workout indoors since Vegas weather tends to beoverly dry for morning runs. Internet in room costs extra but there is a Starbucks in the casino.
Visited for a show, did not stay at the hotel.  From the beginning it was a trial.  The valet service is painfully slow, coming and going.  Hotel staff we encountered in the lobby were curt to the point of rudeness.  . . Sat at a show that had massive amounts of fog machines but we were told that e-cigarettes were not allowed.  Ya know, e-cigarettes?  The things that produce only water vapor? Like the fog machines?  I had actually only used it a couple of times, and very discreetly, so obviously the usher was just a staring jerk (jealous, maybe?). We were front row, for the price we paid you would think we'd have been left alone to enjoy our show. . . To top it off, for some unknown reason their waitresses are dressed as cheap prostitutes.  I guess I had a different vision of what this place was going to be.  I though maybe a little class but it's a slightly run-down, kind of dirty feeling place.
I've stayed at Planet Hollywood twice now... The first time (August 2013) I stayed there I LOVED it. I love that it has a young vibe and it's very colorful. That caught my eye. We ended up with a room themed of some Cindy Crawford that I didn't even know, but whatevs. I like the casino, it's always poppin with young folks.. Not a lot of older people like at a lot of the other casinos (not that there's anything wrong with that). The spice market buffet was really good also, so I left there very pleased with my experience and knew I wanted to stay there again. The only complaintI had the first time I stayed there was our neighbors who complained of noise because there kid was sleeping...? Um, ok we're in Vegas... Hello!! But whatever, it was 5am. . For our march 2014 trip we decided to book at PH again. We checked in and went up to our room which was Crocodile Dundee themed. Bummer. I hate that movie. But again, whatever. When I looked around the room, I realized the entertainment center holding the TV and stuff was missing drawers and doors. Hella janky!! I paid $150 a night and would have expected decent, so that brought my stars down from 4 (possibly 5) to 3. Spice Market again was pretty good, specifically champagne brunch. My favorite!! But the food selection was exactly the same as the last time I went. Boooorrrriiiiinnnngggg.
I love vegas !!!!! And always stay at my home away from home the Venetian . We are always treated grate there and well respected never a issue . At the end of February I was sent out by Harley Davidson for a event at Planet Hollywood . I had to attend a bunch of early and all day functions there . So I thought it might be a good idea to stay whit planet Hollywood . I could go up and down the elevator from my room and to the function and back and forth easyer and didn't have to worrie about driving . I read the reviews and it seemed like a fine place to stay and was excited . Well from the start when we arrived I stead of having valet immediately assisting us when we pulled up we had to go and get them and ask for help and it seemed like we where bothering them . And they weren't that busy either . So while my wife delt with valet the rest of us went to the putter 40 and parked our bikes . Checked in with only 2 people checking in a HUGE check in line . Took a while . Then we got out room went in and found it in bad shape . 3 things first the bathroom drain was clogged and not draining . Being a plumber I worked on it and got it draining just ok with the little things I had with me . Second the carpet was all bunched up in the middle of the room like a speed bump and we where tripping on it the hole time there . Third one of the main lamps that produced light in the room was broken and dangling on its base. Like a tripod with lamp shad hanging on its side . . . That's the room . The stuff I was there for went fine . But while I was busy my wife and  another wife spent the day together and it seemed like every where they went every one was  RUDE to them first just tryin to call the bell desk took for ever and in the end they had to go down stairs to talk to them instead of the phone because they wouldn't anwser. Took over a day just to talk to the concert box off on how much tickets where? Then they tryed to eat at the Buffett in the hotel and where behinde a person that had been waiting at the front of the line for some time  and was passed up by the cashier because they where to busy helping the five star card members and when they where dun with one then a nother would come up and again and again and again . My wife was getting frustrated so she said something to the manger and he treated her like shit telling her that the five star people spend a lot of $ to be at that status and that they come first . Like the rest of us and our $ if no good . H he went a a far as to make fun of them , laugh at them , then called security on them to have them leave . In the end they ended up eating in the mall . . . Then Friday night yes we are only to Friday . All this happened between Thursday and Friday . . . So Friday might we had a HUGE !!!! Party in a banquet room and even there the wait staff seemed like we where bothering them and was  difficult just to even get coffee . Goan as far as to that I had to go get the pitcher of water and coffee for our table . By the way this party was for over a 1000 people no small get to gether . . . In the end I will never stay here again not even if they give ma a free room I would rather   Stay at the Venetian . The only nice thing I would say about the room was that the beds and bedding was nice . . . Good luck with your decision. That's my openion .
The service here was not great, particularly in the sports book. It was 9am and I was still on Eastern Time, so I got up and headed down to the casino. I'm sure no one is happy to be working the early shift (or quite possibly the tail end of the graveyard shift) at a casino but I went up to ask the teller if they permitted bets on Division II games, and before I could even get the question out - I had just said "I have a quick question for you" - she said she needed to see my ID. I understand that I'm young and that it's required to be in the casino, but she could have at least let me ask my question first and asked for my ID more politely. I wasn't even placing a bet yet. There was a much more tactful way to go about this. I also mistakenly gave her my MLife card, thinking Planet Hollywood was a MGM resort, and she kind of gave me an attitude when she told me it was a Total Rewards hotel. Sorry, I'm not from the area, and neither are the other 40 million people here right now, so perhaps change your attitude and be a little more helpful with the tourists, or go find a job on Fremont Street where they look for people with attitudes.
This Review is for my experience with the Jacksons showroom staff - it started at Will Call picking up tickets and the first person who helped me was really wonderful.  She had great seat options available and we ended up at table 1 right at the stage.   It was very apparent that she liked her job and enjoyed helping create a great customer service experience.  Once in the theater I was assisted by Judith & later Mary who worked very hard to accommodate a last minute seat for a 3rd person to be near us.  I was so happy with their kindness and effort all to make our experience great.  Very well done - I will definitely try to see more shows there!  As far as the Jackson go - they've still got it! It amazes me what energy these guys have after a lifetime of performing.  This is the 2nd time I've seen them and this performance was outstanding.
Planet Hollywood in Vegas sucks for the following reasons . . 1. Service sucks at valet (even if you don't drive around forever trying to even find it). . 2. Concert venue was WAY understaffed - not enough bartenders (6) or organization for the crowd of people (6000) waiting to get a beer. A bartender was counting his tips while hundreds waited for drinks. . . 3. Have hounds trying to sell you timeshares but they are sneaky and ask if you wouldn't mind touring a new section of the hotel for a bunch of free shit. Who doesn't want free shit? A bus ride, presentation and 4 hrs later FML. . 4. Cocktail waitress told me she was too busy to talk to me - I simply needed quick directions. . . 5. While gambling our cocktail waitress was impatient and acted disgusted she even had to deal with us. Sorry I tipped you $5 for two Coronas. . . 6. Internet kept kicking me off and was referred to a tech support like that's what I wanted to be doing on vacation. . 7. No mini fridge in over priced suite. . 8. Casino floor is like a labyrinth, confusing and cluttered. . . To be fair:. . 1. the rooms were nice (still over priced) and we had an awesome view. . . 2.Our roulette dealer was nice, and there was one security employee who personally walked where we wanted to go.. . 3. Scantly clad women are dealers in one section which is pleasing to the eyes.. . Basically, stay at Mandalay Bay, The Venetian, Palazzo, Trump Tower or Bally's instead. All are way better than Planet Hollywood.
I attended a conference at Planet Hollywood (PH), Las Vegas last week (Mar 9th to Mar 15th).  The only reason I stayed there was because the conference had a package deal with the hotel.  In retrospect, I should had stayed in another hotel and just cab it every day to the conference.  The only thing PH has going for it is its location.  Excellent location on the strip, but the actual hotel and service, I would rank it with a Best Western or Holiday Inn. .  . When we arrived at the hotel (around 1:00 PM), it took us almost 30 minutes to check-in.  During check-in, the front staff told me that there is an "early check-in fee of $16.00"?!?!?!?!  What the hell!  I actually laughed when they told me this, as I have never heard of this!  Usually in ALL other hotels in this world, if the room is ready, you can check-in, no problem, if not, you wait.  But, according to PH, the early check-in fee is Caesars' Entertaining policy!  I am still shaking my head on that one, you would think in Vegas, the faster you get your hotel guest in the casino the better..  . The room was no better than any other 3-start hotel that I have stayed in the past.  Room was in desperate need of an update.  Carpet, bed, furniture, etc in need of replacement.  The closet was actually missing a door!  Cool pictures on the wall, but who cares about that.  Not me..  . Internet - there is a charge of $14 per day... now that is expected for most hotels, but wait for it.... $14 per day.... PER DEVICE!  Yes, per device!  Laptop, that's $14 and IPad that's another $14... that's about $30 per day plus tax!   I have never heard of that one either!  Now that's two things I have never heard or experienced with any other hotel anywhere in Vegas or in this world for that matter.  During the conference, this was a hot topic.... It is nothing and the hotel dismisses it when one person complains about this fee and "one device policy", but when a whole group of conference attendees is discussing the same issue and feel the same way, PH, you need to pay attention!.  . Pool - Closed!  In March! Now, they told us we could use the pool in the Paris hotel... hmmm.... OK, if you have ever been to Vegas, you know how close and "walkable" Vegas can be.  Just a short little trip to the next hotel to use the pool.... Yeah... right..  . Gym - Now usually, when we go to Vegas, who uses the gym... right?  But, since it was a conference and it was 6 days we tried to use the gym.... But wait for it.... again... must be a PH (Caesars' Entertaining) thing... there is a charge of $25 per day.... That's OK.... But that's PER PERSON!  Crap!  So, for the two of us that's $50 per day, $250 for the week, that's more than what my gym membership costs for the WHOLE YEAR!  What's with this hotel and their Mickey Mouse nickel and dime game!.  . As I mentioned before, PH is in a great location.  But, PH caters to the younger crowd (21 to 25 years old) that is there just to gamble and drink, probably why it can get away with its "policies".  But a more seasoned traveler will know better and see through this sham.  I for one, will skip this hotel next time we go to Vegas, we will still visit the Miracle Mile Mall, but skip Planet Hollywood.  With so many WAY BETTER hotels in the immediate area, why stay at Planet Hollywood?  I don't see any reason.. . I would sincerely hope the conference organizers pick a better hotel next time.
We stayed here the 3rd weekend of February '13. We came to see Britney & wanted to stay where the show was located. The room was your average hotel room. We purchased a packaged deal on Travelocity. We had the average/generic room with two queen beds. They placed us on the 7th floor which actually had an obstructed view of the strip. We didn't ask for this or pay extra for it. It was a nice view at night. We stayed three nights & definitely enjoyed our stay. The room was pretty clean but not spectacular. I would stay here again if the price was right & planned to see Britney. Oh & our room had items from the movie "Hook." The bathtub was great! Beautiful garden tub + a stand-up shower!
Well what can be said that hasnt been.Apparently the wife beat me to it. After beeing trx fo Vegas via the old company that decides to get greedy I found myself Out on my ass and with a new wife(first passed) and just older kids. But as they say, life and the show go on. So Acting bug bites my behind and now after being in Vegas. and seeing every imploded hotel BELLAGIO is built.It will Always have my heart,soul.But Planet Hollywood. says THEY WILL do it better!! Ok Dave Front Desk Supervisor let us c what you got. Moms day my and my daughters B/ d hmm. Make it worth my time . Make mee say that the BELLAGIO is no more than whst it ONCE WAS)))((())). lets c if this really works........Dave you may have Mighty big shoes to fill. Actually you can ask Juilianna Lete. Shes married now and a Hostess with the most infectious smile and way about her. She actually got lured away from the Bellagio to the Mandalay Bay....Although we didn't have her for a long time the time we had the ability to make things happen.....She was aliving doll. she knew us better than we knew ourselves:) lets c what dave can do.................actually its hard to give this review anything~
Once you get past the disorganized and confusing shit show that is their shopping mall Planet Hollywood is actually an interesting casino with a great open floor plan to the gaming area and plenty of unique areas to explore.  Featuring plenty of entertainment options and venues plus a few eateries worth checking out plus one of the more spacious parking structures on the central strip I think pH and the Miracle Mile Shops provide an intermediate between the low and the high of Vegas, the sort of place where there is something for everyone but at the same time nothing in particular worth 'seeking out.'
We didn't stay at Planet Hollywood, but spent a LOT of time there on our most recent trip - gambling, eating, drinking, and shopping. . . Casino - nice and spread out. Craps dealers are all great and craps tables were always fun when we were playing (maybe it was because WE made it fun;) ). There's a starbucks within the casino, which is VERY nice- especially since we all got in late after a full days work and just wanted to grab a quick sandwich in between gambling. . . Food - we ate at Cabo Wabo, starbucks, late night @ Earl of sandwich, and PF Changs. All were great - friendly servers/employees, great food, good drinks (PF), etc. PF Changs should probably have asked the 4 20something year olds who were already intoxicated who came in to eat lettuce wraps and do saki bombs and drink a ridiculous amount (us....) to leave the nice, family friendly atmosphere... but they didn't... and we were grateful ;) . . Shopping - countless number of shops - only shopped for an hour or so, but they have everything from clothing stores to electronic stores to souvenir shops.. . **THEY HAVE GARRETTS POPCORN** - I literally saw a guy carrying a bag of popcorn from the corner of my eye in the casino, recognized it as garretts bag, and followed him (im not creepy i promise) until I caught up to see where he got it from... and it was in their mall.... Needless to say, THIS previous chitown resident was THRILLED ;)
Just checked into PH Las Vegas. Our shower doesn't work, there's mold around it and mold around the sink. Asked for a different room (we got a 2 queen bedroom. There's 4 of us)...what did they offer us? A one king room. For FOUR ppl?! Wtf? Or wait til tomorrow for a different room. Had already booked a room for edc 2014 best believe I am canceling it and going some where else.
