Amazing. Simply amazing. Cannot go wrong with the menu and the alcoholic milkshakes are a must!
This place blew me out of the water. The line was a little long, but thats because its so good. The burgers are fresh and you can even build your own burger. check it out if youre in the area.
Burger Bar was just meh... Especially for the price! The four of us got lucky, and ended up finding spots at the bar, or else the wait was over an hour long (ridiculous!) My friends, who are lovers of foie gras, were excited to try the Kobe burger with seared foie gras (which is now banned in CA). This burger was an expensive $60, and my friends were really disappointed by the taste. The foie gras pieces were small and not of good quality. Good thing I opted out of the foie gras burger! I ended up just getting the American Classic, which was not any better. Nothing super great about it, meat was whatevers, and the burger actually came out a lil cold. It did not taste like "right off the grill" temperature. Would not spend the money or come back!
***Many Las Vegas restaurants let their quality standards slip once they have been around for a while and that is the case with Hubert Keller's Burger Bar; Burger Bar is still a decent value compared to the many overpriced high-end restaurants on The Strip, but there are several new gourmet burger spots in Vegas (like Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood) that are probably more exciting***. . There are several reasons to visit Hubert Keller's Burger Bar.  It is from a celebrity chef (Hubert Keller), but it is a relatively inexpensive restaurant (at least compared to the many expensive celebrity chef backed fine dining restaurants on The Strip).  It also primarily features two items--burgers and milkshakes--that are very popular.  Finally, Hubert Keller was on Top Chef Masters and showcased this restaurant as well as his burger skills so many might be intrigued with this one if they saw that season of Top Chef Masters on the Food Network.. . This Burger Bar (there is also one located in the Macy's in San Francisco) is housed in Mandalay Place--a mini-mall within Mandalay Bay that features a few retail and dining options.  It is a fairly small place and the menu showcases a build-your-own-burger concept where you pick your burger protein--several types of beef, lamb, buffalo, turkey, and veggie as well as chicken breast and salmon.  You then choose your desired bun as well as all kinds of toppings including raw vegetables, grilled vegetables, many types of cheese (standard stuff like American and cheddar but also brie and smoked Gouda), several sauces, additional proteins like bacon and prosciutto, and finally a few premium ingredients like seared foie gras and black truffle.  You can also order one of their signature chef's burger creations so you do not have to make any choices.. . In addition to their burgers, Burger Bar also serves all kinds of fried food from French fries and onion rings to zucchini fries and mozzarella sticks.  Chicken wings and a few salads are available too.. . I went the build-your-own-burger route and opted for their Prime ground beef and added bacon, smoked Gouda and spinach on a potato bun.  The burger was okay.  I thought the burger at the newer Gordon Ramsay BurGR was much better--the beef was much juicier there and it featured both a higher quality bun as well as higher quality toppings.  The burger at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar was okay, but only the really thick and meaty (crispy but also chewy) bacon stood out.  The bun felt very plain for a gourmet burger spot.. . I also opted for one of their milkshakes.  They have all kinds of milkshakes from build-your-own-milkshakes with many toppings to signature creations.  I tried their caramel latte, which featured coffee ice cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels.  It was a great mix of caramel and coffee and the milkshake had a great thick and creamy consistency (very addictive and hard to put down).. . Service was good--pleasant and quick.. . Prices are reasonable for a notable Las Vegas restaurant.  Burger Bar's prices are higher than similar gourmet burger restaurants in other big cities like Los Angeles, but that is to be expected given that Burger Bar is on The Strip.  Burger Bar does offer a decent meal that comes at a much lower price than the many celebrity chef backed (and very pricey) fine dining restaurants on The Strip.. . I remember liking Burger Bar more on my first trip.  It is not too surprising that the quality has dropped since then; the quality standards at many Vegas restaurants seem to slip if it has been around for a long time.  Hubert Keller's Burger Bar is still a decent spot, but Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood is a much better option for an gourmet burger on The Strip.. . Burger Bar is located in Mandalay Place, which is attached to Mandalay Bay.  Like other major casinos and hotels on The Strip, Mandalay Bay offers both complimentary self and valet parking.
This is a must stop when visiting Vegas!  The burgers are phenomenal and the milkshakes are fantastic.
Great staff, great service, great burgers and awesome craft beer selection!
PARCHMENT PAPER COOKED INTO VEGGIE PATTIES. When we showed the waitress, she kept saying how weird that was. And when we suggested it might be parchment paper used to form or separate the patties, she acted like that was crazy talk. Well either she's not a cook herself and/or never goes into the kitchen, because she took the burger back to show the cooks, and came back and informed us that is was indeed parchment paper cooked into an otherwise lovely burger. And then preceded to give us the bill and have us pay for the parchment paper burger.
My friend and I were going to a concert at the House of Blues, and were hungry.  The restaurant where we were going to watch the concert at, had at least a 20 minute wait.  Since we were on a time crunch, we decided to see if we could find a place that was a little more accommodating.  . . Enter the Burger Bar.  As a fairly recent vegan convert, I was skeptical by the name of the joint.  It just conjures up unappealing visions of ground beef.  I figured they must have some type of veggie burger and took my chances.  Lo and behold, there was a veggie burger, and it sounded good, it was a chef creation with great ingredients that you would find in a vegan burger, even caramelized onions went into the making this burger...but it's not vegan because they put cheese into the patty, not on it.  I was hoping it was placed on top, and I could just order it without the cheese.  So disappointing.  But on the bright side, there was a Vegan Vegas burger, baby!  It had grilled eggplant, red pepper, and Portobello mushrooms acting as the bun.  No bread in this baby. I had a side of fries and a pickle spear.  It was delicious, and such a huge portion that I couldn't eat it all.
Overrated.. . It's a good burger. Service and quality are great, but $30 for a [mediocre] burger, fries and a beer is ridiculous. Having a celebrity chef's name on this place doesn't mean that it's a great burger.  Add to the fact that he's known for his french and haute cuisine - means he shouldn't know that much about burgers.. . Not bad, but not worth the price.  Even for Vegas.. . I'll be running to the In-N-Out about a mile away instead.
I ordered The Hubert Keller burger medium rare and holy s**#, it was perfectly cooked, moist and full of so much flavor that I can't stop thinking about!  This buffalo burger was my first and will not be my last!
Still a fun place and the food is consistently superior.  Would recommend this place to anyone.  Best hamburgers ever !
Had the froi gras burger(the Bellini). Can scratch it off my list now. The truffles weren't what I expected. Thought it would be freshly sliced, but had a little bit of a rubbery and brine taste. The froi gras was tasty, not much on the burger. Overall It was good but not worth the price. And it doesn't come with desert anymore! And if you're suppose to get a choice of a side one wasn't given to me. It came with the skinny fries. So if you have extra cash try it. If not, don't bother.
Not bad, somewhat memorable. I love the variety of ingredients and "stuff" all over their menu, I am all about adding different things and love access to lots of sauces. I assume that as a tourist trap, the burgers have become what they have for feeding the masses. Reading the descriptions I was very intrigued; upon tasting the burgers, I was not. Not disgusted by any means, but just not impressed. The buffalo meat was delicious though.. . I'd also assume that the fries a place like this offers should be great in one way or another and I found none in both types. . . Overrated is quite the perfect word for this place, just like most of Vegas. Some places are, while being overrated, worth trying just, or at least, once. This place, I found no merit for. Reminds me of an airport restaurant. I'm not mad I tried it, but I wouldn't be recommending anyone to go out of their way to.
My husband and I ate there last night. It was a little rancid smelling-- like when you take out three day old meat from the fridge and ask yourself "can I grill this or throw it out", then the answer always is throw it out.. Well, I ordered wings which were very very small (like Cornish hen size) and my husband ordered a burger as rare as they could serve it... I know, not a good idea. My husband has been vomiting all morning and the hotel room smells like that restaurant smell!! Really gross!! Sorry!! We won't be dining there again. I don't think I can give 0 stars??
Favorite place to get a burger, hands down. Since I am GF, it is a great option to have GF buns.  I typically get the Turkey burger with avocado, tomato, mushrooms and onions.. . The only drawback?  The place is rather small and can get rather crowded.  But, that's a good thing - because it shows how popular it is.
Not only do the burgers range from regular to fancy schmancy, but this is a great casual spot to meet with friends!
Food was delish! We got the sampler with Mac & Cheese Croquettes (boring, tasted like boxed m&c inside), mozz sticks (less than amazing) and poblano poppers (these were actually good, but it's debatable whether it was a poblano inside). I had the Peppercorn Burger and it was fantastic! The scoop of peppercorns was genius! The veggie burger looked fresh and house-made. And the drinks were strong.  But was it appropriate to have employees eating behind the bar? No.
We ended up here late on a Saturday night. This was not our first choice (amazing how many restaurants close at 11pm!) I am super glad we ended up here. The burgers were awesome and since I am not a huge burger lover, I was pleasantly surprised. There are several options for the type of meat you want and I went with the hormone free usda beef. It was extremely flavorful. My husband, who loves a good burger, was also impressed. We would both like to return and try another type of meat. The only negative was the service. It wasn't awful but it definitely could have been better. We were sitting 2ft from the bar but it took forever to get a beer after we ordered and our server was just hanging out at the end of the bar talking with co-workers. That is kind of ridiculous. I would still give it another try though the burger was that good.
I was seriously disappointed by this place on multiple levels. First, the service wasn't great; our server missed a few items we ordered and took a long time to get us drinks or refills, yet her tables of young men seemed to be well taken care of.. . The food was alright and the beer selection was great. I ordered a veggie burger with onion rings. The onion rings were fantastic, but the veggie burger had no flavor. I was excited that this burger place had plenty of vegetarian options on the menu, but this was just gross. Highly disappointing.
Our food was great! I had the Greek burger and really enjoyed it. My only complaint is that sides are ala carte and $4 for 8 onion rings. They tasted delicious, I just don't know that $17 for a burger and 1 side was worth the money. I'd recommend giving it a try. My friend loved her Chicken and Brie burger.
Best burger I have had in Vegas!!! Great food and if you come here and want an alcoholic milkshake then try one!!! I normally get the pink monkey and walk 100 feet and come back for another...it's that delicious!!! Can't go wrong with this place!!!!
Came to the Burger Bar but didn't try a burger, but instead got some delicious finger licking good chicken wings.  The wings looked a lot fancier than what I'm used to but they were wonderful and I loved the fries here as well.  Combined with the sauces, my food was perfect.  Burger Bar is a great and satisfying place to eat, the food itself deserves high praise, but the service downs the overall rating.  The only thing I didn't enjoy too much was that our waiter seemed to take awhile to come make his rounds and especially to come bring us our check.  I don't know if they were understaffed that day for waiters but I wish the service was more on point and attentive.  I can't wait to come back and try the burgers, but dreading thepossibility of subpar service.
I work nearby and have found myself eating here multiply days a week! It's not just burgers, I often get the chicken sandwich, the salmon sandwich or even a salad! There are tons of apps also which are to die for, plus a milkshake bar with adult milkshake options!! They always have fun upbeat music playing and the staff if great. If you haven't yet tried burger bar you have to!
I'm not much of a burger person, so take my review with a grain of salt. My friend really hyped Burger Bar up for me, so I was expecting something amazing. In the end, I realized I prefer In 'n' Out.. . I just got bleu cheese, avocado, and bacon on my burger, and the bacon was crispy and spectacular. As a whole though, it was just okay. Considering we spent more than $50 for two burgers, two orders of fries, and one soda, I was unimpressed.. . I've also tried Burger Brasserie and Gordon Ramsay BURGR, and I found them to both be delicious, unique, and worth the outrageous cost. But Burger Bar just didn't do it for me. I'll give it another shot if someone insists but will never choose this place on my own.
Wandering the mall awaiting a ride after my Luxor stay, I stumbled on this as the best looking option, not too crowded (except for Mr. Charles Barkley who wandered in shortly after I did).  Burgers exorbitantly priced: is it worth it?  For a one time deal probably borderline:  the Kobe beef burger was thick and flavorful, one of the better burgers I have ever had.  But still a burger.
Where else can you get a burger that's made the way you want. If there is another place by all means let me know. You can pick the meat the bun even the type of French fries you want. The milkshakes are great too.
I've been here several times and I like this place a lot. This time though the buffalo burger was just okay. We sat at the bar.. Our server wasn't the friendliest I've ever run across. I'll give this place another chance since I've had so many good experiences here in the past.
I've never had the Kobe burger, only Angus, so I can't judge that (maybe it would blow my mind). But burger bar is good. That's it.....good. It's pretty cheap Vegas-wise, and there have a crazy large beer selection. I like that you can build your own burger, but I don't like how they charge $.75-2 for each item! It's always super busy and I've always had to wait at least 20 minutes.. . If you're staying in Vegas a while, try it, if you only get 2-3 nights then skip!
This is a nice place if you're looking for a different burger. They have lots to choose from.  I had the lamb burger and it was just ok.  No, spicy ketchup does not make it worth $20.00.  Now, the twinkie shake....that's the B O M B!  The staff was nice and polite but the music is way too loud to enjoy a normal conversation.  I'd go back....
The burgers here are pretty good. I've definitely had better. The price is decent for what you get. Customer service was great I didn't run into any problems. I would give this place 3.5 stars if that were possible.
