Before Cut the only Vegas steak places I had been to were Carne Vino (amzing) and Envy (terrible). I came to Vegas to interview for a job and the guy who recruited me took me to Cut for dinner. It was very, very good.. . I ordered two different Bourbon drinks- I think both had ginger- they don't appear to be on the menu anymore but one was similar to the Samurai they serve now. Both were delicious. . . I got a pork belly appetizer- it came with a raspberry sauce on the pork that was incredible- one of the best pork belly dishes I have ever had. . . I alwyas get bone in ribeye and potato side when I go to a new steak place for comparison purposes. The steak here didn't have as much of a crust as I would like but it was seasoned well and the meat was very well cooked. The potato puree was smooth, not lumpy, seasoned well. . . For desert they brought us free baked Alaska because they "like to take care of thier locals"- I wasn't a local yet but with food like this I was well on my way to becoming one. It was excellent- baked Alaska is a personal favorite of mine and this one was very well done. . . Let me say one other thing- the bread. Bread can be a good way to distinguish good restaurants from great and Cut definately nails it. They have a few different types that seem to rotate from what I can tell (pretzel is one of the best) and they bring it around on a cart. You can get whatever you want, as much as you want. This is good- it avoids fights to the death over the last pork belly bread ala Gordon Ramsay Steak. . . I have since been back 3-4 times and enjoyed it thoroughly every time. . . . A general note on Vegas steak - some of the negative reviews of Cut are just ludicrous. They didn't have A1? Well guess what, you are gonna get A1 almost nowhere when it comes to fine dining. The steak came by itself on a plate without any circles painted on the plate or sliced up vegetables constructed like legos into an art piece? ITS A STEAK HOUSE. Seriously, if you have no idea where you are going its not really fair to post a negative review that boils down to "this place wasn't the perfect hybrid of Sizzler and Alinea I was hoping for". Steak places in Vegas are producing a very specific product to compete with a very specific set of restaurants. If you want a cheaper place with A1 why are you going to cut? Similarly if you care about plating why are you going to a steak restaurant? Use your brain.
WOW! This place is the BEST!!! The Service is great and food is so yummy! My man is so sweet to me, to have brought me here.....he really loves me, does not even have to think twice about it. We will defiantly be back.
I brought my fiancee here for our anniversary and we both loved it. He said it was the best steak he's had and we've tried it all. They really do their best to make you feel welcomed and special. I felt like we were eating a friend's home because the hospitality was just that warm. . . The big ol' blown up portrait of Wolfgang Puck at the entrance is egregious though. Yea, he's a celebrity, but it's just tacky.
