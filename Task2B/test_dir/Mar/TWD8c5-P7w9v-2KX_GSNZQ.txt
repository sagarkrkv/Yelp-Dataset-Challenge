For 4 months I've been going back and forth with Mandalay fighting their $43.24 AND $21.01 double charge on my credit card for the in-room Grey Goose bottle (which I NEVER touched) and resort fee, respectively. . . These jerks disputed my claim against them by sending my credit card company a receipt for these charges...um, ok? Like a receipt process anything? . . How about you look at the fact that none of the overpriced drinks and foods in the snack console was ever handled??? (I know that the slightest touch signals the sensors so we just stay away from it completely). Or how about you look at my original purchase and prepaid resort fee from Expedia?. . I HATE YOU MANDALAY BAY, YOU CROOKS! wasting my time trying to get this fixed and STILL trying to resolve (I'm literally on hold with Amex as I type).
Great hotel. The band The Limit that plays there nightly is awesome. All request band and they do an excellent job. Check it out.
Stayed for one night was amazing. Luxury hotel, amazing cuisines, great service the place is giant ! Definitely coming back
I've stayed at Mandalay Bay twice and been to shows, dinner, or gamble several times and it is a solid 4-stars ... a notch below the elite of Vegas and a step above the mediocre. It's large with the full Vegas experience under one roof if you aren't wanting to explore ... with multiple pools, a plethora of restaurants, the Michael Jackson show, other concerts, standard shopping, and, of course, a casino. Resort is a better name for Mandalay Bay than hotel.. . The rooms aren't elite opulence, but they are nice with functional, yet cozy furniture and large bathrooms. If you can afford it, be sure to upgrade to one of the upper floors because the views of the Las Vegas Strip are better from there. Since Mandalay Bay is currently near the South end of the Strip, rooms with a view facing north/east will be the best. The location is also really close to the airport and 15 freeway.. . Overall, Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino is a solid option when visiting Vegas. If you get a good deal on a room or are looking for a one-stop shop for a large group with diverse needs then I definitely recommend Mandalay Bay.
The rooms have to be better cleaned, they are dirty and pillows, comforters and mattress cover are so dirty.
I am not use to staying at hotels in Vegas but if they are all like this it is quite a disappointment for the money that you pay. After we checked in we went to the room and opened the door on someone who hadn't left yet and the room hadn't been cleaned. We went back to the desk and was given another room on a higher floor with a $50 restaurant comp. The room was clean and had a great view but the bed was horrible - way too soft, especially for my husband who kept rolling off the edge - and the bathroom was an echo chamber. There was a window over the bathtub that looked into the entry with seemingly no purpose other than allowing anyone standing on the entry side to see whoever was bathing. The toilet in the bathroom had a separate door but the main bathroom door was a slatted double door that opened to the bed so anything and everything could be heard. There wasn't a coffee maker so you have to either order room service or get dressed and publicly presentable to go get some. I usually like tea in the morning before going for breakfast but this was out.. The resort itself was nice but all but one of the pools were closed which is one of the main highlights. So it was quite difficult to find a place to sit at the one pool that was open. It may also be common in Vegas but it was impossible to find any place that was quiet and relaxing.
I went to a convention last week and went to my room to sleep. I am hearing impaired and listen to my television very load. I stay at Mandalay Bay multiple times per year and have for years. I woke in the morning wondering why my remote was off my bed and back up by the television. In the morning, I received a phone call early and was wondering whom might be calling. They said it was security, I had to put something on and answered the door. I was told that my television was to load and they asked me to turn it down. I said I was sorry and did not realize. The security officer at that time told my this was my second complaint and in the event I received a 3RD they would ask me to leave the hotel. I explained that I was not aware of another complaint and again explained I was hearing impaired. He then told me that they entered my room the night prior to turn off my television. Ladies no notice was left and they went to my bed to remove the remote, when the television was across the room. I had no clothing on and I truly believe this is unacceptable. I went to the manager and then was told that I needed to file a complaint with security and I did. The security officer was helpful and they moved me to the penthouse so no one could hear my television. However, I wanted this addressed and I was told that I would hear from night security later and I never did, but to make me feel better I was told that it was not only one man in my room but two. Thehotel knew I was traveling alone and this should never be able to happen. I like to travel alone and I will tell you this experience has changed the way I feel about being in a room alone and now I lock every door in my home while I am sleeping. This is not how travel should ever make anyone feel in life. I own a real estate firm and manage many properties and I could never enter with out leaving notice and could only enter based on a emergency and I really do not feel that a load television is an emergency.
REVISION MADE AT THE BOTTOM ON HOW THEY MADE IT RIGHT. . Absolute worst experience I have ever had in Vegas.. I was so upset by the managers treatment to me. I am 20 and was in Vegas a little too late to feel safe driving home so I decided to call this hotel since it is where I have stayed with my family every time I went to Vegas. I will never come back or recommend this hotel after the kind of treatment I got. not relaxing at all; a complete utter disaster... :(  . . The story is that I made the reservation at 10 o clock (after Zumanity) because there was a drive back to Saint George I didn't feel safe driving in due to fatigue. . . When I spoke with the representative she said there was a room available and that it would be 270.00 for the night I said that would be fine and she went ahead and asked my billing address and the name for the reservation.. . After she took my information she asked for my card information and I gave all this to her.. . next she told me when the pool etc. closed and that I need to be 21 to check in and that is where I had the problem and told her I was 20. She put me on hold for 15 minutes and then I got with a manager who was a complete power struggle. He stated to me that due to the nature of their policy they can't refund any reservations made without a 48 hour notice and since it is well within that time period he is going to extend a special offer of refunding half the money if I cancel the reservation now or I need a 21 year old to check me in... this was completely disrespectful of my time and money.. he stripped me of any bit of happiness I could have felt. . . I was trying to be responsible and stay off the roads at such a late hour and either way I was paying premium money to stay there. . . ** not to mention I have stayed here before and had no problem even at 19 when I walked in... . At this point in the story I was given the option to get half the money back and have no room or have a 21 year old check me in which both me and my girlfriend didn't have... . why this wasn't explained to me before I gave her my card is completely wrong and for them to offer half my money back for a reservation I was still on the phone for is completely ethically wrong.. . . Both me and my girlfriend rushed off to the hotel to try and figure something out regardless of the fact that we were supposed to have a nice dinner and relax. This took a while to get to the hotel since we had to walk and take the tram etc. . . When we got there we went up to an agent and went through the check in process to see if they would just check us in. We got through just fine even though I handed him both my card and ID.. . The manager seriously ruined our night and gave me anxiety I have never felt before.. . We get to the ruin and are ready to go to sleep after a completely stressful night. ** we are still hungry but sick to the point where we can't eat... . the doorbell rings and ** THE DOOR IS SET TO DO NOT DISTURB. it's the maid and she has a note that says alcohol/food.. . at this point I don't feel like I am ever going to be able to relax because now she is up here and disturbing peace that I played a lot for!!!. . she comes in our room when my girlfriend is in her underwear lying in bed so I am very bugged that we can't relax AT ALL!!. . there is no wet bar in our room so there isn't any alcohol. unless somehow it is in the locked fridge looking thing under the sink... . the maid can't figure it out so in her rightful mind she decides to take all the snack bar type things IE: Fiji water, mom's, pretzels, etc. BASICALLY ANYTHING WE COULD HAVE HAD.. . WOW THIS WAS HORRIBLE. . ***THE SERIOUSLY TOOK MY MONEY AND MY HAPPINES AND RUINED OUR PLANS FOR DINNER FOR NOTHING!!!!!!. . I WILL NEVER SEND ANYONE YOUR WAY OR EVER COME BACK EVEN THOUGH I USED TO LOVE THIS HOTEL.. . YOUR ETHICS HAVE WASHED AWAY!!!. . . **When I called in today to talk to a manager I was offered a pitiful 28 dollar refund to my card WOW!!. . He said since I had stayed in the room that's all he can do.. I would normally understand this but considering my options of if I would have canceled the room and not stayed in it I would have lost almost 150.00 and still not have a room or make it work and find a way to stay whether that is paying someone to check me in at 21 or hopefully when I get there they would just check me in... I didn't have much of a choice... . Something must be done because the stress you have caused is astronomically high and to top that I paid for the stress and anxiety in this case!!. . . **update. . they got back with me over email. . I appreciated their assistance in making this situation right with me! What happened to me was an experience that is rare. I have been many times and loved every time. I will be back considering the fact that they got back to me and corrected their errors. The pool is beautiful and the location is very refreshing!
If you're heading to Vegas (BABY) then this is the place to book.  It has it all - whether you stay in THE Hotel tower or in the main hotel.  The rooms are gorgeous and the location is convenient to the airport. Also, there are complimentary trams to a couple other resorts.  But, if you want to stay in one spot, you've got it all here!. . Vegas Baby!
Just finished a stay here for a work convention. Service was AWEFUL. . Spent 5 hours flying to get here, and was told the hotel had two issues. . 1: The room wasn't ready, it was 4pm. . 2: A room that was suppose to have 2 queen beds had a king and a roll out. Not exactly a great way to sleep after a 5 hour flight. . Hotel staffer was indifferent at best when I asked why the reservation was messed up, we only booked the rooms five years in advance because of a long term contract with the hotel. She couldn't have cared less! . They took my cell and sent me a text when the trim was ready. They also said they would contact me to change out the room if one with 2 beds became available. That was Tuesday, I got the text at 9 pm Thursday night. A little since we were flying back Friday Morning. . If I wasn't forced to stay here for work, never again! Only thing is, we are booked to come here the next 5 years. . Last thing, to add insult to injury, the hotel sent my roommate and I a little basket with 2 bottles of water, some snacks and an apology card for the room mistake, and then hit me with an 11.00 service fee for it. The only competent person I dealt with was the young lady who got rid of the 11.00 charge to the room for the snack basket. I did it over the phone while checking out on route to the airport. Very sorry I got stuck here!     :(
LOVE this place. The  grounds are expansive and lots to do.  If you want information about anything Vegas, ask for Thaddeus at the Concierge Desk. He's the man.
Wow I have never had such a nasty room in Vegas. Dirty room asked to be switched and they moved me into a room with a broken bed. I spent ten minutes sitting in the hallway in between moves. They did nothing to compensate for the hassle. DO NOT STAY HERE. I'll be lucky if I don't get bed bugs. Serious yuck.. Night life is fun here but stay sleep elsewhere.  ZERO STARS!!
Mandalay Bay is a neat casino on the Strip, very large with lots of options, but doesn't have a lot in the way of tables for common games like blackjack. Most of the games are odd variations like Let It Ride and Blackjack Switch, so if that's your cup of tea...go for it. The dealers weren't that engaging though and could use a little bit more skip in their step, but it's not like they were rude or anything. It's a cool place to hang out and is connected by tram to the Excalibur and the Luxor. I did not stay here so this review is strictly for the casino and I have independently reviewed the Crossroads House of Blues restaurant which I highly recommend.
I've stayed at the Mandalay Bay several times and I havent been dissappointed yet.  The rooms are above average and the options for food and entertainment are excellent.  You can eat high end (Aureole) or low brow (Nathans Hot Dogs) go to the beach or see Cirque de Soliel- Michael JacksonsOne or just gamble all night and day. If you cant find something to do here,  you just dont know how to have fun!
I. The Bitchin' (That's a good thing, not like 'bitching' which is something your wife does). . (+) Clean, well kept rooms.. (+) The bathtub is huge, and there's a seperate shower!. (+) Really nice pool.. (+) Casino Lobby is kinda chintzily decorated and themed tropically, but it's still nice to see and unique for the strip.. (+) Tram that goes to Luxor or something, I didn't take it, but it definitely helps out the bad location on the south end of the strip.. . II. The Bitching (Okay, see the difference?). . (-) Frickin' toilet sounds like it's going to explode when you flush it. Freaked me out.. (-) The Buffet @ Mandalay or whatever blows hard ass.. (-) If you self park, you gotta walk across the entire lobby to get to your room, and vice versa.. . Overall, I'd stay here again, especially since I had 2 of my 3 nights comp'd.
This p;ace is just AWESOME.  The smell, the action, the excitement, the food, the POOL!  All there, and reachable by a free tram from Excalibur.  It's, by far, one of the top 3 casinos in Vegas.
Came in for one night this last weekend for a getaway with my bf. We got upgraded to a suite that was 1800sq feet- it was very nice! . Room service is expensive like everything else, and tastes just ok! The pool here is amazing and that is what keeps us coming back. Great for families and for people who want to relax. Love the bar tender Joe out by the wave pool, great personality and friendly. over all great experience!
Great place!  Beach & drinks - what a happy hour, baby!!!  Also great is Fleur (foie gras fanatics) and Boiler Room with great noshes (like potpie bites) and smokey whisky drinks (complete with smoke in glass skulls!).   Mandalay rocks...even it it's a work trip (am here for the Exhibitor Show!).
I've stayed here a few times and always left satisfied. Rooms are nice and modern. Casino is always busy and fun. Sportsbook is great. Tons of big screens, lots of tellers so no big lines. It has great high end restaurants plus some reasonably priced stuff. I prefer the lounges over the clubs. They have 3 main lounges that will satisfy most tastes.  Have seen some great concerts at HOB but lately they haven't had anything worthwhile. Don't know why that is. But they have Mandalay Beach. Pretty cool.
"Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer." -- Jaws (1975). . This may be my new favorite hotel to stay in Vegas.  We weren't in a fancy room by any stretch, but it certainly sufficed.  The biggest drawback was that we were at the very end of a hallway, and at the end of a long night, that walk seemed longer and longer.  Next time I will ask for closer to the elevator.. . The casino is great - spread out, not smoky, the cocktail waitresses are a bit hit or miss, but the good ones are great.  They recognized when service was slow, so they would bring us two drinks to make up for it.  They have great machines that I enjoyed (yay for Organic Craps) and plenty of slot machines for all tastes.. . They have tons of food options for all hours, which certainly comes in handy in Vegas.  Plus the tram to get out and part way up the strip really made it easy to get in and out of the hotel.  With easy access to both the tram and taxi service, I never felt the need to stay at the hotel, but there was plenty to do here that we didn't feel the need to go elsewhere.  They do have the Shark Reef, after all.. . Add in the House of Blues with great concerts, amazing restaurant options and the beach and pools - this is my new go to.. . As for the bathroom in the room - the shower had two settings - scalding hot (which I don't mind) and cold. And when you flushed the toilet, we were convinced it was going to suck one of us in with it - insanely powerful and loud.  Housekeeping took great care of us bringing plenty of extra towels and blankets upon request.. . I do wish we had been able to use the fridge in the room for leftovers from all our meals - but it was the minibar and opening it caused charges.  Boo.. . Still - I'll stay here again.
Good Hotel. The lazy river and wave pool are fun. The views from Mixx and the Foundation Room are awesome. Plenty of bars and restaurants also check out the lounge bar acts - good people watching.
I stayed here 7 or 6 times in the last 14 years, it was such a great hotel to stay in when it first opened and it was more geared towards adults so barely any screaming babies. . . It's still a nice hotel today, check in is always easy for my family, rooms are nice, big bath tub etc but I just feel it has gone down in quality.. . The hotel is connected to Mandalay Bay Place which is just a small shopping center, really nice but it's more high end things. it leads straight to the Luxor so you don't have to go outside if it's blazing hot. . . I always liked the pool area too. The wave pool, lazy river and regular pools give you more of a selection. though, as the years keep going by it seems more and more kids have accidents in the wave pool and lazy river.. . . I'd say the only thing bad is that there aren't many "fast" places to eat. They have buffets and some restaurants with a dress code but there isn't any place in the hotel where you can grab food fast and take it back to your room. I always had to go to the Luxor.
The Mandalay Bay is a very nice place for families and couples but you can see the wear and tear of guests taking it's toll on the rooms etc. The MB seems to have a huge "Conference Customer" component and is setup to take care of large groups easily. Having only stayed here for one day, I really didn't get to use much of the facilities like the extensive pools and nightclubs so I can't comment. I did get a nice, clean room and the staff was friendly although not exceptional in any way. I did enjoy my stay here but I'm not sure if I make a point of coming back. 3 stars.
One of my favorite things about this place is the customer service. Upon arrival we were greeted with a friendly valet attendent and bell man. After that, the registration desk was seriously the fastest I've experienced at a Vegas hotel and I've stayed at a lot of Vegas hotels. They had ample people working the check in desk and the one who helped us was extremely helpful and friendly. We asked about Light and she took down my cell and told me a VIP host will be contacting me. Very shortly I received a text from a host as promised who was also helpful. . . I called guest services many times during my stay for various things and all my interactions were always so pleasant and helpful. The rooms could use a little refreshing but overall they were comfortable. I thought it was a special touch when they would always make a follow up call to ensure that extra towels were delivered or if we needed anything else. . . The resort itself is nicely appointed with pretty much anything you would want to do. From great restaurants to nightlife to shopping you got it here.
