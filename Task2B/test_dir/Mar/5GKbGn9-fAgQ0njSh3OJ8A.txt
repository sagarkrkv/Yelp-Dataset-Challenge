Enjoyed a signature cocktail. Oysters and famous meatball was a must. I love bread but rarely would I mention in a review, but their garlic bread is maybe the best I have had - so evenly crispy but melts in you mouth. Great service and hip vibe.
If you're in Vegas on a Saturday and you don't want to see the sun during the day, come here! The place is AMAZING! You'll forget all of life's problems...WOO! The best part is you get to do so many things you'll regret BEFORE the sun goes down!
Decent service but horrible food! This was the only place we could get in on short notice around 10:30 on a Monday night. The lobster bisque was inedible, the chopped Louie salad was 90% onions, 9% mixed greens and 1% lobster and shrimp and the sea bass was so so. Reasonably priced for Vegas but definitely not somewhere I would recommend. I'm not sure if it was the alcohol I consumed that night or the food at Lavo (probably the food) but it did not sit well and violently came back up the way it went down the next morning. Tmi, sorry.
Free for local ladies (not sure if it's only on certain nights).. Music alternates between hiphop and house. (I wish they played more hiphop/top 40 because I hate house music).. Every hour or so they blast foam bubbles onto the dance floor.. One time when we were there, they gave out free glow sticks to the people on the dance floor.. Dance floor starts to get packed around midnight and there's hardly any room to move around (this was on a Sun when they used to be open on Sun).
LAVO Lounge is a lot of fun and totally worth it if you are looking for a fun experience minus the crazy clubbing! We were lucky enough to sit at a table and the vibe and atmosphere was perfect for a few friends celebrating a birthday. The decor and seating makes you feel like you are in an old library! . . LAVO brunch is NOT WORTH IT! After having a great time the night before, we wanted to continue the celebrations over brunch. After 30 minutes of waiting for a table, we then waited another 30-45mins before we were able to order food! This type of service is understandable if it is crowded, but it was not. There were many open tables. When we brought it up to our waiter, his excuse was "Well the kitchen is on the second floor so we are running up and down stairs". If this is what causes the bad service, then something needs to be fixed! . . Besides the wait, the food was okay. Definitely not the a top choice for brunches in Las Vegas and I don't think I will be back anytime soon.
Our pasta was delicious. Atmosphere was dark and fun (a precursor to a night out at a dance club - DJ and all). Service was prompt and thorough. Only complaint is it was a little cramped. Our table was right between two other parties and it didn't feel very private. Perhaps the darkness and music is to help remedy this.
Went to Lavo for my birthday dinner on Tuesday and it was pretty good. The service is great. The food was great. I ordered the mussels and clams in a salsa verde sauce for my appetizer... Amazing!!!!! For my entree, I had the linguini with mixed seafood and that was okay. It was supposed to be spicy I believe but lacked spice. My bf had the seafood Alfredo and I tasted a little bit of it. He enjoyed it I preferably didn't like the lobster butter sauce they added to it. Just wasn't something my tongue appreciated. Lol I would definitely go back for those clams!!! After I ate, we went up to Tao, the nightclub and we enjoyed that since the atmosphere was "loungy."
Great meal.  Great view.
*** Review for Spring Restaurant week 2014 menu ***. . What a great way to end Restaurant Week!  I had a reservation and asked to be seated on the patio (the Terrace, the occupancy sign says).  The sun was in my face for about 15 minutes before going before going behind Treasure Island.  It was a great evening to sit out and enjoy the outstanding Las Vegas weather.. . I was seated a few seconds when my server, Casey, came and took my drink order.  My iced tea was delivered quickly.  A different server came to take my order.  There was no Restaurant Week menu sheet with my regular menu so she just told me some of the choices.  After making my choices, a runner came by with aluminum foil wrapped garlic bread with a dish of marinara on the side.  Super garlic bread and very good marinara!. . Back to ordering.  For course one, I went with crispy fried calamari.  It came with a side of the same tasty marinara as the garlic bread.  The serving size was huge.  This would definitely be an appetizer to share with one or two other people.  I sent almost half of it back so as not to fill up on calamari but I could have finished the plate.  Lightly breaded and fried lightly, it was very good!. . I chose the penne alla vodka for course two.  It was a good sized serving and it was very good.  I slowly ate the penne enjoying each bite and forcing myself to have more garlic bread.. . For dessert, I opted for the raspberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake was lightly flavored with raspberry--just barely noticeable.  The top was crisp from lightly torching the top like you would a creme brulee.  There were several black cherries on the plate that was a good accompaniment for the cheesecake.. . Service was excellent.  Casey came by often and topped off my iced tea, dishes were removed promptly by bus people, and my check was taken for payment by someone who had not been at my table at all.  It was a case of everyone watching how all the guests were doing.
What a huge dissappointment!  We were looking for a place to have a nice dinner while sitting outside and getting some fresh air.  Although the reviews were mixed, I thought we would try it out anyway, big mistake.  The service was as bad as the food, which was overpriced and either too salty and/or overcooked.  They do know what al dente pasta is, but sauces were bland and way oversalted -- and I love salt.  The chicken marsala -- I thought it was probably what you would expect from the olive garden.  Our server, Donnie, was so phony and clearly more interested in the tables with young women.  You would have thought he was in the club rather than serving in the restaurant.  I would also like to add that the ice water served at the table was HORRIBLE tasting and we had no choice but to order the sparkling and I found myself wondering if this was intentional as I had not had anything that tasted so discusting in the several other area restaurants we had eaten in previous days.  I specifically also asked that the champagne be iced cold -- generally they put it on ice for a few minutes before and I did add that I was very particular about this -- clearly it came right out of the cooler as it was not cold but cool.  The hostesses and some other servers and staff were very friendly and had sincere smiles -- unlike Donnie.  Bottom line, there are too many better restauants nearby to choose from to have to settle for this!
Mediocre food in a trendy atmosphere. Expected a good meal, instead got dry and over salted chicken parm. Waiter never checked with us on how the meal was after it was dropped off by the runner. Manager came over with attitude to inquire on our complaint, but barely acknowledged it. Eat elsewhere, then come for the drinks upstairs.
The Kobe Beef Meatball and their Sangria is a good enough reason to spark my return. . Service was eh. Rude hostesses (we got there 5 minutes after our reservation and were told because of our "tardiness we'd just have to wait). Bartender was also rude. Waiter was great. . But that meatball was lovely.
