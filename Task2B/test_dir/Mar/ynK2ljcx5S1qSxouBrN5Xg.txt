Comfy bed, nice scenic views of the mountains. Rooms are a bit outdated.  Huge con: Walls are very VERY thin.
My wife and I stayed here on Valentines 2014. The beds were good, but sound was too noisy. We can hear people easily in the hallway. Also our room in the new tower had a thin adjoining room door and we could hear the people staying there. (Room 60 on the 12th floor. The doors have too large a gap between the door and the carpet. (I guess to slip notes to people under the door ?) We paid $33 a night to stay there, so I guess you get what you pay for, but I heard the casino part of it pays for everything as people are so dumb to lose all their money that way. We just went to the theater and shopped and did the rides. (^:= But I guess casino is just entertainment, as well, in a way..... . Also our floor was non-smoking, so that was great, but someone in the hotel on a smoking floor caused a fire in their garbage can due to a cigarette or cigar and we all had to evacuate the building at 5am. Got back in the room at 5:45am and I could not sleep, so I went to the hotel gym at 6am and it had lots of people there. lol A basic gym. It could have had a few more machines. . . The pool was closed. Repainting. So I wish they would have told us that when we made the reservations. ugggg. . The staff at the tip top bar were very good and the discount on the rides for staying in the hotel was good as well, but not as good as some online websites.. . The hotel staff maids were perfect. We set do nut disturb signs the 3 nights we were there and they did not go into our room at all! We love that. No reason to have clean sheets every night as it is not environmental. The towels could be larger though...but not the maids fault. We left 5 bucks tip on the pillow when we left.. . We did not use the casinos at all, so hopefully other people will review that part.
The best thing about this hotel is the location, its right between downtown and the strip.. . I got put in one of the older rooms, not yet renovated. It's dark and stuffy. There is no coffee maker in the room and the bathrooms are super small. During my stay the blow dryer blew and there were sparks everywhere.. . The maids dont vacuum unless you ask them to, which I find a bit gross. If you try and call house keeping you'll be on hold for at least 5 minutes. The staff is a hit or miss, some friendly others not so much. . . There's a handful of restaurants through out the hotel, pricier than usual. Its pretty cool to go up to the top of the tower for the view, especially at night. The hotel has some perks even a pool but I would stay somewhere else next tim
It's a no-frills kinda place even though they advertise it to be fancy. I'm in the older room & they're kinda dark with the most itty bitty bathroom. I was really bummed to find out they don't even come with a fridge or a coffee maker. If you want a fridge in your room it's an extra $10 charge a day you have the fridge. When we asked about the coffee maker they said they don't have any but there is a Starbucks in the casino if you want coffee. The Starbucks is hella pricey, more then regular Starbucks & the staff is quite rude. The beds are comfy though. The blow dryer blew up in my hands while staying here. Scared me half to death & when you call down stairs you get put on hold forever! . . The staff is a big hit or miss. Some are extremely rude & others are sweet. The amenities have a HIDDEN CHARGE! This charge lets you use the very outdated, not so nice gym, the pool & wifi. $14 a day per person. . . The location is pretty good, in between downtown Vegas & the strip. The tower views are gorgeous at night & free to go up if you're staying here but it's very pricey once you get up.
We got in early before check in the first clerk name Kayla was a real bitch she had a very nasty attitude and everything I gave her in her hand she threw it to me on the counter. Tried to ask questions about the hotel and she was pissed and was like she will answer them when we come back to check in when a room becomes available before check in. As we was leaving we noticed she had a wonderful attitude with the caucasian guest! What really trouble me is everyone already knew who I was talking about before I even said her name! Why is she still working there?Well when we returned another clerk was there name Ron L. we told him about our bad encounter with Kayla and he apologized and gave a upgrade. He was very nice and answered all our questions he even encouraged us to come back to him anytime if we needed to know anything else. We got to our room which was on the 15th floor tub backed up with something might have been sewage cause the room smelled of shit. Called for assistance each time maintenancetook care of it but housekeeping was the worst had to call to have linen changed and to get towels each time I called I had to wait for ever. I reported all my issues to the manager Megan she apologized and gave me a $50 refund for my troubles.
Das Hotel ist einer der alteren und damit schon etwas abgewohnt. Die Zimmer sind trotzdem sauber und die Betten gut. Man merkt es nur uberall, dass es schon etwas alter ist. . . Was mich sehr gestort hat, waren die 15 $ Resort-Gebuhr, die beim Check-In auf den Buchungspreis aufgeschlagen werden. Wohlgemerkt 15 $ pro Tag, nicht Aufenthalt. Dafur kann man das den Pool und das Fitnessstudio nutzen oder die Shows verbilligt anschauen. . . Was sich lohnt, ist der kostenlose (fur Hotelgaste) Ausblick vom Turm.
I didn't stay here but I did enjoy the sky bar lounge. They have a pretty nice happy hour with drink specials and small plates for $5-8. Love that. If you want to come here for the view skip the $15 ticket to the top and go to the bar. Your pictures might not be as great but the bar has the same 360 view as the deck just with windows. The bar is also dark and sexy.
Well let me tell you. We  have stayed here twice before and had a very nice stay. This time was so different!   We got here no problem with check in. Got a good deal for staying here before. Paid a low price for one night, second night free. When we got to our room...very nice until I smelled smoke. I called the front desk to complain that I specifically asked for a non smoking room and there was an obvious smoke odor. She told me no problem will send someone to spray room to purify smell. That took 1 1/2 hours for someone to do that who was spraying for 5 seconds then leaves. It did help but we could still smell faint odors of smoke. At this point I didn't want them to come back to use an air purifier if the sprays didn't help. Had a great evening with my husband eating out and having fun...here in town to celebrate our 22nd anniversary.  Next morning,  left the room at 10 am, went out for the day, come back @4pm so we could get some rest then get ready to go to the top of the world restaurant and celebrate our anniversary.  We notice the need service sign we put on the door when we left was still there. We walk in and no one has come to clean our room! Very upset at this point.  I call and complain again...seriously  we were gone 6 hours and our room wasn't even cleaned? ???? I feel that is more than enough time for some one to clean up our room. I told them..forget it! Just bring me towels and toiletries...and someone actually came by in 10 minutes. What upsets me the most is that no one showed any care or concern. .they were just so matter of fact. No one said Sorry!!! I ended up canceling our reservation at the top of the world restaurant.  I spoke with Will who was the only one who gave me his name without asking,  offered to give me a later reservation and actually cared! I just said no thanks just need to cancel. I have been to the top of the world restaurant twice before and the staff and food were fabulous!  After all is said and done. ...what matters most is that I'm here in Las Vegas with my best friend and hubby of 22 years....just have to make the best of it. One thing for sure, will never stay at the Stratosphere again!
Did not stay here, we were planning on eating at the top, but it was such a dirty, disgusting rathole I lost my appetite.
I didn't even get a chance to stay here...due to the rude staff and miscommunication on Priceline.com. That's why I am rating it low. But from the other reviews, I was better off at the Circus Circus anyway
Clean rooms that came with a television, comfortable bedding, and free toiletries. Despite what other reviews may read, this hotel doesn't charge "hidden" fees. In fact, all fees are laid our clearly before you book your room (as with any hotel in Las Vegas). And no, there isn't any Wi-Fi unless you pay extra for it, which is fine, because I generally don't come to Las Vegas to surf Facebook. . . As far as entertainment is concerned, this hotel offers the best in Vegas- all of which are located 1,000 feet in the air (a beautiful view by the way). It is absolutely breathtaking a night, and something you must see in-person to really appreciate. There are a few hotel restaurants as well, one which is located on the 104th floor or so. Didn't eat there but me and my girlfriend had a Mango Madness mixed drink, which was AMAZING. . . The staff is super-courteous and professional. Live bands play periodically during certain nights. If you came to play poker then there are probably better options in Las Vegas. Overall, had a really great time here. The only downside is that hotel is located a bit farfrom the strip, but you can easily hop on a shuttle that comes every 20 minutes or so that will drop you off at any one of the larger hotels (Bellagio, Cesar's Palace, etc.)
I was getting married in Vegas. I was getting married in the Chapel in the Clouds at Stratosphere so I decided to stay in the hotel for convenience sake.. . The rooms were inexpensive and clean. I don't have high expectations given the price. The toilets are scary. Don't do a courtesy flush unless you want to risk having your insides sucked out through your bumhole.. . The unlimited tower admission seems like a pretty good perk for staying here.. . The pool was adequate but they really should have built this on the ground floor so that the buildings shield you from the wind.. . Cleaning staff were excellent. They were careful not to bung up or throw out your stuff and they did an overall good job.. . The casino is ok. I wish they opened the tables in the pit near McCall's on more than just the weekends. Younger dealers tend to be more fun to play with. They're also friendlier than some of the old-fogeys running the tables on the other side.. . Wifi access wasn't too bad but I disliked having to re-authenticate every 24 hours.. . The tower shops are kind of a ghost town. Food, like McDonald's, is about the only thing you go there for.. . Like almost every hotel in Vegas, they have the dreaded resort fees. You get charged this whether you use their amenities or not. $15/day for this one.. . Because of the location, you lose most of your savings by taking extra cab rides. If you have a car or don't mind public transportation, then it's not too bad.. . If you're on a bit of a budget, stay here. If you're not, then don't.
Have to say: horrible customer service. If I could give zero stars, I would. Pulled in to valet to check-in for my stay, and the bell hop was just rude. Valet attendant had to ask him to help us with our luggage twice, and each time he just looked over and turned the other way. Finally had to help myself to my luggage and over to the check-in desk. I asked to speak to a manager (Christopher) and he seemed shocked at the experience and promised to look into it. However I was just as shocked he had not offered to waive the resort fees or provide any type of compensation. Strike two on this stay. . . Honestly, if I didn't already know the regular hotels I frequent were soldout, I would've cancelled my reservation all together and stayed somewhere with better customer service.
Das Hotel ist in der Tat schon alter, was dem ganzen aber kein Abbruch tat. Wir hatten ein zwei tolle Zimmer mit Blick auf den Strip und auf die Berge (ob es am 10$ Tip an der Registration lag -man wei es nicht- ). Die Zimmer waren sehr modern mit allem was man braucht. Im Badezimmer hatte man den Staub auf der Ablage wegwischen konnen, aber das war alles was ich zu beanstanden hatte. Fur den Preis somit Perfekt. Ruhig war es auch im Flur und die angestellten steht's freundlich und hilfsbereit. Einen Latecheckout haben wir kostenfrei bekommen konnen. Das Hotel ist zwar ein bissel auerhalb, aber mit dem Auto kein Thema. Ohne Auto auch nicht, da es direkt vor dem Hotel und auf der anderen Straenseite ein Bushaltestelle fur IN und AUS der "City" gibt. . . Zusammengefasst kann ich es nur empfehlen, jederzeit wieder (fur den Preis).
I don't know why everyone gave this place such poor reviews. I just came back from my Vegas trip and had an excellent stay at the Stratosphere. Granted, we stayed in a suite, but I'm sure the regular rooms are just as nice. . . The Tower Suite was affordable, clean, spacious and the bathroom was awesome (2 countertops with mirrors and a jacuzzi shower is a WIN in my book!). The cleaning ladies came every day (despite what other reviews have said), the front desk receptionists were friendly and professional and the view of the Strip from the top is AMAZING (seriously, it's a must-see). . . Obviously, this is at the end of the Strip so you'll have to take a 5 min taxi to get to hotels/casinos in the Planet Hollywood area, but that's the only complaint I had about this place. . . They have a Starbucks inside but if you're looking for a quick, inexpensive dinner, this isn't the place. Check out New York New York instead (they have a much wider selection). Overall, I was a happy camper.
Went the weekend of 3/21/14 Friday and Saturday.. They told me... I was being upgraded it would only be $15-$20 more... which I thought okay not bad.... get there.... the room was on the 7th floor.... and it was just similar to a MOTEL 6... No Upgrades what so ever....     I don't mind... but my Daily Rate was $200/night...which is Super Expensive for a random not upgraded room...also the sink clogged. . . went to the Pool area...... on 8th floor.... it took us...in a Big Long Hallway thru a bunch of rooms...... took us almost 10 minutes to get there........ and no biggie...... . . Will not consider staying here again.... very disappointed.
I got a good deal through orbitz- $155 : Sat/sun & checked out Mon. . Hotel is located on end of strip which I didn't mind since we had our own transportation. I enjoyed being away from the strip chaos and traffic. Friendly customer service was shown upon arriving. Check in took around 30min, room was on floor 11. Big room, with strip view, clean bed linens and towels and comfy bed/pillows.. . Room service was never completed bc we left the "do not disturb" sign but overall the cleanliness of the room and hotel was great. . . Buffet was nasty- 20$ each person. As a vegetarian there was shitty stuff to eat. The pastas, rice, beans, vegetables were low quality. Tasted like canned food. I was upset at the quality and the high price of the food.. . . 14$ resort fee covers unlimited entrance to pool, tower and wifi. It wasn't a problem to me but I see how some ppl can mind this.. . Overall, good place if u r looking for a cheap hotel where u will only care to sleep and see the view, rides.
