I'm glad we settled on this place for buffet. The restaurant is upscale and beautiful. The settings of the food was delicate, well thought of and frankly, very fancy, dainty and proper. I had to fight the urge of lifting my lil pinky everytime I get food from the display area. Lol! . . I tried EVERYTHING! While some was mediocre, these stood out gloriously! Buffet dinner priced at $36.99. Add $10 more and u get unlimited mimosa, champagne, wine and Bloody Mary. . . The BEST : Gelato! Holy gelato. Transported us back to Italy and Nice, France where we had the best gelato in our lives. Yes it's that good. Try it, I dare u. U'll be grinning from ear to ear like we did. Thai tea was my fav, followed by the pistachio, balsamic strawberry, salted peanut butter and Chocolate! I shd have started with this one first coz by the time I tried it, I had to find space in my stuffed tummy. Then again I won't eat anything else if I started with this. They should offer DESSERT ONLY menu. I'll pay to eat them. . . Don't forget to try the CRISPY DUCK, Bone Marrow, juicy Prime Rib, ceviche in shot glass. Be adventurous! The portion is small so u can afford to try everything before u feel sick! Lol! . . BON APETIT!!!
I'm not a big fan of buffets, bit this was probably the best one I have ever been to. We came for Sunday brunch. The selection of food was impressive and I loved all of the single serving pots and bowls the items came in.
shrimps are not fresh! Horrible buffet. I won't come back again. Everything was not as good as I expect.
The food was good but our waiter 'Lisa' was not there when we were seated. My wife and I had to ask the busboys who our waiter was. People were seated behind us got their drinks first.  We dined in on 8/2/13 @7pm in case management is wondering which Lisa was working.
Hands down, the best brunch I have ever had. First of all, $44 for unlimited food, mimosas, champagne and bloody mary's is an unheard of deal in Vegas, especially with food as good as the Wicked Spoon.. . The buffet boasts everything from pulled pork benedict, to sushi, to gnocchi, to mini wedge salads. Not to mention, the dessert section features chocolate covered strawberries, cakes, custards, cobblers, gelato, and just about anything else you can imagine. It's rare in a buffet setting to eat such fantastic food, but the Wicked Spoon blows just about every other buffet I've tried out of the water. . . The service was great, as we were constantly brought refills on our drinks. The Wicked Spoon is a must to anyone who visits Vegas! I know this will definitely be a tradition every time I visit.
It's a Vegas buffet what else can I say. It was $88.00 for two of us on Sunday night. I'm not a huge buffet fan but it was my partners first time in Vegas so we had to go to one. Would I go back? Well yes if they wanna comp me but no if I have to pay. Again, not saying it's bad just saying typical Vegas buffet. Everyone should try it once. I just feel for $88.00 I can get a better meal that's not a buffet.
The food was either to salty or no taste at all....The food needs to be switched up.  I will give them a thumbs up for their desserts. My overall experience here the past few times is that my server was great. But the cashier and the host were not to friendly and the mangers just standing their chit chatting about personal life rather then help seat guest would have been nice.
FANTASTICO! About every food in the food group was here from many parts of the world.. . Me and my man got lucky! We got comped!! Free Buffet say what!!. . We had it around dinner time and it didn't disappoint!!. . The deserts was amazing! I've tasted food I never even had before! Great selection and wonderful layout! It's worth the $$!
Does anyone know how to give no stars? This place must serve the worst buffet on the strip. I don't understand how anyone would like this food.  Originally, we wanted to have the buffet at Caesars, however, the wait was about an hour wait. Thus, wicked spoon was the alternative. They informed us that there was no wait. So great. When the we got there, the place was practically empty. I think everyone went to Caesars. lol. . I have to say that the food was terrible. I figured that i would like something but nothing was to my liking. For example, the crab legs was sliced open for you so that it would be easier to eat, however, by doing so, its prevents freshness. I rather do a little work because crab legs is suppose to be eaten that way. They have very cheap food, such as fried rice, fried chicken, pizza, shrimp cocktail, meat, salads, and the like. Oh, forget about the sushi, they were so disgusting, they must be sitting there the whole day. One can tell by the rice being so dry that it falls off from the roll. I just don't understand how they can serve this stuff.. . The deserts, however, were pretty good but unimaginative. On the bright side i do like their service. But, come on, for a 50 buffet this is such a rip off.
Holy risotto, hands down the best buffet I've ever seen. And I only came here for brunch!! There are a lot of really great buffets in Vegas. Here's what stands out about this one:. . -Risotto. -Spicy mac and cheese. -Smoked salmon benedict. -Wasabi mashed potatoes (wtf?!). -Sweet polenta with pear (I didn't think I would like it. Turns out it's the best thing ever.). -Full dessert bar available at 11am. . Okay, so that last one is probably standard for a Sunday brunch, but it is nevertheless appreciated. The desserts were all so colorful: white chocolate mousse cake, HUGE chocolate-covered strawberries, little shot glasses of cream or what have you, all-you-can-eat gelato, dollops of panna cotta with a tiny hat of glass-like candy... It was like a portal to the next life. If you're good in this life, anyway.. . Wicked Spoon also has all of your standard favorites from any Vegas buffet: tiny buckets of fried chicken, a variety of salads in little bowls, and more meat than you could shake a cutting knife at. The individual portions will get you. They're so cute, you just have to pick one up!. . Contrary to every other buffet, Wicked Spoon had zero items that I felt were the slightest bit off. This place takes zero shortcuts, half-asses absolutely nothing, and not one of their dishes was forgettable. Staff were also very cool: our server (Natalie) cleared dishes at lightning speed and charmed us with stories of buffets past, and the GM (George) came by to make sure we were having the time of our lives. Which we were.. . Come to Vegas and skip this place. You know... if you hate yourself.
Four to five stars for the food but sadly our waitress decided never to come back to our table and four other waitresses we asked for just some orange juice and coffee decided to completely ignore us.  I felt like we were invisible.  The service was soooo bad it was laughable!  Took going up to the front desk to complain just to get something to drink.
Wicked Spoon used to be the go-to place for buffets, but ever since Bacchanal opened, they seemed to have taken a downhill turn. Some of hte classics are still there, like the spicy mac and cheese adn wasabi mashed potato, but other items, such as the beef, bone marrow, and roasted chicken just didnt taste that good anymore. Their dessert selections seems to have also shrunk, so I stuck with the chocolate covered strawberries, which, were pretty good. Wicked Spoon doesn't really stand out amongst Vegas buffets anymore. i'd rather pay a little less to eat at the Seafood Buffet at Rio or even the buffet in Paris, which serves prime rib in the afternoon too!
Not bad...just average though.
Waste $$$ n time, cheap foods, only good services from a waitress.
Went on a Saturday for brunch.  Thought the selection was great, but disappointed in the meats.  Tried the Korean BBQ ribs, NewYork strip roast, pork belly - all were tough, chewy, salty.  Eggs benedict and desserts were awesome.  Might go back again for dinner - not fr brunc
Ate here Friday and Saturday, everything was tasty except the sushi.  The service was friendly, fast water refills, fast plate removals, but the asian cashier was mean and unwelcoming.  The watermelon siracha was innovative, the goat cheese w lavender amazing, and the sphagetti Nero w langoustine out of this world!  Small portions and getting up to get my own food was good for my waistline, thank you wicked spoon for keeping me fit while pigging out!
This place is ok. Service is good. But the food isn't that good. Came here with some friends during afternoon and most of the food are dried out or it has been sitting there for hours already. I like the Wicked juice and cheesecake!!! Most of the desserts look SOOO freakin good ;) but I didn't come here for dessert.
So it was my first time in vegas and I did sooo much research for this trip. When I first came across this buffet I was so excited but I have to say I wanted to give it a 2 1/2 star. I don't know if it was because I had such a high expectations of it but I was completely let down. First off who eats ice cold crab legs. I was so sad about that. Second about 50percent of the food was cold and the desserts was off but hey I made the best of what I had. Anyways wouldn't be recommending this place anytime soon.
I hate writing long reviews so lets make this short and simple.. . I took my dad here for his bday, I had been dying to try this place for the longest time and we finally decided to go. Lunch formy father and I was over $100.00 so I was definitely expecting something great. The food was okay.. nothing really stood out. The way that the food was set out and the way they plate everything was very nice. The food looks delicious and looks like it would taste fantastic. However, it doesnt taste fantastic, it tastes okay. The Buffet was not bad , but for the price it definitely was not worth it. Since I am a Las Vegas local, I would have preferred to have saved my $100.00 go to a Station Casino and spend a lot less and have money left over for a movie, etc., etc., Dont think ill be back.
As buffets go, this is one of the best. They had some buffet staples, but they had some original dishes. Very large variety and high quality ingredients. If you are more discriminating and want a buffet, this is the ticket. Tried Bachanal, it's fine but WS is might fine.
Definitely one of the fancier buffets I have attended. . Came here for Brunch on a Saturday, paid about 36 bucks a person. If you want some bottomless alcohol like a mimosa, it'll be about 10 bucks extra. . . I will say that Wicked Spoon is one of the tastier ones, with the amount of options, being offered, there is definitely something there for everyone! . . Wait wasn't too bad for brunch, my friends (party of 6) and I were probably in line for about 15 minutes, paid and were seated in another 10! Which definitely was pretty nice since buffets can take quite a long time to just pay! Will say that this is the first time I have seen eggs benedict options both a salmon and beef option anywhere let alone in a buffet. Was extremely delicious! If you're really looking for your money's worth, definitely try to get to the carving station with all the selected meats to try, the options of beef, pork loin, sausages and more! All selections were prepared nicely and were not dry! . . Favorite part of this place will be hands down their desserts, having a large amount of options to try and a gelato station with numerous options to try! My friend practically tried each flavor!
Let me just preface my review by saying that I don't like buffets. I believe that it is an experience meant for mass-consumption of an unhealthy amount of food that is never truly spectacular and provides for a lackluster experience that is meant only to fill your stomach. That being said, I was won over by Wicked Spoon. It featured food in new and creative ways while preserving quality over quantity. Needless to say, it wasn't the most remarkable dining experience you will ever have, however it will make you think "did I really just go to a buffet?". . Set in the recesses of the Cosmopolitan resort, getting there can be a challenge in itself. Whoever designed Las Vegas resorts to get you to set destinations clearly set a slot machine or a poker table in your way. Be prepared with some comfortable shoes, because no matter where you park your car or if you valet, the trek is clearly enough to burn off your first plate of food (I'm exaggerating here for the record). Yet if that isn't enough to deter you, the line to pay followed up by the line to be seated might be. Don't give up. . . When you finally are seated, you are greeted by a diorama of epicurean treats that are hard to be rivaled. From the lighter fare to the more delectable treats, our brunch buffet was among the best I ever had. The smaller plates encourage variety and expanding your taste palate with bites uncommon to the normal buffet. Forget the mass produced scrambled eggs, the cold pancakes and such. Bring on the mushroom risotto with truffle oil, thick cut slow roasted bacon, or perhaps the desire for the gelato bar might arise. . . The smoked salmon mousse in a cone could be passed up, the watermelon with feta and balsamic reduction right next door shouldn't be passed up. While simple, the crisp flavor of the watermelon is complemented with the salty feta and the sweet tart of the vinegar. While it might be over in a bite, I guarantee you will be back for a couple more of them. The bacon was heaven. Not too fatty or oily, but still offering the silky saltiness to go with your made to order omelet. . . Be sure to save room for dessert because the gelato was extremely well done along with the other small morsels set away enough to avoid the drool that will escape your mouth. . . Service was good. Who would have thought I would be talking about service at a buffet!? Yet here I am including the fact that the staff quickly cleared plates, were incredibly pleasant, and never let the water glasses go full. Service usually is tolerable at a normal buffet, Wicked Spoon clearly takes it up a notch.. . While the buffet has become an integral part of Las Vegas cuisine, don't skimp on the $9.99 buffet that might dote the landscape. Let the wallet be a little loose and skip the slots for an hour and check out the Wicked Spoon. It is definitely worth the experience.
Well I may be a rookie to Vegas but i know good food when I see and taste it. I have not been to every buffet on the Vegas Strip and so maybe there is a buffet to end all buffets somewhere out there. But until that buffet stands up and raises it hand I will go on believing that Wicked Spoon has the best brunch buffet on The Vegas Strip. And this may be one of those things that is debated by Vegas scholars and elders until the end of time. Maybe this will be the next food show on Food Network: Finding Vegas's Best Buffet. But until somebody proves me wrong from start to finish Wicked Spoon has to be the best brunch buffet on The Vegas Strip. I mean every morsel of food I ate was better that previous. From the salad bar that offered fresh cut meats and cheese, to the grilled Brussel Sprout salad, and the fresh bagel and lox. The you move to the breakfast offerings, from Eggs Benedict, to chicken apple sausage, and a build it yourself omelette station. Then meats upon meats from crispy chicken wings, to jalapeno sausage, pork loin and  the melt in your mouth pork belly. Then we move to the freshly made pizza, Wicked Mac n Cheese, and the amazing risotto. The once you have moved completely down the expansive buffet with more food upscale restaurant quality food than I could possibly ever list. You must save room for dessert because this may be one of the best dessert bars I have ever seen. Whether it be decedent puddings and pastries or the amazing gelato and sorbet. Then the great cookies and cakes. . . There is very little about this buffet that is not absolutely spectacular. Almost every single morsel of food in simply delectable. On every future visit to Vegas I will make sure to stop into Wicked Spoon and enjoy the hell out of this buffet. So like I said before if their is a better buffet in Vegas I would love to hear about it because I'm sure they are few and far between.
Heard alot of good things about the place so stopped by on a Saturday for lunch.. . Definitely one of the "higher quality" buffets on the strip.. $35 for lunch was a bit steep but the ambiance and the presentation of food was great.. . They had everything from Korean BBQ, Bone marrow, Kale Salads, pizza, eggs benedict, and home cured bacon. :). . The selection of food was excellent although the meats that we tried were all a bit on the salty side.... The Kale salad, congi, and eggs benedict were my favorite things of the things I tried.. . The dessert bar had a very wide selection as well and the portions were small enough where you could grab a few different things without having to worry about not finishing. The icecream and the dark chocolate mouse were my favorite desserts.. . So if you have a big appetite and want to try a lot of different things, this would be a great place to try @ the Cosmo. The next time I go it will probably be for dinner though. Too much $$ for lunch.. . Good to take coworkers, friends, customers, family, and a date.
Wicked Spoon was my first Vegas buffet experience! And I'm really glad it was! I was here on a trip with my girlfriends and we all had a great time. Our server was great and always on top of keeping our drinks filled and clearing away our empty plates. . . I'm usually wary of buffets and proceed with caution because food is just made in a huge bulk quantity--- usually lacking in seasoning and all of that. But I was pleasantly surprised by the variety, taste, and creativity of the dishes. We got there around 11am and started with breakfast foods. Smoked salmon eggs benedict was on point. Then we wandered into lunch territory. I loved their fried chicken (they are served in cute mini fryers too), gnocchi, kale/quinoa salad (yay for healthy options!), risotto...basically I liked everything I tasted. They also had some not so normal dishes such as sriracha infused watermelon (interesting! but only worth one try) and goat cheese panacotta (kind of odd..). I love the idea of combining unexpected flavors so seeing dishes like that made me very happy :). . They also had some great freshly made juice concoctions (I'm assuming they were freshly made) like pineapple, mango, and melon juice.. . Then we moved into dessert!!! Obviously every review here raves about the dessert and it's true...the dessert selection is awesome. I tried some of the pastries but mainly went straight for the gelato! Straciatella is always my favorite, and it was great here:). . At the end of the day, we ended up staying here for 4 hours just hanging out and eating. I think they let us do that since it wasn't a super busy weekend but props to them for not kicking us out. Will definitely be back here the next time I want a buffet on the strip!
I LOVE Wicked Spoon.  I think this buffet is better then the buffet at the Wynn or Bellagio.  Both are wayyyy over priced and over rated.  I try to go to this buffet everytime I visit Vegas!!!
Great buffet! I hate going to a buffet and having a wide variety of food...all of which are nasty. . . This buffet had many great choices! It wasn't particularly all five star food but it was yummy and having so many options to choose from is always a feature I enjoy. There were also a lot of dishes that the chefs could make fresh for you here and did I mention the all-you-can-eat macarons?! The food was definitely pretty darn good as well as the desserts.
It's pretty dead right now but they do pick up after 7. I thought this place was okay, I actually enjoyed the buffet at ARIA more. The selection was really nice, but I just wasn't wowed. The service was wonderful and that alone made it all worth it.  . . I'm not really trying to insult this place, I guess if I were a seafood person, I would be in heaven. I guess I was just expecting more variety.
With the exception of Caesar's Bacchanal, I've tried every buffet on the strip and this one is still my favorite, food-wise.  (In terms of interior design, I've got to hand it to the Wynn).  Lots of choices, everything tastes great, and I love how they offer a number of original dishes you wouldn't normally see at a buffet.  The only downside is where it's located in the hotel.  It's set off in an abandoned corner, far from the casino end of things.  Kind of weird but still worth the trek.
Best buffet I have ever been too, hands down! The food was simply amazing, overall quality of food and the presentation were superb. . . Only caveat is finding a time when they are not so busy - we stood in line drooling for  little over an hour but the experience was well worth the wait! (Little trick to cut down the wait time is to send one person to wait in line to buy the brunch ticket while another person waits in the line to get seated) . . I will come back next time I'm in Vegas!
The concierge at my hotel hight recommended the Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan.  I went with a group of co-workers on a Thursday night about 6:30 and there was no line, we just walked in.  I was not prepared for this place. . . This is one of the best buffets I've ever had.  Some of the buffet items were the most exotic I've ever seen which included duck, Korean BBQ, sushi, prime rib, bone marrow, pea risotto, custom made Mac-n-cheese, gelato, and the list goes on and on.. . Most items were served in small single servings which helped me control portions and go back for a second and third round of servings.  . . The food was fresh, service was excellent, the buffet and restrooms clean, and overall ambiance elegant and comfortable.  All of this for a $44 charge including tax is making me move this to the top of my Vegas "must do" list. Cheers and enjoy!!
I came in at about 2:30ish, no line so that was a plus. Disappointed in the selection of the food (very little for a buffet) but everything tasted great! I guess we came in at the wrong time because I was very disappointed after reading such good reviews. Not worth the money. ):
Have lived here for 15 years and have had great food and not so great food and will have to say that this is one of the worst buffets in this town. The general quality of the food was a zero; desserts were very well done and I am not a dessert person; service staff were excellent. Many selections were gone no matter how many attempts to see if they had been replenished. Standouts were the ribs and pork belly. . Hot sauce on a piece of watermelon not so gourmet !!!. It's not about the price; don't care about that; it's about the quality and this just doesn't have it.. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else !!!
We don't go to Vegas very often, but when we do, we hit up the buffets! We usually do the $40 wristband unlimited buffet in the Paris hotel, but we decided to branch out of the "buffet group" (Rio, Paris, Planet Hollywood). We yelped brunch buffets, and Wicked Spoon had the highest rating. . . We got here around 11:30 AM on a Saturday and waited 20 minutes, which means we must have just doges the lunch rush. The service was EXCELLENT. We got the $10 unlimited mimosas (what a deal!) and Kyle, our server, was more than attentive. Every time our glass was empty, Kyle comes along with another mimosa. . . The price or the buffet was $36, but absolutely worth it. All the food comes in individual portions, fresh, and the food does not run low. Oh, and the desert bar is to die for. . . I am not sure why this place got some bad reviews, but it has met all expectations come in and more. We will definitely be back. Thanks Cosmopolitan and Kyle!
Food is really salty.. kinda taste like they put msg in everything but good service and good variety of foods
We went to the Wicked Spoon on our last morning before heading to the airport and I'm so glad we didn't miss it! Literally all of my favorite foods were in the same room! The brunch assortment included eggs Benedict, smoked salmon, gelato, and sushi. And it was really affordable - if you go during the week it's $26 and you can add bottomless Bloody Marys or mimosas for an extra ten. A must try!
How is the rating so high? . . The food is mediocre at best.  They didn't specialize in anything, and the multinational section all sucked pretty bad. They had Chinese selection, but what in the world is kungpao cauliflower? We don't have that dish. Also Korean rice noodles and BBQ ribs? Nasty.. Sushi? Machine made rice w/ nasty farmed salmon with color additives.  . . Sorry,  but ain't good when there's no line.  Also if it was that good,  you wouldn't need to give 2 for 1 advertisement on a United flight.
Went here for brunch on a Saturday, it was meh. Food was okay, drinks were always full. I wish I could give 3.5 stars instead of 3. . . The bad: not much variety. Braised beef Benedict had great presentation, but very dry meat. the Korean short ribs were salty (from what my friends told me, I didn't try.) the carrot cake fell apart, and the garlic bread was incredible dry. . . The good: plenty of options for desert, sorbet and gelato anyone?! The wicked pizza was delicious as was the fried chicken. and the waitress always made sure our mimosas and bloody Mary's didn't run dry.  The drinks are the reason I wish I could give 3.5 stars. . . Overall? I probably won't come back.
everything was salty, seafood offering sparse.  I like bacchanal 100 times better and I'm a die hard cosmopolitan fan.
Mac N Cheese Bar, a multitude of gelato flavors...need I say more?! Definitely one of the better buffet experiences I've had in Vegas; wicked spoon did not disappoint. It was impossible for me to try everything they offered, but of the things I did try, I was quite impressed. My favorite thing was probably the entire salad bar. There was this pimento cheese thing with a little mandarin slice, and some candied piece added to it that was DELICIOUS. I would stay away from the Asian food seeing as the 3 choices of sushi was definitely the quality of buffet sushi, and the rest of the selections weren't that great. Everything else was YUM. Dessert was awesome too; try the thai tea ice cream!
Went on a wednesday morning about 9:00 a.m and walked right in with no wait.  Server was most attentive (considering it is a buffet) and kept our drinks fresh.. The selections were "crazy good" but requires a GPS device to locate specific items. My strategy was to graze on interesting selections rather than search for traditional breakfast items.  After all, why would one settle for the usual when so many unique selections are available. Between my son, my wife, and me, we must have tried well over 25 items. The food was outstanding and because it was prepared in individual servings, the sanitation factor was superior to traditional buffet food troughs.. Although we did go for breakfast, a great deal of their selections could serve as lunch or dinner, depending on your biorythmic status. This is a Vegas "must do".
So of course being in Vegas one the most important things to do is check out their infamous buffet selections! Even though i have been to wicked spoon a few times before i actually have not had their breakfast selections and i have to say it is just as good as their lunch! The selection they have is superb! And satisfied all my needs! I was able to make my own lox bagel which is super cool because i love lox bagels! :) The Chinese food portion was not too great but the fried rice and sushi was on point. But the best part would be their bakery/dessert section! they have so many items to choose from and my favorite would have to be the croissant section because they have cheese, chocolate and regular which are all my favs. So its pretty easy to say I'm def. coming back for breakfast when my next trip comes along haha.
3.5 rounded down.. . I went to the Bacchanal first,  and the Wicked Spoon is no Bacchanal, but still quite good compared to most hotels around town (Did you know the one near the entrance of the Rio is actually quite good?). . . They have a decent selection of food - I actually really like their cheese selection and salad bar. There's even a make-your-own-macaroni section, and the dessert gelatos are more eccentric than other places. Also, the service was nice - the waitress was actually friendly, which is rare to encounter at any buffet.. . I don't really remember the price tag, but it's cheaper than Bacchanal.
I consider myself a seasoned Vegas-goer, thus I have tried my fair share of buffets. There are only two I even dared to remember and this is one. The selection was so diverse, yet everything seemed to be made with same level of care and attention. Unlike some buffets, the staff was noticeable and helpful. There were people rotating the food to make sure it stayed fresh, discarding of items that may have aged or appeared unacceptable. And for brunch... the mimosas are quite powerful. At one point, our host brought us a glass of straight champagne because she said our mimosas were too watered down. I will make this buffet a regular stop on my Vegas adventures!
Wicked Spoon, Aria and The M are my favorite buffets in town.  Top quality of food without all of the salt and fillers.  Wicked Spoon takes it up a notch with the variety of items on the buffet. SO good, either breakfast, brunch or dinner!
Arrived in Vegas, Saturday afternoon and everyone in my party was famished.  My BFF says lets try the buffet at the Cosmopolitan, I heard it was really good. TRUTH! . . We all know most buffets are gross unless you spend an arm and two legs.  This one was different, they had lots to choose from and they were constantly cycling in fresh food. My group came on the last leg of brunch so we were able to have the brunch and dinner menu.. . What I really liked is that most of the food was already portioned out in cute little container and/or plates.  In my opinion that cuts down on wastefulness and it made the presentation that much better.  If you're going to be in Vegas with a group of friends, I highly recommend.
Ive been here tons of times and my favorites are the salads, seafod paella, and desserts.  The food is pretty good overall, not like your typical buffet.  The chinese dishes are a bit underwhelming but their miso glazed chen is actually pretty good.   They serve some of their food in tiny pots which make it look more appetizing.   For breakfast, I really like the omlet  station, the cheeses, house granola (very crispy), the apple cobbler, and their sausages.
This has been my favorite buffet since they opened. This time I have to say was the worst buffet I've gone to. We went around 1:30 pm on a Sunday. It was $34.00 a person and that didn't come with any cocktails. I walked up and down the buffet twice and couldn't find one thing I liked. I opted for some beets, tomatoes and a slice of bread. The next time I went through I got a piece of top sirloin that was so tough I couldn't eat it. I was telling my son that I couldn't find anything I liked. He agreed. Finally around 2:00 I went back one last time. Low and behold there was several things on the buffet that weren't there originally. My suggestion would be to go before noon or wait until after 2:00. That must be a transition period. Also the service was awful. We had plateson our table that they didn't pick up. Got our drinks and they were the wrong ones. I had to grab a busboy to get the correct ones. For $76.00 I could have gotten a lot more somewhere else. I'm truly disappointed that they have let their buffet slide. I stay at The Cosmo and it's easy to get to. But don't think I will be back.
Came here on a Friday night, $41 + tax. I didn't think it was worth it. I was disappointed in the selection of food and the stale rubbery tasting desserts! Was it because it was 9pm and they closed at 10pm? Regardless, it shouldn't have mattered! . There were a few little things I enjoyed. The octopus poke, the shrimp with polenta, and the garlic mashed potatoes. The lamb ribs (I think it was) was also pretty good. I found most of their items very greasy n oily. Their Chinese fried rice was gross n greasy.  Yes, some of the packaging was cute, like the Chinese type mini take-out boxes, but the food inside of that box was unimpressive.  Salad section was just ok, they had a kale salad that wasn't bad. The New England clam chowder was not good to me. The paella was just ok. It had shrimp, mussels and sausage in it. They also had duck with a hoisin sauce on the side which wasn't too bad. I just didn't find anything so amazing that I wanted to go back for more of it. Tried the black squid ink pasta. Not bad but the pasta tastes overcooked a bit. The bone marrow? I was Soo excited to try this but after looking at it and trying it, was gross fatty tasting and unflavorful. If I'm going to eat that much fat, it better be flavorful! . Desserts. There was a huge selection of dessert and I tried ALL of it!! The only thing worthwhile? The chocolate molten cake! Oh and the apple cobbler. Everything else was rubbery and cakes n cupcakes were not moist! They did not have any fruitthere which I thought was odd. . All in all, I was quite disappointed. I prefer the Bellagio and Wynn buffets over this one.  Guess now I won't have to wonder about the Wicked Spoon any longer!
Adding another 4 star review.   It is fantastic.   The endless mimosas and bloody mary's were a big win although I didn't like the fact that you had to pay at the table for them instead of when checking in.   United Airlines had a nifty 2-1 buffet.   This is a steal for 2-1.   Go there!!!
What a rip off. For over $50 a person you would expect the buffet to have an amazing selection of food. But the only thing with any flavor was the Nutella gelato (which was truly the best I've ever had). The hostesses upfront were rude and the drink and table service wasn't anything special. From the crab legs (which as the worst) to the dry ribs....nothing made our time or money at the wicked spoon worth our while.
I honestly can't remember the last time I ate at a Vegas Buffet but I will remember Wicked Spoon.. .  After a few days of eating nothing but liquor I was in some serious need of food. I had heard a lot of good things so I trusted my friends and they didn't lead me astray. . . The price seemed reasonable for what they offer. There's a great variety and I really appreciate that a lot of the options are portioned out for you. I might have a slight problem with having eyes that are larger than my stomach, so having things pre portioned helped me to try more of what was offered. Everything we had was great and there were some pretty creative dishes. There's also a gelato bar. You can't be mad at that.
Finally got the chance to eat at a Vegas buffet after all this time. It was a hard decision between Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal but since we were on a tight budget, my bf and I decided to eat at Wicked Spoon (weekend brunch-$34 / weekend dinner-$41).. . FOOD:. . Amazingly orgasmic. I can see why Wicked Spoon is so popular. I started on the left with salad, ceviche, salmon with butternut squash puree, risotto and gnocchi. DELICIOUS. I also tried their sushi with a skeptical mind but to my surprise, the quality of their nigiri was very good! They might have added too much rice but the fish was perfect. The desserts were also great with an exception to a few. I have a big sweet tooth so even with the big selection they had, I wish there were more. :-p my favorites were the passion fruit macaron, Thai tea ice cream, and the lemon meringue tart. . . SERVICE:. . Our waiter was really nice and professional. He would come around with our drinks and was very prompt with extra utensils. . . INTERIOR:. . Beautiful. Gorgeous. Stunning. They have these big spiral decorations hanging down from the ceiling, modern paintings and digital artwork hanging on the walls, and a very classy ambience. :-) . . I'd definitely come back but I'd try Bacchanal next time to see if it really is better.
Go.. . We won a little bit of money gambling on Saturday night, so we decided to splurge a little on brunch.  Maybe it was better because it was "free", but everything was amazing.. . Don't be intimidated by the line - it really does move quickly.  The decor is absolutely beautiful and I was really tempted to sneak out with some of the artwork!  Service was also fantastic, especially for a buffet.  My coffee cup was always full and there are always fresh bottles of water on the table - essential for a hangover brunch.. . I don't even know where to start with the food.  I resisted the temptation to start at the dessert buffet and I may still be slightly regretting that decision because I have no self control and barely had room for dessert.  The variety and creativity in the food really blew me away - lots of asian fusion options, mac & cheese with just a little spice, sushi, kale salad, lots of benedicts and endless bacon and sausage... I could go on but you should really just go experience it for yourself.  . . Can't wait to come visit you again, Wicked Spoon!
Love the Cosmopolitan so much! My husband loves Wicked Spoon for the Brunch a lot & the chocolate covered strawberries are his favorite dessert in Vegas! The pizza is awesome & the Asian inspired entrees Re really wonderful! Great service always is found here, and the hot tea & coffee help to revive me when we stay here! The French toast, eggs Benedict , and applewood bacon are the best! Great value here!
I didn't know buffets can be so sophisticated! I guess for the price ($38/person) on a weeknight for dinner you shouldn't expect anything less. The venue is super nice, it's the Cosmopolitan, so of course it will be fancy and over the top! The restaurant is tucked away on the 2nd floor in the corner but once you get inside it is quite impressive.  Service is great, and the food selection is like no other.. I started with the caprese and papaya salad which was very flavorful. I had two servings of the shrimp paella, big jumbo shrimps and mussels that were drenched with flavor.  Another favorite dish I had was the gnocchi; I like how they serve some of the food in separate mini pots to keep the flavor locked in. Then I had to try the Indian food with the curry rice (yum!) and tandoori chicken both were delicious. Also had a plate full of the snow crab and marinated mussels. What can I say, a lot of different selections and it was hard to make up my mind and before I knew it I was full. . Of course, left room for desserts, unique chocolate covered strawberries dipped in heath bar crunch and oreo cookie crumbs. I didn't care too much for these however, the mango macaroons were to die for! They seriously melted in my mouth! I would say this buffet is at the top of my list for buffets in Vegas and I would definitely return. If you are a seafood lover, this is the spot!
Great place for brunch buffet!! This place is very high end. I loved breakfast, lunch and desert.
Wicked Spoon is .... well ... wicked!!!! Meaning Wicked Good and Wicked Temptation!  I saw this place on a random Travel Channel show and put this on a my "Must Go To' List while in Vegas.  Pricing was $38 for weekday dinner and kicking myself for not using the 2 for 1 coupon that I got on the plane.. . Decor was stunning and service was great.  . . The presentation was beautiful with many of the dishes coming in their own little bowls, plates or silver pans.  Having limited capacity on one's plate helped to slow down the buffet mania so often experienced in casino buffets.  I think the objective of the chefs was to allow the patron to sample many dishes without over-gorging.. . My absolute favorite was the bone marrow .... served with thinly sliced french bread and coarse sea salt.  I have never seen this dish on a buffet before and it was delicious!!!!. . Other items of note:. -  Prime rib YUM!  You could get it sliced or on the bone. -  Handmade sausage. -  Barbecued shrimp with grits. -  Mac and cheese bar . -  Beet salad. -  Duck wings. -  Korean dokboki. -  Ceviche. -  Snow crab clusters. -  Shrimp shrimp shrimp - whether cocktail or peel your own. -  Too many to list. . I never thought I would give a buffet a 5 star rating, but Wicked Spoon exceeded my expectations ... and my expectations were high!
Lovelovelove Wicked Spoon! Probably one of my favorite buffets in Vegas. I went for brunch on a Wednesday & their was no wait at all. . Everything looked so creative & tasted so good! There was everything from Japanese food to Chinese food to American breakfast with a slight twist. My favorite thing had to be the dessert selection though. The chocolate covered strawberries were HUGE! I think I tried almost all the gelato flavors they had & they were all delicious! I recommend the Thai tea & Nutella! Soooo good, you'll love it!. It's on the pricier side, but you should at least try it once. :)
Everybody who comes to LV at least ones a year are so used to eating buffet, this i would say is a good mive up to buffet restaurant...it feels a bit more fine dining since the a lot of the food are already plated but not seating in the tray long that they either get cold or dry up...the atmospere was not hurried up so you feel like you need to leave soon so they can serve other guests...if you want to feel the future tone of Las Vegas, try to slow down life in this restaurant...
Service:. . Waitress was very friendly and efficient at refilling our drinks and picking up plates.. . Decor:. . Very trendy and upscale. Loved it!. . Food:. Delicious! My faves were probably the Shepard's pie, tandoori chicken, and creamy spinach! . The meat had a lot of fat on them, which was unavoidable to eat at times... Gross (in my opinion..not a fatty lover). Lots of choice for dessert! . . Price:. 38$ per person for dinner is pretty reasonable, but probably won't be going back again.. . Overall great experience and would recommend checking it out!
Bummer! So I've been having a hard time deciding if Bacchanal buffet at Caeser's or this buffet was the winner... It seems like each time I go to either one, it's just too hard to decide!. . Anyways, based on my most recent experience here, I've come to the conclusion that this buffet is very good still... but Bacchanal buffet is the clear winner. I've been here numerous times... at least 5 or 6... and it seems like it was never as good as it was when I first tried it. Now, that may have been because it was all new and the concept of how they served things was new in the buffet world... but now that more places are doing the same thing - those individual sized servings, the food here seems to have gone down in quality. . . The last time I went was the last time I went to Vegas, just this past January. The food selection is not as vast as Caeser's... and unfortunately, some of the food I had was not as hot or fresh as it should have been. I think part of that problem is that a lot of hungry customers have been venturing out to other buffets and so the turnover of food as not what it used to be and so the food sits out longer... Don't get me wrong, much of the food here still tastes very good... but it didn't have quite the wow factor of Caeser's. The prime rib here was very yummy though. Very juicy and tender!. . The good thing here is that the prices are much better than at Caeser. It's less than $40 for dinner compared to over $50 at Bacchanal over at Caeser's. The place is still very clean and the decor is very nice. I've always have nice servers that are attentive and work hard. It seems like they have thrown out lunch here altogether and it's either brunch or dinner. They do have a 2 hour period here between the meals which is apparently their "happy hour". I have never gone to that, so I do not know what that means for a buffet... unfortunately, it seems like you cannot go here for lunch in hopes of getting dinner food instead because of this "happy hour".
THE ABSOLUTE BEST BUFFET IN LAS VEGAS, HANDS DOWN!!!. . Come for brunch (make sure you get there at least by 1 p.m., because they close at 2 p.m.). It's around $25, which surprisingly is cheaper than most Vegas buffets of much lower quality.. . The selection of food is ridiculous, everything from breakfast to short ribs to sushi to fried chicken, just everything. And their desserts are unbelievable! One of my favorites that I've seen there a couple times is a Chocolate Molten Cake. They also have a section with about 15 different Gelatos to choose from, including a Nutella flavor.. . Besides the food, another reason why Wicked Spoon is the best is because the majority of the food is in individual serving dishes. It's not like most buffets where you have to scoop up what you want out of a huge serving platter, which is disgusting because you have so many people coming into contact with what you're about to eat.. . I can't say enough great things about Wicked Spoon, a MUST when in Vegas.
Very good buffet but expected more given the hype.  Maybe because we were there during lunch. Will try dinner next time.
What am amazing buffet!  I love how they serve individual plates enough to sample.  The food was delicious!  I definitely recommend.  Spacious. My favorites: prime rib,  octopus poke, ceviche,  and dessert

Very eclectic food variety and very, very good.  The waitress was delightful.  Highly recommend if you are looking for a contemporary buffet on the strip.
The wicked spoon really impressed me with their creative salad and appetizer sections. I came here for Sunday brunch and they had a very nice selection of foods. Too many to list here. . . Some highlights of the meal: the bacon was super crispy and delicious. Asparagus salad and the artichoke salad were perfect. The squid ink pasta was amazing. The sweet polenta was delicious. The dessert selection was pretty good but limited since it was the brunch selection with a lot of pastries.
This was a fun evening.  The buffet service is laid out well and accessible  even when it was busy.  The choices and variety were excellent and the quality of food was better than other high-end buffets in vegas.  As a vegan, there are usually not many options, but there were quite a few.  The service was satisfactory; our plates were removed quickly, but we had trouble getting our drinks refilled.  The restaurant is comfortable and surprisingly casual, I even saw people in athletic clothing (maybe elastic waist bands are a good option).  The variety of food made it fun to explore different offerings with friends.
I had read the reviews for this buffet on our way to Vegas and when we arrived we had a buy one get one free coupon so my daughter and I decided to check it out.  I must say we were a little more at the end of the breakfast time but there was still plenty of breakfast items to choose.  They were changing to lunch as we were picking our food.  I became annoyed when I was picking some cantelope from a tray and before I was done the tray was swiped away from me leaving me with tongs and an empty space.  What we did have was okay, nothing spectacular; our server was quick and friendly.  I wouldn't plan on doing this again not even on a two for one deal.
Yes indeed! This is what Vegas buffets are all about. It's been a while since I've been to Vegas and I visited the buffet at Rio back then. I was tired of people looking at me crazy when I told my archaic Vegas stories, and needed some new experiences. . . Must. Eat. Wicked. Spoon.. . We went in just before all the breakfast items were getting removed for the lunch rush. Perfect timing because eggs are a perfect equalizer after a night of heavy drinking. . 1st plate: I went with salmon benedict, steak benedict, smoked salmon, mini pancakes w powdered sugar, and fruit. Contentment and curiosity kick in; starting to snap out of the hangover haze. . . 2nd plate: I grabbed some duck wings, creamed asparagus, angry mac and cheese, collared greens, teriyaki chicken, egg rolls, and braised beef. My friend who is not a fan of duck enjoyed the duck wings, and I devouredmy second plate before my friend finished her first. "I'll be back.". . 3rd plate: was a blur, but I loaded it up with all kinds of ridiculous combinations. Chow mein, shooters of chocolate mousse, more beef, fried chicken, carrot cake, strawberry lime custard (not so good) mini waffle cones stuffed with chocolate something and other stuff... I could not see the bottom of the plate. Is it wrong to eat on the way back to my seat? More engorging.. . 4th plate: I grabbed a plate of crab legs, a plate of steamed mussels, and was about to explode. My only complaint about the crab legs is that they serve them cold, but I'm sure they would steam them if asked. . . Everything was delicious, I really like the fact that things don't sit out all day and crust over. They are constantly cooking up something new and rotating items to select. (TIP: If you see something you like on a particular trip to the buffet, grab it while you can, it might not be there by the time you come back. This happened twice before I finally got those steamed mussels). . Another customer and I were talking on the way out and he shared his opinion that the buffet in Caesars is much better. I won't take his word for it, but he seemed pretty convinced and big guys take their food seriously. I need to try it myself first, but Wicked Spoon was well worth every penny. Do yourselves a favor and enjoy the experience. . . Another tip: Wicked Spoon is located on a floor within the hotel where smoking is prohibited.
