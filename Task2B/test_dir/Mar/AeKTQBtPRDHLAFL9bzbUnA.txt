Whenever I want to get some AYCE sushi, and still keep it fairly "clean" I love going to Goyemon.  They have items on the menu that you can enjoy and still be reasonable while dieting, ie. non-fried/greasy sushi rolls.  My favorite roll is probably the Ecstasy Roll.  If I had to go with a not so healthy roll, I'd go with the Hurricane Roll (shrimp tempura on the inside).  On a lucky day, the daily specials may include Toro, Blue Fin Tuna and Salmon Belly. . . One of the things that stands out about Goyemon & Sushi Mon, is that their dessert menu is also AYCE.  The only other place that did this was Yama Sushi, but no more.  For that reason, you can't go wrong with Goyemon.  On a busy night, you may find yourself waiting 2 hours.  If it's not too busy, the wait may be 15 minutes.  Either way, bring your appetite!
Long wait, Good food, Service was ok over all experience was good. I've been there many times (from day one) Tony is an amazing Sushi Chef that we have followed around. Only draw back of the place is occupancy. Way to popular for such a small establishment. Price is fair for AYCE and portions are proper. I'm not a big fan of rolls but might mix it up once in a while and have one or two. I prefer sticking to the basics. Will be back to review again, next time I hope to give them that extra star!
My favorite ayce sushi spot! They have a chain of them all have the same menu, all taste great! This one is just my favorite because it's the one I go to most often. Fish is fresh. Rice ratio is good. They have a great dessert menu. Most of time they are quick. Service is good. This should be your go-to spot!
Delicious and affordable which makes me a fan, but service from Gio is the best. Try to ask for him. He's quick and attentive!
Food, . . Meh sushi with plenty of appetizers. The pork brisket is the best to try. . . Service, . . Good service in the beginning, but after a while the server stopped coming to us even when I had both of my hands in the air, maybe because I presented 5 pork briskets? ...... If they don't want me to have any more or try to limit people's portions, then state it. . . Otherwise the food is god for the price.
This is my go to AYCE sushi spot to go to in Vegas. There is usually always a wait when you come here so don't come starving in case it takes an hour for you to be seated. The place is not big and they close the party room sometimes so wont use the tables in there making you wait longer than you have to =/. . What I love about Goyemon is that their fish is usually always fresh. Salmon belly, ikura, and uni are my favorite. Udon is yummy and included in their AYCE menu as well. One of my favorites! Not many AYCE sushi places include udon with their menu so this is a plus forme. For dessert Green Tea Creme Brulee and chocolate moose is yummy!! Also included in their ayce but not listed on the menu so just order it haha. . Their price of $27 a person for AYCE is pretty average here in Vegas. What is pretty ridiculous tho is that it's the same price for kids. Would be nice if they had a half off price for children or something bc I'm pretty sure my 4 year old did not eat $27 worth of food. Then they charged my 6 month old baby $3 to share with me ..I guess smh haha
Our favorite AYCE sushi place in town.  Sometimes you get lucky and don't have to suffer the wait, but a lot of times there is a long one.  And if you get super lucky be sure to try the salmon collar!!
This place has the worst customer service. I come I'm at 10 pm and ask for a table for 5, since I'm the 1st of my party to arrive they tell me they can't seat me until the rest of my party arrives even though there is 20 seats available in the restaurant.  I finally tell the host my party will be here in 10 minutes.  So he seats me, I ask to order then he says my 60 min ordering time starts when I first order. So he's basically punishing my friends. So I guess it's worth pissing off a customer over 10 minutes. Never coming here again.
Delicious. I love that you can get half rolls on most of their AYCE menu and the sushi is BOMB.  The CHUBBY was our favorite roll and I love their salads and pork belly.
Even at 10:30 on a Friday night there was a half hour wait. The good parts about this restaurant is that there is the option to order half rolls. I love to try a lot of different items so it's much easier on the stomach to get the smaller portions. :) The had a braised pork belly dish that we ordered three times because it was so delicious. The pork was so tender and it was beautifully charred on the outside with a nice mango chutney of sorts on the side. The udon noodles we got were also really good. Other than that, the sushi was okay, but it was nothing special. I expected a little more for the price.
I have to be rolled out of this place after AYCE, because I can never say no to the green tea creme brulee after all the sushi. Great selection of rolls and variety of desserts.. . The wait is usually 30-40 minutes at any given time of the day, but we like to use that time to take before we stuff ourselves silly. . . *Will only seat you if your whole party is present
Yum. Even thought this place is completely across town, I would drive here again in a heart beat. you get all you can eat sushi for 27 dollars! And if you come with a large enough group, they'll open up the side room just for you guys. . . mu favorite things is the green tea creme brulee and the fresh wasabi.
Came here for Goyemon's 3rd Anniversary Customer Appreciation event. They required reservations to be made, by request, from a site, that was posted through their facebook (www.mongroupevent.com). Reservations was first come, first serve. The reservation request form was simple to fill out, name, contact info, number of people, times wanted. I was surprised by this because I got no e-mail confirmation or anything. I had called a few days prior, and the girl who picked up a phone, said she had a list on a paper she found, under correct time and # of people, but had no info if it was confirmed. 2 days ago, (monday, i wanted wednesday), is when i received a confirmation text. . . Upon arrival, our reservation was for 7:30. We arrived around 7pm. I had went in to ask to double-check my reservation. Was all good so went outside to sit and wait. There was another yelper there, Chris V., who had an reservation for 7pm, who was still waiting. Doriee and I were like, okay, they are a little backed up. No worries. She glanced into the restaurant to look at the blackboard, where they usually had their specials written. Toro was no where to be found on the menu. I mean sure, it was not on the original "promised" special items on their site (blue fin tuna, wagyu beef, foie gras), but day before, many have said they had AYCE toro. That got us really excited prior to arrival. By 7:35, i had went inside and asked to see the estimated time on wait before we get a table. She glanced around the dining area and she said there is a table whos paying, and will be leaving soon. Ok ! ... wait a minute ... Chris' reservation is 7pm.... so i went outside and waited. Less than a few minutes late, my name was called. UHHHH !!!??? OK THATS WEIRD.... Later we saw they were seated AFTER us. That's bad on their part. They've been waiting here since before we arrived too.... Just because i went in to ask, i got table faster? . . SO ANYWAY...... . When our waitress came up to us to take our drink order, we had asked what was avail today and if toro was AYCE today. NOPE. Toro is limit 1 per person. Same for the Foie Gras nigiri. Wagyu beef, sea urchin, and blue fin tuna is AYCE. DANG IT ! sad. SAD!. SUPER SAD ! IMO thats a bad management on their part. Why allow AYCE one day, and be super limited the next? In my opinion, to manage better, to allow maybe like, 5 orders per person. That way, each who wants, gets a fair amount, and not be SUPER limited, but not be free to order. Bad call on their part. Also, as they had posted on their FB on 2nd day, items are avail until they run out? Uhm, there's a reason why you had a reservation to begin with. To limit the amount of people you have these two days. Not only did you have AYCE one day and not the other, you allowed walk-in's as well. Though it may have been "Said" that its a 1 hour limit on eating time but it is NOT enforced. People sit around and socialize after the end of their meal. No good ! Control and manage better ! . . With that, already a bad start. Doriee and my friend are already upset but we decided to stay and eat, since we were there already. . . Ordered 3 toro, 3 amaebi, 3 foie gras, 5 blue fin, 5 yellow tail, salmon, 3 kobe beef, and a half of a 9-1-1 roll to start. . . Blue Fin Tuna, was fresh. Each fish piece was actually cut fairly thick. . . Wagyu Beef Nigiri. First 3 orders. VERY thin and "broken" cuts of meat. Like it ripped open because they sliced too thin. Meat was not tender, as what a high quality meat should be. The "carrot?" topping was a bit weird. Ponzu? sauce used made it weird as well. Was not a good combination at all. poorly executed. . . Foie Gras Nigiri - topped with, i believe, fried onions?, seared foie gras, and probably an unagi (or similar) sauce? That was weird too. the sauce used covered the taste of the foie gras. You can really taste the foie gras if you ate a straight up piece, untouched with anything but, in combination with the fried onions, sauce, and rice. flavors gone. poor executed as well, in my opinion. . . Toro Nigiri (fatty tuna) - the most sought after order. considering we were limited to ONE order per person on the SECOND night of their event, we tried our best to "Savor" the pieces. With my experience with toro, it is supposed to be naturally sweet, super fatty and tender, little to no chewing needed. This toro, thinly cut. not as tender and soft. Some chewy bits as well. SAD ! . . Amaebi Nigiri (Sweet shrimp) - this wasnt bad. granted neither of the people i went wanted to eat it, so i ate all 3 orders. Size of the amaebi was actually fairly large. larger than normal actually. nice and sweet, and gives a nice "bite" texture. fresh. . . Uni Nigiri (Sea Urchin) - considering their no limit on sea urchin, i had high hopes for this as well. Considering their fast usage, i was expecting fresh and sweet. Nope. little to no sweet taste. okay freshness. . . Overall experience, meh. Had high hopes for this event, looked forward to it, but was quite the disappoint.
This place has HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Especially the hostess/cashier in the front, the lady has serious attitude problem: if your staff cannot deal with human being in the front, please schedule that person to work BOH, so she/he can provide the best use of his/her labor. We had problem with this lady on 2 different occasions already. Once was on Christmas eve /day, I called ahead of time to see if they were open, and was told they are open till 9PM. So I went there around 5ish, and was told by the lady that they STOP seating already, I understand that you were busy, but the tone and attitude she had was really bad, and rude.. Second time was last night, we got there early, again 5ish, SAME person: "sorry we stop seating for today unless you have a reservation", I replied "I thought you guys dont' take reservations?!", she answered "yes, we don't, but it's our 3rd anniversary, so we open for reservations.", I asked her how would the customer know if they can or cannot book reservation, she replied with a VERY rude and unprofessional tone, "well, if you have been to our restaurant for the last few weeks, we have been talking about it.".. REALLY?? so you are telling me that if I don't go every week, Im NOT welcome here?!? I work in service industry, I know how important it is to be nice to your customer, even the assholes, I always answer with a smile on the face when Im in front of customers, I also co-own a restaurant, and I know damn right it's NOT the right way to treat the customers. She better be the owner there, otherwise the owner should really consider to get rid of her, she obviously can not be working as the front of the house. There are plenty of sushi houses in town, food there is not bad, but for the last few times I went there, the service had been lacking and some of the service staffs have the attitude of "oh-our-place-is-so-good-and-you-are-SOOOO-lucky-to-eat-here, now-what-the-heck-do-you-want-me-to-bring-you?". I will not be the one that's paying money to take shit from service staffs. NEVER GO THERE AGAIN and I will make sure to tell anyone I know.
Sushi house goyemon has been our go to sushi place since it opened.  It's always busy so plan on waiting a while.  Although things have changed a bit since it first opened (no more collar!) it is still a great choice for AYCE sushi.  My one complaint with them is that they are so busy, they can sometimes be rude with service as you are finishing up.  The host once asked us to hurry up with dessert as they were waiting to seat a large party.  No problem, I understand, but we had only been there an hour and we weren't lingering at all.  I know the rules, eat and leave, but this was over the top.  . The sushi is always fresh, delicious, and at a great price for what you get so I'll keep coming back.  Our favorite is the salmon belly..practically melts in your mouth.  The big eye tuna was another one of our favorites but I haven't seen it on the menu in a while.  Overall a great place for AYCE sushi with good food at great prices.
Visit Goyemon again with my parents. Most of the servers are new. Jessica was our server (name on the check), for the whole 1.5 hours dinning experience, I never see her smile. She even rolled her eyes on us when we were thinking what drinks we would like to order, come on, service sucks!!
If you are looking for AYCE Sushi then this is a must. Very reasonable priced around $25-27 I believe. I was turned on to this place by one of my training partners. The rolls are all pretty good and my favorite is probably the super white tuna nigiri (pictured below) I could eat that all day. . . The only down side I can give it is the size of the restaurant. It is small and more than once I have had 45 mintue wait times. I've never actually waited 45 mins though, maybe closer to about 25-30 minutes and they get you in.  I usually attend with a party of 3-4 people. I imagine if you had a large party you should call in advance and set something up instead of just showing up and having to wait. . . Customer service issolid for how busy it is. Another good thing is it is open until I believe 2am or 3am with last seating about an hour before close. We always have a good time hanging out at this place. Obvioulsy we also always make sure to get our moneys worth!
For the life of me, I don't understand the controversy surrounding this place? But I do know that's what got me there. You know what they say, there is no such thing as bad publicity.  :). . A group of eight came in Saturday morning. We were there when it opened, so we were promptly seated. It was $21.95 for all-you-can-eat. The decor was nice, it was clean. Service was a tad slow, but I could understand, since we were in a big group. . . Onto the food... for $21.95 I can't complain... it was more than adequate. The nigiri was hit and miss, but get this, you can get BLUE FIN tuna! What? Yes. And it's included in the AYCE price. There was also Spanish mackerel and uni. Wow. I've never seen that before. . . There's also standard Americanized rolls and Japanese appetizers. Again, they were hit and miss. I thought the tuna poke was great. The takoyaki balls perfectly fried, but only had tiny pieces of tako. I tried the natto rolls for the first time and they were true to form, but natto is not for me. . . In conclusion, if you want a life-changing, sublime, dining experience... go to Bar Masa. If you're a local, looking for a decent sushi-fix, thrown-in with some high quality nigiri cuts... come here.
My new favorite AYCE sushi joint in Vegas... Aside from the hour wait lol. Be sure to come and check in a little before starvation mode before you die from waiting outside in the hot parking lot.
When I first got here they quoted me about 20 min for a seat, I was seated in 5. Go for the all you can eat and if you can, sit at the bar. Extremely fast service, kind of a team serving effort, which was a little different, but my cup was never empty and my plate was always full with delicious sushi. I will definitely be coming back here on my next trip to Vegas.
Price and quality are outstanding! The service is a little rushed, but that seems common for AYCE establishments.... All in all, I would definitely recommend. this place!!. . Highlights. . Salmon. Octopus . Uni. Tuna. Pork belly. Baked green mussels( at least four orders every time I come). Jala jala roll.   For dessert, green tea creme brulee - yum!. . Also, if you love lemon and are unfamiliar with yuzu juice, be sure to ask for it! A must!
This place would easily have earned four stars if not for their lack in service.. . It's surprising how small this place is for AYCE.  We arrived around 5:30pm, expecting to have to wait at least an hour for my party of eight.  The wait was as expected, but what killed me was that we were placed in this little "secret" room off to the side - a room that had been closed off and EMPTY since I first arrived!  Um, why weren't we just seated here to begin with instead of having to wait?. . As we prepared to sit, two friends called to let us know they'd be joining as well.  I let the hostess know, apologized for the change, and said that we totally didn't mind squeezing in together.  The table had plenty of space, and all we needed was two chairs and place settings.  That's when our main waitress started to get snippy.  She was short when answering questions and had an air of attitude about her to a point where my friends and I found ourselves staring at each other in awkward silence on more than one occasion.  Thanks for a lovely meal (yes, you can sense the sarcasm).. . Lastly, I didn't learn until after we had left that Sushi House offers a loyalty program - one stamp for every visit, and ten stamps to earn on free AYCE meal.  They probably didn't even offer me one on purpose, since I'd have earned my free meal during that visit.  Shady.. . Food, and the variety if it, was fine, but if I were to return, I'll come back with a much smaller group.  Hopefully service would be better then.
Was recommended by a friend, and not disappointed! The seared salmon nigiri is amazing, along with the red snapper. The octopus was good, if only it didn't have the seaweed wrap (it makes it a little fishy for my liking). Can't wait to go back and expand my sushi palate.
Our favorite sushi place ! I'm a vegetarian and found plenty of yummy options, my favorite roll is NATO hand roll with added veggies. The cucumber salad and seaweed salad is amazing and I love the lycee ice cream !!
