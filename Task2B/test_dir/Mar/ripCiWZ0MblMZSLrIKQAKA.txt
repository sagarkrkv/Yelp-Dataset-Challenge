Where's the wifi guys??? Oh that's right I need to upgrade my ipad air to a laptop and get a Ethernet cable to get internet in room or better yet just walk around Monte Carlo with my ipad...sweet...get with it there are cheaper places that get it... Now for the rooms..stayed here 3 nights..happy with location and easy to find our room but the room itself needs updating...bed was comfy..housekeeping was alright.. Bathroom sucked!!!! I took a Luke warm shower everyday and the tub occasionally would fill up with water (slow draining) it just felt dirty and I felt more dirty even after showering.. Bring your own soap,shampoo and conditioner they don't soap up. . .  room and resort fees ,.what a rip, customer service and check in was good... But let's try and keep up with the rest.. I will consider staying again if it was free....  I would elaborate more but I need to contact the hotel first
I reserved a suite and it wasn't available when I came to check in....so they upgraded me for free to the diamond suite. That was awesome. I was meeting friends there and we enjoyed the two bathrooms in the suite as we'll as the jacuzzi in the master bath. The room service was great and gave us extra of whatever we needed (mostly coffee capsules for the coffee machine in the room). The casino is fun and friendly and the poker room is very intimate and easy on newbies. Enjoyed every second.
In November 2013, I had a good experience. When we checked in, we had very friendly help & we were surprised with a comped daily buffet for two. Nice! The food was very good. Our room was very clean and I was so happy to be getting a great view from the 23rd floor. The floor was quiet and I had no trouble sleeping. One thing that I was disappointed with was that there was no wifi in the room.
Under Construction so we lost some photo ops. And the pool wasn't open. . . Our AC never got cold and maintenance even admitted that the hotel was too old to have a nice system that would actually put out cold air.. . The carpet was dirty and stained. The halls smelled.. . The rooms were all connecting so we heard our annoying neighbors. And they kept opening the door on their side to our door and I'm just like, "we don't know you! We're not going to open our door!". . The only reason it got two stars from me was because the service at the front desk was good. She was super nice. And the housekeeping staff was super nice as well.
Meh. . Best for the 40-60 year old set. . It is close to everything, but the decor is dated and no attractions (restaurants or shows). Blue Man group is playing, which was fun.....in the 1990s. . When I checked in they put me in the wrong room, so I had to move the next day- without any compensation. . . Don't use Showtime tours (linked through their website). An hour delay on arrival and didn't pick me up on departure.
Great hotel. It's not as grandiose as some of the others but it does the job as a great Las Vegas hotel. For the price I think it would be a great stay.
It's not the hottest newest hotel in Vegas that's for sure.. But it's also not the worst.. I've stayed here a few times.. The location is awesome and the rooms are a good price.. Hotel staff has always been super friendly to us, and our rooms have been clean, luckily.. In the summertime they play music out by the pool. It manages to be sort of relaxing even though it's crowded. There were people of all ages which I didn't mind. I don't appreciate bros with bacon skin and hair gel fist pumping, so although its not a Vegas beach party in the Carlo's pool area, it's still fun enough.. . Also, this hotel is pretty small especially by Vegas standards, so when you and your drunken girlfriends come back from partying, in your clubwear and heels, gripping each others hands for dear life so you don't fall ass over tea kettle onto the casino carpet, you can STILL find your room. . . I appreciated the little convenience store where I bought mini bottles of champagne and the Starbucks downstars. They have a candy store too, which was fun, but the one in the Paris is better. . . It's not glitzy, but it's decent for the price and service is nice.
Andres cigar bar is a great place to try rare single malt flights 5 for $25 on a Wednesday  and enjoy great Appies and a good cigar
Check in was fast, no issues with staff or rudeness as several other reviews mentioned. Decor in rooms is pretty outdated, but the bed was super comfortable- softer than I'm used to with hotel beds. Fixtures in bathroom are very old. That is a weird thing to mention in a review, but the bathroom door handle and tub faucet wasn't all the way attached and the tub dripped throughout our stay. The water pressure was insane. I'm pretty sure I lost a few layers of skin. . . The pool area is nice- enough space to find a patch of sun even when it was busy. Drink/food service was pretty fast at the pool. . . Casino was nicer than I expected- pretty clean & good air quality. The cafe had good breakfast. . . I'm one of the last 10 people in my late 20's without one of those fancy internet phones, so I didn't mind not having wifi, but others in our party were slightly annoyed at this. But what is with the resort fees? I'm so happy I paid $20/day for a miniature bottle of water & cheap coffee (not Keurig as described). Not a huge deal, but would have been nice to know about up front. . . Overall, a mediocre experience here, and if I ever come back to Vegas, I will stay elsewhere.
For a "cheaper" hotel the Monte Carlo is very nice.. I stay here because I get discounted room rates for my play, and I am very pleased with the rooms.  Unless you are getting a suite, a hotel room in vegas is a hotel room.  The rooms here are very standard.. . The main amenity I like is the food court.  In vegas, if you are not careful, you can quickly overspend on your budget.  Having a food court with cheap food options for breakfast or lunch is very nice to keep the trip within budget.. . The pools are also nice - but different.  There is a lazy river and a wave pool.  The river is very nice to relax and float around in.. . The casino floor is decent - not huge, but has enough games.. . The poker room is small, but I enjoy the friendly dealers.  They are very nice and conversatons with them are enjoyable.  Because of this, I enjoy playing poker at MC.
The "strip view" room was alright.  A pretty typical hotel room that you would get at a motel 6.  The maids could do a little better of a job.  The air vents are covered in dust and the bathroom grout is nasty/moldy.  The view of the strip was nice except you also look down on the massive, ugly roof of the casino.  They don't have any wifi but offer free wired internet via an ethernet port.  The Keurig they promised isn't a Keurig.  It's some weird generic coffee machine.  It's not a bad hotel, it's just not really that great either.  Overpriced for what you get.
Kind of a trashy place if I'm being honest. Everything is old, icky, and not entirely clean. The wallpaper in our room was peeling and we found broken outlets. Super safe, right?. Also, there was no one our age here at all. I wish I had known everyone was at least 50 years old. My boyfriend and I (22 and 25) felt very out of place.. Finally, the biggest reason we will not be back is that the place is an overall ripoff. I just can't figure out why they charge at extra $20 resort fee for stuff like water and craps lessons. Does this mean we can opt out of these services? No!. Similarly, they do annoying things like give out free drink tickets for spending some certain amount of money at the (ghetto) casino. The thing about these drink tickets is that it's not as easy as walking up to the bar and asking for a drink. You have to track down the mythical waitress to get your drink. I never foundthis waitress although the bartender swore was "around here somewhere." So thanks for the useless drink tickets, that ended up coming home in my pockets.. Generally an icky place. Won't be back.
We enjoyed our one night stay at this hotel recently.  The rooms were dated, but we paid less than 100 for the night, and got to stay on the strip! We were pleased!  The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was great!  We enjoyed the restaurants and lounges that were in the hotel as well. The only complaint I have is about the wait to check in.  I felt like I was at wal-mart--- you know, all those cash registers, and only 4 people working... This hotel had more than a dozen check in desks, but only 3 or 4 employees working, so we stood in line to check in for about 20 minutes.... . Oh, we also saw the Blue Man Group- FANTASTIC show!
Nothing spcial, nothing terrible.. . The rooms were clean, and I really liked how I could walk out of the self-parking garage directly to the lobby w/ elevators so I could go up to my room. That was something special to me. They have Keurigs in the rooms, but the coffee tastes expired. The bottled water is part of your resort fee - speaking of which, I had a comp night here and the guy who checked me in handed me back my card and told me he wasn't even going to charge the resort fee. Kudos, shout outs, and thumbs up.. . I didn't explore any of the hotel at all, instead, just spending the night here. It's definitely an older hotel and it's rather dated, especially in the rooms and corridors.. . Overall, I'd stay here again... if it was complimentary only.
Absolutely horrible. The front of the hotel was under constriction and they didnt tell is that when we booked. My husband and I reserved a king bed, and instead we got two doubles. When I called down to. Ask about it, they said they "didnt have anything available" even tho we booked. Our trip 3 months in advance. Their solution was to give us one the next day in the smoking section. The bathtub had black hair all over it, and the glasses provided for us has lipstick stains on them, the floor wasnt vacuumed either. My. Husband called this time. To complain and they offered us a $30 food credit. We ended up staying one night out of 4 in the hotel and got. A refund. This place is a joke.
The Monte Carlo is a nice place to stay on the Strip. The rooms are nice enough but I have been spoiled by the Trump on my first trip to Vegas so it's not really fair to compare the two. My entire experience at the Monte Carlo was a pleasant one, from check-in to check-out. The staff was really friendly and the concierge services were super helpful. . . Although I'm not a huge fan of casinos, mainly because of the smoke, it was kind of nice to have it there for entertainment. I also liked the convenience of the food court. Yes, there are much much better places to eat but when I'm craving a McChicken at 1 in the morning, I just want a McChicken! I probably ate more McDonald's in my short trip in Vegas that I did the entire last year. I'm not proud of it, but it happened!. . The casino itself was ok. Don't bother expecting any sort of drink service though. I don't think I saw a single server the entire time I was there. Luckily, there is a bar at one end of the casino in case you really need a drink. . . I do wish that the hotel was more centrally located on the Strip. The tram that they have is kind of a joke; I feel like it doesn't really get you anywhere. I would stay here again if the price was right.
This is a pretty nice hotel for the price. It's four-star hotel rating is a bit inflated (as with all of Las Vegas), but it's also cheaper than four-star hotels elsewhere (again a feature of Las Vegas), so it all works out in the end. Amenities include TV, a safe, and wired internet. The safe is large enough to hold a laptop or a small purse, but anything larger (like a backpack) won't fit. Since the internet is wired, be sure to bring a laptop if you want to use the internet. Your smartphone/tablet won't work. With the way the economy is going, they probably haven't had the money to upgrade to wifi. The interior decor is OK, maybe more like a three-star hotel, but the lobby is quite opulent.. . The parking structure is across the street, with a second-floor sky bridge connecting them. When you enter through the sky bridge, you will first go down an escalator to get to the lobby, then proceed to the elevators which is also where the casino entrance is.. . When booking, you can pay extra for a high-floor (21+)* room for a better view and even more for a high-floor room with a view of the Strip.. . * No, I don't mean only people of legal drinking age can stay in these rooms, I literally mean 21st floor and up.
Recently stayed at the Monte Carlo with my sister for Spring Break/Bachelorette. We arrived around 9pm and checked in quickly. Our room was the very last room on the 8th floor. View of parking garage. There was some long black curtains with a stand hanging in front of the door to the room across from us and it looked like they just needed a place to stick it and decided next to our room! Also, there was a tray of beer and old food that looked like it had been sitting there for days. We had to walk around it each time we went to our room. . . The room: BLAH. The floor was stained (looked like many people had thrown up on it over the years...) there was candy on the floor from the previous guests. Other than that it seemed clean enough. Nothing special at all, no fridge, no wifi, and all the outlets but one were taken so no charging your phone next to the bed! The safe didn't work, it was open and wouldn't shut. I called the front desk and they sent up security who demanded my ID like a criminal. They said any time they open the safe they have to check ID. I proceeded to tell him the safe was OPEN and nothing was in it so why do I need to show ID? He snapped at me that if I had a problem with their policies to take it up with the front desk. I did and they gave me a $50 credit. They also had to send up 2 more people before the safe got fixed. Also complained about the food sitting outside of our room for over a day and they finally came and picked it up. . . Went to the pool the next day. It was good enough but I've been to better in Vegas. Also the wave pool was dirty lots of "debris" in it. Came back to the room and it had only been halfway cleaned. Again called to the front desk and they offered to send someone up but at that point we were trying to get ready for a night out so we declined. On our way out we heard someone else on our floor say their room was only halfway cleaned too. The next day we had a housekeeping supervisor come to our room and tell us she thoroughly cleaned our room. Parts of the room looked spotless and then parts were still not done like the day before. . . Last day for check out I wanted to just do express checkout, reviewed my bill and the $50 credit was not applied. Had to wait in a very long line to speak with someone to get it applied. Overall I was dissatisfied with our trip and I will not be staying here again. They put us in the farthest room, looked like they were using our hallway as a storage area, and a trash area for room service. Not happy at all.
i would give this hotel a negative rating if i could. Only gave it a star just because of its great location on the strip. i booked this hotel because my aunts were staying here for the weekend as well. i should have spent extra $$ to stay at the wynn or somewhere else. if you're not staying at their spa suites then forget about this place. it's pretty worn down and outdated.
VEGAS! not hard to have a bad time here right? well it can be frustrating when many little things go wrong. Monte Carlo has many great upsides too it as well as a few downsides. . . Upsides: great location if you would like to stay on the strip. Walking distance to many other casino. Service at the front desk was excellent. Price was reasonable for the quality of the room, minus the downsides in the room (see below) Sports Book was friendly but a bit understaffed. minus 5 bar is cool (literally). . Downsides: Bar tenders at almost every bar in the casino were slow, seemed unhappy at their job. Bit of a "Debbie downer" attitude (but waitresses were great) rooms had no WiFi capability. This one baffled me, but they still used an old school hardwire plug in. So dont bring an ipad an expect to use WiFi. The bathroom in our room spelled like sewage. Good thing we didn't spend much time in the room but the odor was bad. Smelled like the plumbing was backed up. . . Our experience here started off a little rocky with not being able get a WiFi signal in the room. Especially when you have work that needs to be done. 2nd was the smelly bathroom and taking a hot shower just made it worse. Then walking down stairs for a drink and having slow/rude bar service did not help. But with the rest of the trip going well and hotel being right on the strip, it was worth the stay. Would do it again, just as long as the plumbing issue is fixed
I have to say I was a bit disappointed with the Monte Carlo. The hotel seems like they skimped on construction costs and here's why. Walls seem thin. We could hear the people in the other room next to ours. People walking and talking in the hallway are easily heard. The tour helicopters flying down the strip are easily heard through the windows. No wifi in the rooms only an old school wired internet cable. No refrigerator. The electrical outlets were either missing the plastic cover (behind the nightstand) or felt loose when pulling the plug out of the outlet. Seemed like a possible safety hazard to me. . . I realize this isn't the Bellagio but for the money I expected a little bit better quality. We stayed on the fifth floor and can hear the traffic down below on the street.
Been a while since we stayed here but just as we remembered.. . Downside - the rooms are a bit outdated, the bathroom faucet leaked all night, we had trouble with sketchy wifi and when we moved the couch over we saw the carpet hadn't been vacuumed in lord knows how long.. . Upside - spacious suite, excellent view, comfy bed, slept great, restaurants are fantastic, location is great and staff is friendly.. . . My husband was extremely frustrated with the wifi when we first arrived because it was needed to get sone work done, which he ended up losing some when documents couldn't save, but once work was out of the way we had a great time.
This review is for Drew, the bartender at the Brain Freeze Bar at the Pool at the Monte Carlo. While the casino at the Monte Carlo is a little boring, the pool is great!  If you go to the pool, you have to see Drew, the bartender at the Brain Freeze Bar! He makes the best drinks and his Bloody Mary's are the best on the planet! He really made our stay a lot of fun.  It's people like Drew that will keep us coming back to see him.  The other bar at the pool is ok, but Drew at the Brain Freeze is the man to see!. Every pool needs a Drew!  Thanks Drew!
Monte Carlo Hotel is older, so my experience at this hotel was average. Considering that I've stayed at the Trump Hotel on the Strip, Monte Carlo looks ancient. . . Pros:. - On the Strip.. - You can take a tram to go to Aria and/or Bellagio.. - Toiletries, hair dryer, safe, coffee maker, two free bottles of water.. - Cheap for $60/night as our conference had a special promotion for registered participants.. . Cons:. - No wifi. I was on the 18th floor and I had to use an Ethernet cable to get Internet.I paid $20 for a resort fee, and they should have wifi! . - Tub needed to be replaced as there were cracks. . - Even though this hotel is eco-friendly, Housekeeping still replaced my towels even though they were on the racks. What is the point of posting a sign to not replace towels if Housekeeping isn't going to follow it? . - Bed was old. I can feel the springs.
Stayed here when I was 18 & it was great! The location on the strip is still good but 10 years later the hotel still looks the same :/ It's outdated & hello no working WiFi is totally unexceptable!!! The whole weekend we were frustrated trying to get some kind of Internet service! It was just horrible! . Also our reservation was wrong & they gave us two handicap rooms with one bed instead of regular two queens in them. They did bring a cot to each room but that was not what was reserved! They offered us the choice to swap into the correct rooms in the morning but when we called @ 11 am they said rooms wouldn't be available until maybe as late as 4pm. We gave up since we weren't going to just wait around to move. We wanted to go have fun...which we did! . Had a blast as always in Sin City but definitely would not stay @ Monte Carlo again!
I don't know about some of the bad reviews but we just stayed there for 3 nights during Spring Break and it was Awesome!!! We are a family of 4 with our kids being 12 and 8 and everything was perfect!!  . Our rooms were great and Clean! The staff was courteous and friendly. The restaurants were great and the pool area was clean and fun!!!  We will definately stay there again!
Spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere....very rude dealers, pit bosses are worse and don't even get me started on upper management; also, rooms are hit or miss...mostly miss...gross!!
