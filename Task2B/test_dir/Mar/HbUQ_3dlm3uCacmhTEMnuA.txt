We shared the rib eye, which was grilled and seasoned to perfection.  It was amazing!  We also had a salad, fingerling potatoes, and grilled veggies.  The only thing that didn't come through was the dessert.  We ordered 6 scoops of sorbet/ice cream.  One of the flavors was mango/passionfruit and it was unbearably sour and in my opinion inedible.  The dessert should be be spot on as this is your last chance to make a great impression.  Unfortunately it left a sour taste in our mouths.  And when we notified the waiter, he didn't really apologize or ask if we'd like another flavor.  Other than that, it was an amazing dining experience!
Dinner there on Saturday.  7 of us celebrating a birthday.  We had the chef's choice surf and turf menu and wine pairing.  The meats were terrific, sides excellent, wine smartly chosen and plentiful and our server Marvin was pleasant and a pro.  Star count would have been higher but the surf in the surf and turf was overcooked lobster and not just a little overcooked.  Rubber city. We said something but were dismissed.  I would have made a bigger deal but did not want to ruin the occasion for the guest of honor.  When multiple guests complain and leave quite a bit of lobster on the table uneaten. there is a problem that they should have addressed.  Bill was well over $1200 and the lobster was $30 per person.  They should have eaten that loss because we certainly did not want to eat the lobster
Service was excellent - our server was very knowledgeable about both the wines and menu and encouraged us ("We're not toooo hungry") to share - which was the right choice!. Our steaks (the bone in strip & the filet) were both very large cuts.  The strip was perfectly cooked, and the filet a bit under - but still delicious.  For sides we loved the potato puree, roasted Brussels sprouts, and Bibb salad.  We also ordered the roasted butternut squash but had to send it back as half of it was completely undercooked.. We also enjoyed two desserts - the baked souffle and the kind of "deconstructed" creme brulee... to die for!  . It was pricey, but worth what we paid.  Would I go back? Ehhh... on the fence... with so many options, can't say I would or wouldn't.
I was staying at the MGM so it was quite convenient to have this restaurant downstairs.. . The atmosphere was quite comfortable sitting at table in the bar area.. . The wine list was broad enough that I was able to find "reasonable" priced selections that worked well.. . We split a lobster to start. It was supposed to be 2.5 lbs and maybe it was but out of the shell it was a few choice bites for each. The Kumamoto oysters were divine.. . Kept it simple with the dry aged strip that was super tasty yet slightly cooked past my medium rare request. The mushrooms were a very interesting assortment so we got a mix of all of them. . . All in all everything was good to very good. The service was spot on and being so convenient in my hotel a short walk to the elevator made for a pleasant dinner.
Had a reservation at Craftsteak on a recent Thursday night.  The hostess would not even look up from her podium when she hardly gave us an insincere verbal acknowledgement that was a simple and bothered-sounding "hi".   We asked if we could sit side by side at a table and with her same bothered demeanor we were told sure but it could be 10-15 mins.  About 30 mins later with NO communication we asked the hostess for an update.  Again we were made to feel like we were being a bother and life would be easier for the greeter (and the manager who we called over) if we just left.  So we did.  And took a taxi over to Ocean Club at the Crystal Shops where we had a fantastic experience start to finish.  On a side note, as we waited in the bar for our table we saw a lot of food being delivered to tables that looked and smelled amazing.  But there are far better places in Vegas that will give hospitable service from the point of entry as well as great good food.
If you have the money and want to spend it on a great steak dinner, this challenges any steakhouse I've been in.Enjoy the great scotches, steaks, and atmosphere.   Just a fun place for good food and elegant surrounding.
I have lived in Vegas for 11 years and have eaten at most every steak place in town.  In my opinion, Craftsteak has terrible cuts.  Their fillet was tough and dry with a strange flavor (medium rare).  Their mushrooms were stale and asparagus was old.  The service was mediocre at best, I felt neglected on water refills.  It was not just the fillet but also the t-bone my wife had.  The T-bone was very thin and tasted very strange, almost a chemical flavor like the solution they used to clean the grill.
The food and service was just simply amazing here. My husband treated me to this amazing place on Valentine's day and we ordered so much only because everything was so darn good. . Seafood Sampler was to die for!!  The wagyu beef tartar was ok a bit over powered by sesame seed oil.  But the porterhouse steak for 2 was just melt in your mouth,  slice it with your fork bomb-diddley-iscious!! . What you pay is what you get...  from service to food quality. I am definitely coming back here. . Keep up the amazing work management and staff!!
Service was solid, steak was amazing.  Tuna tartar was one of the best i have had in the USA.  Well done Tom!
As an avid fan of Top Chef, I have watched Tom Colicchio on so many occasions shred a chef for failure to season food, especially not to use salt and pepper.  Imagine my surprise to find underseasoned food in every course at Craftsteak.  At $300 for dinner for two with one drink and one glass of wine, no dessert, I do expect better than this.  . . The starter of lobster salad was very good, just woefully underseasoned, lacking both salt and pepper and not tasting very much of the ginger alleged to be in the dressing.  My very expensive shrimp cocktail had a very faint taste of iodine which really surprised me.  Moving to the salad course, my partner's beet salad featured under-roasted and bland beets with no salt to speak of and a dressing so mild as to be nearly nonexistent.  My salad of persian cucumber was nearly undressed and the vinaigrette tasted barely of lemon juice and olive oil.  There was no savor to the dish at all.  Since everything is a la carte, here, $14 for unseasoned raw veggies is not the way to my heart.. . I will say the short rib main was delicious.  My bone-in prime NY steak was a flavorsome cut of meat, but the absence of seasoning did not enhance the steak.  While the room was very nice and service good, underseasoned food in every course pretty much ruined the experience for me.  The side dishes were generous portions, but ran the gamut in quality.  Asparagus was bitter and a bit woody.  Grits were very nice if in need of a bit of salt.  The mushroom assortment was undercooked.  The Maui onions were the star side at our table.  Quite good.  Again, for what this place charges, they need better quality control.  . . . I could not in good conscience recommend this place to friends, because at this level, the food ought to be well-seasoned and well-prepared, every course, every time.  I know "celebrity" chefs are too busy to actually cook in their eponymous venues, but they could at least hire executive chefs who would occasionally taste the offerings to find out what the line cooks are doing.  The wine list is quite extensive with some very nice offerings, but with such variable quality in the food, it would be frustrating to order a special vintage if the food was as uneven as we experienced.  In short, would not return here since there are too many truly wonderful places in Las Vegas.
Really enjoyed this restaurant! We arrive a bit early for our reservations, and were still seated within minutes. My husband and I were able to enjoy a couple of cocktails and then a half bottle of wine (this combination was suggested by the sommelier), and shared the filet mignon and the rib eye, with sides of brussel sprouts and risotto. Everything was just amazing and our steaks were perfectly cooked to medium rare. The sprouts and risotto were flavorful and rich. . . We were a little bit overwhelmed by the wine list, which was mostly full of wines that were priced much higher than we would consider ($200-$3,000 a bottle). But we were still able to find a good, though very small, selection of more reasonably priced wines. . . We would have liked to try an appetizer or dessert, but we were sort of crunched for time so didn't have the chance. Maybe next time!
Food is amazing. Service is even better. My wife and I have gone here for our last three anniversaries and we have never been disappointed. It is a bit expensive but you get what you pay for. We always get the 4 course tasting menu. The salads and soup are a great start. The meat was cooked perfectly. I always come back for the mushroom sampler platter. It is the perfect compliment to any steak. We will be back for sure.
Hands down the best food I have ever had! Craft will undoubtedly be one of my stops the next time I go to Vegas. It's definitely pricey, but well worth it in my opinion. The steak is so tender and juicy, you can cut it with a fork. Everything is absolutely amazing at this restaurant!!!
Food was wonderful - service was great!!!  Large portions - sides were enough for 2.  Had reservations & was seated immediately..  Pear martini was delicious.  Another treat on the menu was Monkey Bread for desert.... Food was pricey but worth the experience....
We had a work dinner on St. Paddy's day - it was wonderful.  Everything was served family style and everything was just plain old delicious.  We started with organic greens, and a plate of prosciutto - both were awesome: well seasoned and well executed.  The mains were rib eye, salmon, chicken with a side of risotto, mushrooms and asparagus.  Everything was just great esp the rib eye (as it should be since it's a steak house afterall).  But the best part of the meal was the dessert - the chocolate banana bread cake was to die for (in fact, I had an extra one to-go!).  But so was the awesome cinnabon-like glazed doughnut - it was just too die for!  I'd come back here just for that.
Every time I go to Las Vegas, I always make a point to dine here. There are hundreds of steakhouses in Vegas, and I've tried many, but I always compare every steakhouse to meet Craftsteak standards and none has so far (Cut comes close). . . Their domestic waygu surf and turf tasting menu is fantastic. They give you 3 meats to share: hanger, strip, and ribeye with sides and can't recall what fish was included. The meat melts in your mouth and everyone leaves so happy and full. I've ordered this for my brothers bachelor party and when I'm here for business with other colleagues and clients. . . When I'm in Vegas alone for business, I like sitting at their bar and order grilled hanger steak. Best bargain in Vegas in my opinion for a great steak. . . From their service, the decor, and to a great selection of wines, Craftsteak is my favorite steakhouse in Vegas!
This was a very good dining experience. Having visited high end steak houses all around the world, I would say our actual food and drink experience at Craftsteak was delicious and the service very nice (with some gentle requests...a table not next to the service stand, and time to enjoy our pre-meal cocktail). All requests were honored, and the service and meal memorable. My only complaint...if we are dropping $500 on dinner, please do not run your vaccum until we have finished our after dinner cordial. I look forward to returning.
We had a lovely dinner experience this past Tuesday at Craftsteak. It was our first time dining there and were guests at the MGM Grand.. . My scallops were absolutely phenomenal and my husband's steak was also wonderful. We loved the sides and SERVICE, but the monkey bread and apple creme brulee desserts were the pinnacle of our dinners. . . Our only complaint is the number of men allowed to wear hats in such a fine dining establishment. No staff made the attempt to ask them to remove them.. . We look forward to our next experience at Craftsteak.
My girlfriend and I have been to the Craftsteak at MGM Foxwoods a number of times prior to it closing and I would give that location 5 stars. Our experience here wasn't as enjoyable.. . We decided to give it a try Wednesday night. Having looked on opentable the day or so prior, it seemed like there were plenty of times available so I didn't bother making a reservation. When we arrived at 8:15, we were told the soonest we could be seated was 9:30.We decided to look elsewhere to eat. While doing so, out of curiosity I decided to take a peak at my opentable app and was able to book a reservation at 8:45, which caused us some confusion. Why couldn't they have booked this reservation at the hostess desk? We show back up at 8:45, were seated within a minute, and walked by several open tables at the bar which we specificied earlier would have been fine. Kind of left a bad taste in our mouths to start. . . Every time we've gone to Craftsteak at Foxwoods, we'd share the wagyu ribeye and it was easily the best steak I've ever had, every time. Worth every penny of the $100+. We ordered what we assumed was the same waygu ribeye, but it was unmistakably different. It was the leanest ribeye I've everhad, from the Texas Roadhouse to Grill 32 Boston. If I was told it was a sirloin, I'd think yeah this pretty good...for a sirloin.. . The Foxwood's steak was cut to be shared and the marbleization was so extensive the pieces would fall apart as you lifted it, and those smaller pieces would melt in your mouth. A knife was not needed. . . I did some research, finding the Craftsteak at Foxwoods menu PDF, even though they closed: http://www.foxwoods.com/uploadedFiles/Pages/Dine/craftsteak_menu.pdf. They were both 14 oz wagyu ribeyes, but the one at Foxwoods specifies the grade (8) and the farm (Sher Ranch, Australia), and was also $134 vs the $105. We were told by the manager they get their meat from the same farm as the other locations. I didn't have these details at the time, but it didn't matter, it was not comparable. The price different is my only objective evidence of these steaks being of different grades and/or from a different ranch.. . What saved the rating was the service. We voiced our confusion and slight dissatisfaction, and they were more than willing to replace it but we declined. To our surprise, they comped the steak which was shocking considering the price.
Love this place!! We eat here at least once when were in town,normally we come here our last night in Vegas for a great and wonderful evening dinner.. The Kobe and Wagyu beef is phenomenal and prepared excellent!! . The beef practically melts in your mouth.
Classy, but pricey! I loved loved this place, but wow do you pay for it. 6 of us topped 830 bucks for wine, dinner, and apps. Didnt eat a bad thing though, but loke I said, you pay for that privilege! Stop in for a special occasion!
