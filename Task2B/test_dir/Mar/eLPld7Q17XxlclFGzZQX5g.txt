This is not only my favorite "locals" sushi place in Vegas, but anywhere. I am thrilled they opened up more seating because I did not like to wait so long. The food is always amazing -- the prices are great!. . Recommend sending someone early to get your name in! And "All you can eat" is the only way to go!. . Keep it a locals secret!
So far, by far, the best AYCE Sushi joint I have been to. Usually I don't like to order the Maguro because it's usually on the harder side and not good, but here it's soft and tasty! A very good AYCE Sushi experience here at Yama Sushi!
It's a good thing they have AYCE because you literally need to try everything! This place is fantastic. Garlic Tuna, Spicy Seafood Salad, Sun of a Beach are must haves.. And I'm just getting started! Ive been coming here for years and Im pleased to say that it is as wonderful now as it always has been. Best place in town.
As you drive through the large parking lot you can't help but find the huge sign at the top of the building that reads "Sushi" in bright block letters. You are then given the option of eating at the sushi bar or at a dining table, but of course with a smaller group you want the full experience of watching the chefs prepare the sushi in front of your eyes. As you take your seat the friendly chef greats you and asks if you are there for the "All You Can Eat" sushi deal? The answer, for most locals is always yes. The offer is $20 at lunch and $25 at dinner time. If you have any sort of an appetite then you better take advantage of this steal. With individual sushi plates running as high as $12 each, you would be foolish not to go for the big deal. With different assortments of colors and textures you can't predict how your first bite of each plate will taste, but you can count on the consistency of high quality through out the entire meal. If you have the appetite for it, there isa great variety of appetizers and desserts to choose from, all of them are covered by the $25 price. For starters they offer anything from edamame to chicken and rice samplers.  What may be a minor problem for some visitors but to some is a sign of authentication is the thick accents that most of them carry. The language barrier makes the service just that much more fun and entertaining. If you are not patient enough to try your luck with pronouncing the names of these dishes, there are order numbers next to the names on the menu.  The best part of the whole presentation is the effort the chef puts into each and every plate to really allow the food to speak for itself.
Ate here a few months back and seriously there food is excellent!!! Man whore roll is amazinggggggg. The Garlic Tuna is excellent, and there Unagi is very good as well.
Yama sushi is my favorite place for AYCE in town. The prices are perfect and the food is always amazing. I've tried different places, but this is definitely the place I keep coming back to. The specialty rolls are amazing and the seaweed salad is the way to start. Kind of bummed that they limited their mochi to one per person, but the food definitely compensates. Keep in mind that this place is always packed, so expect a wait. Kind of glad they expanded though.
I'm sad to say, I really didn't enjoy most of my visit here. I've had many reccommendations to go here, there was a lot of people waiting, and the amount of reviews are impressive so maybe at one point they were really good but tonight,  I didn't like the majority of the  sushi I tasted..  The service was great, everyone was friendly, all the waitresses made sure drinks were never empty, and Victor at the sushi bar was really nice and attentive. However, the sushi was just not on point. The sun of the beach and wet roll tasted kinda good but each were drenched in delicious spicy mayo and some other sauce. I took the sauce off with by napkin and the sushi was hard to swallow. Fish was really mushy and not too fresh. Super white tuna is one of my favorites usually so I ordered 2 pieces just to try it and the cut was massive, chunky, definitely not melt in your mouth and the ponzu sauce that they drenched it in wasn't even that good. It was mushy and had a weird taste. Overall the sushi taste I would say has been the worst I've had in Vegas. I'm really not trying to sound harsh but I really didn't not enjoy it.. They have many different rolls however if you look closely, they are all very similar. I think I only saw one roll with scallops, I didn't see any impressive sauces, the only different sauce I saw was on the "OH DAM!!!!HENRY" roll. I was iffy to try the green mussels since the grade of sushi had been not too great.. Desert was great but since they don't make it in house, I can't really add another star just cause of ice cream.. Overall, the service is great but sadly the sushi not so much. My favorite is still Kaya Sushi and Goyemon. Sorry Yama Sushi!
We ate here coz one of our friends invited us...alot of people eating thats for sure but my also its because we went sunday night. Food im not so thrill about. The only one I enjoyed is hamacchi kama (grilled fish). Lots of flavor on it. Givin it a star for the great costumer service food wise not so much! .
This use to be the only place I would go for sushi. The costumer service is horrible but I still kept going back because of the food... well let me just say that after trying other sushi places out. this sushi place isn't at all that good. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone especially after the horrible food poisoning I go last time I had it.
The service was great and the food was excellent! I recommend trying this place for AYCE sushi. We tried Makino the night before and I like this place much better. It's a small restaurant so be a little patient when waiting for a table.
Guess what Yelp... I'm Back! I've chosen Yama Sushi to be my first comeback post, mainly because I ate there last night and I realized I never wrote a review for it! There's many different factors that play into the 4 star rating I decided to give Yama. . . First off, the service is particularly fast, but does have it's low points. On multiple occasions, I've put in an order and it never comes out. I either have to cancel it, or remind the staff about it before I end up getting my yummy food. If you read my reviews, you'll know that service is a very big part of how I decide my ratings. . . Secondly, the two main reasons I come to Yama overother sushi places is because of the smoked salmon nigiri and the wet dream roll. I still remember the first time I tried the smoked salmon nigiri.. It melted perfectly in my mouth. Thinking about it now is making my mouth water. The wet dream also has a similar effect on me. It is a unique combinator of flavors and ingredients that leaves you fighting for the last piece. You don't know how many times I've contemplated ordering my own... . The last thing I want to talk about is the quality of the food. Each time I've come to Yama, I feel like the quality of the food was different each time. On some days it looked like they put more emphasis on the presentation and use of ingredients, while other days left me disappointed. Last night in particular, I wasn't too impressed with any of the food I ordered besides the wet dream. . . Yama is a great sushi place in Vegas. If you've never tried any other sushi places in Vegas, be sure to try this one first. While I would come here again, I feel like it's time for me to move on to something new.
I love their seefood salad and rolls, especially no name. Sadly, their nigiri was not as good as their rolls. Too much rice... This place is always busy so you may have to wait for a long time and hard to get quick service, but it is still worth it if you really love rolls.
So I went back to Yama and the service was horrible. The wait staff was not attentive and it almost seemed like we were inconveniencing them by eating at their restaurant. Not cool.
Best sushi ever!!!!! The wait is well worth it... The customer service is hit or miss but the Sushi is hands down the best I've had. This is a bit far from my place but I have yet to find sushi that even compares to Yama and trust me I've tried many others only to be disappointed.
pretty good deal for an all you can eat sushi restaurant.  quality of the seafood was very fresh.
All-you-can-eat lunch?!?!  Yum!. . Located in a shady strip center on Maryland Parkway & Tropicana, your first thought is "why the hell would I get sushi from this place?!"  UM hello- cause it's good!. . Their menu includes items with some crazy and kinda tongue & cheek names which makes it fun for ordering.. . The first time I went with a group of people from my office and the place was PACKED at like noon on a Tuesday.  We ordered all kinds of stuff- all of it delicious!  Wish I could remember which ones I LOVED, ah well, I'll update the next time I go!. . Save room for mochi.  The strawberry is the best, but the vanilla is gross.  Hopefully I will be able to try the ice cream next time.. . I took a co-worker who was in town to Yama and she really enjoyed the sushi too!. . This will be my go-to place when I want something that isn't going to break the bank.  Remember- the place is constantly busy!
Now keep in mind, I was at the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon. The place was super packed, but luckily we missed the big crowds and were seated right away. The sushi itself was pretty tasty, no complaints there. Only issue is how crowded the place was. Two people cannot walk side by side to their table, and its literally a one way road, where you have to make sure no one is coming towards you. The exit was difficult to get to because they had a gentleman sitting right at the corner of the bar, making it so that we had to side step out of there. My husband and I were literally rubbing elbows with a group next to us, which I wouldn't mind, if we weren't sitting next to some loud talking dingus. Again, sushi yummy,  crowd...not so much. :/
After literally getting up and leaving a "modern" sushi joint, which has made me despise the word tapas, we went to Yama Sushi hoping to salvage our dinner date.  For a Monday night this place was full, which was a good sign of tasty things to come.  The wait was quoted at 25 minutes, but it took only 10 to get seated.  Although the all you can eat sushi was tempting, we weren't starving and opted to have 2 special rolls that weren't part of the ayce menu and an appetizer.  I highly recommend ordering the Sun of the Beach roll.  Another highlight was the staff, which was really friendly and attentive during our meal.   I also have a basis that separates good service from great service, which was the refilling of our drinks.  Our cups never went below the halfway mark, which is a bold statement but 100% true.  If you're ever in Vegas and need a sushi fix, this place is a must.
I try to go to Yama Sushi whenever I get a chance to have sushi dates with my best friends. The service is excellent! Doesn't matter if someone isn't ur immediate server, if they are near u, they will ask if u need anything. I love that! The only downfall is that it's so busy on some nights, that there is a long wait period to get seated. It doesn't affect my review tho! I've been to many different sushi places, but this has to be my favorite. From the amazing rolls, to the service, to the atmosphere, this place gets 2 thumbs up from me. My only suggestion is possibly moving the location somewhere else or even expanding business to other areas. Too many instances where there's some crazy person outside yelling obscenities. Haha. Keep up the good work, Yama Sushi! :)
I enjoy coming here for the AYCE they have many options to choose from. For a reasonable price! Sushi is delicious. Wet dream being my favorite! Place is a bit squishy don't really have much privacy. But it's totally worth it! Service is great too. In a very bad area but like I said totally worth it! Thanks Yama sushi!!!
