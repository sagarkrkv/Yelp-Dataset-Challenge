Went in for drinks the other night. 3 drinks = $30. Yikes!
Aside from terrible, dried out, flavorless, & non-creative desserts that do not even come close to reflecting how remarkable the rest of their dishes are, this restaurant is fantastic. Their signature salad is incredible. Their "Persian" drink is wonderful & very refreshing. Great fish dishes & very tender chicken. Not the best acoustics. Very loud restaurant.
I can't believe it took me so long to try this place! The fondue was delish and came with sausage, bread and fresh pears. The pate was so incredible I almost forgot I was eating rabbit. The meatloaf is big enough for two and looks like a decadent dessert. Speaking of dessert, if you don't have room, be sure to take home a bag of bacon pecan brittle. YUM. Everything was perfect from the service to the presentation. Great food. Friendly atmosphere. Amazing value!!
Great place to take a date. Two recommendations- Amaro Meatloaf (food) and Midwest Manhattan (drink). You'll thank me later guys.
I did have so many positives- great chopped salad, excellent flat bread... Service was good, not perfect because..... It sticks in my craw a bit that my entree was inedible. I had the house ground filet/bacon burger. A great idea to add fat to the lean tenderloin,  but the bacon was too salty. I love bacon, and the ratio of fat to meat was right to hold the burger together, but man, taste it first!. I did tell our waiter, and his reply was "yeah I know, and that's without any seasoning".. Wrong answer.. Spending $200 and I get that answer? Not cool.
I've been here twice and always have had a good experience.  Being that there are a bunch of great restaurants in the area, Public House holds it's own, and I'd probably be back again.  This place is great for a quieter nice dinner before a night out for sure.  Sometimes I like to get away from places that are slammed and this place provides that opportunity for that.  It has more of an intimate setting, probably good for dates.. . They do have some nice drink selections but being fashioned after a gastropub, I'd say their beer selection is kind of weak.  But then again, I'm going here for the food, so let's say it's more gastro than pub.. . The food is all good.  Pork Belly Pastrami was amazing and so were the crab cakes, although portions are small, but I expected this.  I've had the meatloaf, which for meatloaf was damn good especially with the glaze.  I'm not really a meatloaf person, but thought it would be good and it was.  Scallops were also very well done.  A friend of mine ordered the mac n' cheese and didn't like it.  I thought she hates everything and tried it and was disappointed.  One might say, yeah but... mac & cheese?  I have had some, like at Smith & Wollensky's, which is unforgettable.  . . The staff has always been great.. . I know I'll be back here. To really go over the top for me I'm looking for something on the menu that I will crave.
This place has been a mainstay of mine for years.  The quality of food and service is always exemplary.  For the price, this place is hard to beat!  My usual is the burrata and/or the chop salad.  Their Manhattans are the best I've ever had!
We popped in for early dinner after catching the Giants v Reds spring training game at Scottsdale stadium. Had the flatbread with hummus and tzatziki dip for a starter and went with the chopped salad and the scallops for our entree's. PB&B for dessert. Everything was fantastic (especially the scallops on that bed of grits), including the service.
Came in with friends for cocktails.  Marian and I tried the Pyrat Eye for $5 each on the happy hour menu. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/citizen-public-house-scottsdale?select=qP8gnrbtP8N9BMaFlGh6vA#qP8gnrbtP8N9BMaFlGh6vA  Others had a Negroni HH special, a glass of pinot noir (half-off during HH), and Boulevardier (also $5 on HH).  I did not really like the dark rum cocktail.  The scent reminded me of rum and coke, which I never cared for when I tried it many, many years ago, and when I took a sip, did not get the satisfying cola taste at all, and instead came away tasting very bitter dark rum.  It certainly wasn't as unpalatable as I make it sound, since I did finish half of it.  I just wasn't a fan.  If you're all about getting drunk fast though, then this might be a drink for you!  Next time, I'll just stick to wine.. . When I felt the buzz coming on after only a few sips, I decided to go with the table bread that everyone had passed on earlier.  This prompted orders of Kiltlifter fondue and bacon popcorn from everyone else-- so happy!!  The cheese fondue paired the best with the toasted cubes of bread, although I skipped on the pear that Chrissy P. was loving!  (Pear doesn't like me very much.)  We all raved about the farmer's sausage from Shannon's (sorry, forgot the whole name).  The spice level was perfect!  Wished there were more slices on the plate!  I skipped on the popcorn (corn allergy), but I did try a sliver of bacon-- it was floppy, not crispy, so I left it on my plate.  The warmed, but not toasted, table bread was good, and paired only with a tiny cup of extra-virgin olive oil.  I was hoping for butter, but the EVOO did have a great, mild flavor with slight buttery notes when consumed with the bread.
My favorite place to grab a cocktail and appetizer at the bar. Food is always good. Chopped salad is amazing!
I got the Truffle Grilled Cheese and it was amazing. Every time I go there, everything is delicious. This is the one place that I know will always be amazing. I've tried the crab cakes, lamb burger and mac and cheese as well and they were delicious as well!
Chopped salad was fun and delicious. The scallops stole the show though! They were cooked perfectly and paired so well with the rest of the dish. Also, try the Citi-Zen cocktail. It was tasty and strong and the rock candy surprise was fun!
I was a solo guest at the bar. I ordered the buttermilk chicken and a beer. 2 beers and a glass of wine later I had a buzz on but no food. 45 minutes went by and still nothing. Guests that sat and ordered after me got their dishes. Staff was cool about it and comped my drinks but something tells me Chef has no clue in the back of the house. I hear he's a Cowboy Ciao alum. Another spot I had a horrible experience at last time I was in town. So I will probably not be making it to Gladys next time I'm back either.
Great service, great mixology, great food and great atmosphere. . . Loved the Beef Belly BLT, Boulvardier, Negroni, Pacific Coast Cocktail
Awesome dinner, awesome service, would come again tomorrow if we could. Chris our server was awesome and his suggestions were spot on. The short ribs and scallops were tasty, chop salad AMAZING!!! Great place
I cannot say enough great things about this place. Its upscale but not stuffy or pretentious and the food is always great! Yesterday was about my 5th time dining here, this time my boyfriend and I sat outside for some cocktails during social hour and snaked on the Bacon heirloom popcorn. Our waiter AJ was awesome! He truly embodied great customer service; knowledgeable about the drinks/menu, friendly, and entertaining. This was supposed to be our last trip here before we move out of state, but because of this last experience we want to go back one more time.. . Last note: Never miss anopportunity to order a chopped salad from here.
A wonderful, delicious respite in Scottsdale.. . Visiting for Spring Training and disappointed by our first night's meal at Papago Brewery, we were excited at the anticipated visit to Citizen Public House. We were not let down. One of those wonderful places that make you struggle to select from a delectable menu, both food and drink. . The cocktail list is inventive and inviting. The New Amsterdam was intoxicating in a good way. Complex and delicious, deftly made with obviously excellent ingredients. The only hiccup was a bespoke order for a Basil Mojito, very simply replacing mint with basil that was made (twice) without any obvious effort to muddle the basil. A disappointment that was removed from the invoice.. The food is spot on, creative and very well thought out. Started with the sublime Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn and intriguing Pork Belly Pastrami. A flavor packed, beguiling, complex offering served over rye spaetzle and brussel sprout sauerkraut. Big and bold but well designed.. Entrees across the table included the Amaro Meatloaf and two Lamb Burgers. The Meatloaf was big, earthy and warming. A generous serving, worth the sporty $20 tariff. the veal demi-glace and mushroom cream delivering a rich arc, while the potatoes and roasted zucchini supplied the ideal sweep for the meatloaf. Lamb burgers were excellent with an exotic compilation of Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion,. tzatziki. Enough so that a request was made to attempt replication at home.. Dessert for the table was the PB&J Pudding Jar. Joyous companions all!. The service was very friendly and attentive while not overpowering, knowing just when to service the table. Excellent.. The space is warm, yet hip and airy, with a very manageable noise level. It was nice, for a change to visit a very popular restaurant that didn't have tables stacked on each other. Very refreshing. . A highly recommended spot for an Old Scottsdale visit..in fact for a destination as well.
My wife had the chopped salad, which she really enjoyed. I had the belly blt which was good but different.  The bacon was a little more chewy than I'm used to. Drinks were good. I had the Citizen and she had the Mule (a vegetable type of adult beverage).  Finally we had the bread pudding dessert which was good. Restaurant was half empty but we were lucky they could squeeze us in without a reservation so I suggest you reserve before you go. Overall an enjoyable experience.
I came here for a friends birthday :) we had a blast. . . Loveeeee this place. Candle lit, dim lights. It's pretty, classy and romantic. Definitely date night place to be..  . Food? Amazing. Chopped salad was delightfu and pretty. I love my truffle cheese sandwich.  It was delicious,  first bite was heaven. Yummm. The gnocchi was alright, I felt like they open a can of tomato can paste and threw it on a plate. . . drinks, The hot pink Paloma was a bit bitter, but thw after taste was perfect. My friend had the sangria, all I taste was the juice. It would be nice if they made it stronger.. . $2 per person to cut OUR cake..... umm yeah. There's three of us. What if we had a huge group?!!?!. -he up sale my entree without telling me, but he comp me.. . I shall come back!!
One of my all time favorite restaurants. WOW the filet mignon was probably the best steak I have ever had.. and this isn't even a steakhouse. The meat was cooked absolutely perfectly and cut like butter. Our waiter waited on us hand and foot. He was delightful and upbeat. We had the gnocchi for an appetizer which was pretty good. The drinks were incredible and would make any mixologist proud. Very interesting yet high quality ingredients were used to make delicious  cocktails. For dessert, my mom absolutely loved the pb and pudding, which is saying something because she's extremely picky. Can't wait to return !
We really liked this place.  We were in Arizona for Spring Training and wanted to try a bunch of local restaurants - we came upon this place on our last night and it was our best meal of the week!. . We had the piggies and waffles as an appetizer - and even though we had chicken and waffles for breakfast, it was quite different and fantastic.  They used cornmeal for the waffle - with syrup to dip it all into - it was quite nice.. . The food is really good here, they also have a lot of interesting drinks and pull a lot of ingredients from local resources.. . The only downside was that it's located in downtown Scottsdale and there are Giants fans everywhere - so if you can handle the smell of those people (heh), it's worth it to check out a place like Citizen Public House.. . By the way - we're A's fans - so they probably enjoyed having some classy gents in there for a change.
This is the second time here over the past year. I ended up ordering good comfort food with the meatloaf dish paired with Yukon potatoes. My girlfriend loved the ribs. The waiter was around alot. He had many suggestions. We took him up on a few. A little loud in the main room but overall an easy place for dinner. They did seem to like to push their cocktails but if you are into that they have some cheap deals earlier in the day for 'happy hour'.
Came for dinner with my girlfriend in the middle of the week. The place was super busy. So had we had drinks at the bar. The drinks was amazing I must say and the bartenders are super nice and professional.. The 2 stars was for the food. This restaurant have everything it takes to be amazing not just because of the good cocktails but mostly the food. You so proud of your chop salad. Israeli style well I'm Israeli and this is far from being close to the taste or to the ingredient . It's not as good as you think. We order lamp that is not cheap at all but I don't care when it's worth it . Well again was so bad!!!!! Hard!!! It wasn't a pies that I would serve in this supposedly 4 start restaurant I was so pissed and hungry . Of course it was too late to order something else . Cuz we waited forever for our table. If the chef serve this lamp like this he is not a chef .. If you guys need advice with food call me :). Citizen amazing stuff amazing atmosphere drinks!!! But bad bad food
I had a confirmed reservation but unfortunately made it (via Yelp) for Wednesday and had intended for Tuesday. When we walked in on Tuesday in March at 6pm there was only 1 table that was occupied by patrons (the place was empty) and the hostess was very rude...she said that she wasn't sure if she could accommodate the 4 of us. Screw her, we left and went to the Herb Box.
loved  everything about this place,  went there two times on my 6 days stay in AZ, my favorite appetizers was Burrata salad and butter squash Gnocchi, my favorite drink was the persian, and you just can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu. Just don't forget to make reservations before going, this place could be even packed on monday nights.
One of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale.  Good food. Great bartenders who make near perfect cocktails, and a great high energy staff.  Try the chicken chopped salad.  Best you'll try. On a weekend, check out their speak easy upstairs.  Great little place to hang out and try some new craft cocktails
Great location, decor, menu, service.
Really, really good all the way around.  From the first moment we were greeted to the moment we left the service was impeccable, the food and drink were top-notch, and the atmosphere is just veryrelaxed and puts you at ease.. . We shared some of the dishes that folks repeatedly mentioned - pork belly pastrami, chopped salad, short ribs, scallops, bread pudding and the pudding jar - all washed down with a couple of kilt lifter ales and a couple of glasses of delicious wines.  Every single bite and sip was great.  Our server, Jeremy, and all the other staff did a wonderful job of pacing things, refilling glasses, etc., and we never felt rushed or neglected.. . A must try if you're in the area.
Enjoyed Every Bite!. . Hubby and I found this place and made a reservation on OpenTable about 45 minutes before we showed up.  We were a bit early... but they sat us right away.. . Kristen our server was super nice and very efficient.. We had a few different people helping us.  And the water guy was ninja-like... our water glasses were never empty.  Thank You, Ninja Water Guy!  We were parched after being in the sun and running around outside most of the day.. . This place is a higher end type of place.. "White table cloth" .... really it's white butcher paper on top of white table cloth.  . The ambience is lively.... kinda noisy in fact.  So, if you are looking for a peaceful, romantic dinner for 2.... go some place else.. . The service and food are top notch.. We were in and out in about an hour... and we never felt rushed nor did we feel like we ever had to wait for anything.. . We ordered a bottle of wine, a salad to share and 2 entrees... our bill with tax and tip was $134.... not cheap... but I felt it was worth the price considering the quality and taste of everything.. . They start you off with bread bites and olive oil.  Good soft bread with really good olive oil that was medium bodied and had a nice flavor to it... not just a regular plain olive oil.  I thought it was a bit earthywith notes of grass and herbs.. . We shared the Chopped Salad and it was just the right size for the 2 of us to start with.  It had Israeli CousCous and pumpkin seeds in it which are different and struck just the right notes to change up an otherwise plain salad into a tasty salad with different dimensions to it.. . I enjoyed the Scallops on a bed of creamy polenta.  I pretty much licked the plate.  The Scallops were succulent and sooooooo good! . . Hubby had the special which was a cashew encrusted halibut.  His too was tasty but the bed of (I think) rice had a spicy kick to it that was good but was just a bit too empowering for me.. . Definitely a nice place to go to for dinner, and I'd put this on our "Let's Go Back Again" list.
