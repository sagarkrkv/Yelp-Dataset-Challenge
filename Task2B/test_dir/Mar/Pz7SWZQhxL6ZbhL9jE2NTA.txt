The Lounge is amazing!. . Floor to ceiling view of Strip, great food and drinks, bathrooms were to die for (will leave that for a surprise), service great...DJ at 1030pm....perfect stop in Vegas!. . For snacks, get the short rib tacos :-). . Simply stunning place...
We stay at Mandalay each year for an annual golf tournament, so MIX lounge is conveniently upstairs. Its definitely not a club like the others along the strip... Just a chill place to grab drinks. The dance floor is small, and pretty much non-existent. The crowd is older... No young hotties. The DJ wasn't that great the last time I was there either.. He didn't know how to transition songs! But the view is great though... Cant get a better view of the strip than from MIX! They also have an open-air balcony if you wanna get some fresh air...
Have been here half a dozen times.  Great place for a quieter dinner.  Most places around Vegas feel like a night club so this is a reliable place where you can take your time eating in a relatively quiet ambiance with a good view.  I haven't had any standout dishes although everything I have had is prepared well and in some cases, interesting.  The desserts are where this place fails.  Not terrible but definitely underwhelming.  The big problem with the desserts is when they are good there just isn't much.
Thankfully we got the free VIP passes they were handing out on the Mandalay Bay floor area so we didn't have to pay cover charge. My boyfriend and I visited this place on a Thursday night - their ladies night, free drinks for ladies until 12 am. The place was filled with middle aged folks. The dance floor had a few women dancing by themselves and the DJ was spinning top 40/hip-hop/mainstream house. The main attraction was the spectacular view from the 64th floor, but only half the balcony was available since the other half was reserved for bottle service. The decor is very cool, all black and modern especially the bar area. We saw them handing out jello shots but unfortunately we didn't get any. Not the hottest spot on the strip but fun if you're there with friends, and definitely more suited for the more mature crowd.
HuhFor starters, if you are terrified of heights DO NOT use the main elevator, its has glass walls and you will poop your pants on the way up. . . This is a review about the restaurant not bar. . . I made reservations for the BF birthday. No wait, even though the place was almost empty, it started to fill up at the end. ANYWAYS, the waitress was a little snobby but I got over that because I am use to that in San Diego. I ordered the lobster salad for starters and it was amazing!!! . . Main course, I had the fois gras, in which, I only brought because its illegal everywhere else, and I had the mac and cheese which tasted awful. The BF had the filet mignon with fois gras that he really enjoyed but the mashed potatoes was a miss. . . So 2 stars for the ambiance. . Another star for the sommelier they have walking around to help you pair the wine to your meal.. And the last star for writing happy birthday in chocolate on my BFs dessert and the delicious cocktails.
Perched atop the 64th floor of the majestic Hotel at Mandalay, Mix boasts some of the best views of the south strip in Vegas. Once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an Alain Ducasse restaurant. The space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the Hotel Plaza Athenee in Paris.  The glitz and glamour of Vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.. . With the beautiful weather I had been  experiencing over the weekend, I opted for patio seating with a direct view of the Vegas strip below. . . After glancing through the menu, I decided  to try Chef Ducasse's signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings.. . Breads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, French baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting "peanut" butter. The breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. . . Amuse. . Foie gras royale with port reduction and mushroom foam . . - this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish. . Gnocci. With Parmigiano Reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.. . Not the best Gnocci I've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. This dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. I especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. Warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. . . Main lobster curry with coconut basmati rice . . - it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. The perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. A delectable marriage of flavors.. . Filet mignon Rossini with foie gras and black truffle sauce . . - this was easily my favorite dish of the night. The combination of filet mignon, foie gras and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  The result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. . . Predessert. . Coconut foam and mango rum cocktail. An exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. Excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.. . Baba a la marnagnac. . Unfortunately I wasn't as impressed with my dessert.. The liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. I may have myself to blame for that, as I may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.. . Overall, food was good but I must admit that I expected more from a multi Michelin star chef like Alain Ducasse.  IMO, the dishes lacked that wow factor that I was eagerly anticipating.  Service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night I dined, as well. For instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until I reminded the sommelier. Additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  The furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. During my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. . With that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  . 3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.. . Until then.... . Happy Eats!
The view of the vegas strip from the 64th floor is breathtaking!! I think it's rare for a place to have great views, great drinks and a great dinner menu! One of my favorites
Preface: my review is only for the lounge and not for the dining experience. . Mix is located at the top of the beautiful THEhotel at Mandalay Bay (soon to be the Delano). Mix, both the restaurant and the lounge, are absolutely beautiful. I brought my friend out for his birthday as I wanted to give him a unique experience. He was blown away by how beautiful both the restaurant and the lounge were. The view is spectacular, and there is seating right up at the windows overlooking the Strip. . . As for the drinks: we were disappointed that thecocktail menu seemed a bit boring. I had the Champagne Cocktail. It was light and pleasant, but not something I would return for. My guest had an Old Fashioned and it was a bit sweet for his tastes. Whiskey offerings were limited, but suitable. We enjoyed the ambiance though. The weren't playing "dance-y" music (I don't want to call it exactly EDM, but you know what I'm talking about). It was a good mix of jams, no top 40 and appropriate for the atmosphere.. . We arrived at 8 pm and really enjoyed the environment. However, as the night went on, the DJ started to play the aforementioned "dance-y" music. Not really our thing, but what made it worse is that no one was dancing. The crowd is a diverse mix of younger guests and older guests (40+). It looked like the conversing type of crowd, and not a dancing kind of crowd. The music really killed the mood. It also felt absurd that it was linked to such a beautiful and elegant dining establishment as well. The upside to all of this is that everyone started to drink more, and it was fun to people watch.. . Would definitely come back for a dining experience, but I probably won't make it back to the lounge unless there are some changes when the Delano brand takes over for THEhotel.
In a word: Phenomenal!. . In the pretense of celebrating a birthday/anniversary, we went to the top of theHotel at Mandalay Bay to have dinner at MIX; it was a fantastic decision!  The ambiance was perfect for the evening with balcony seating with the cool evening air venturing in.. . The food, although on the pricey side, was exquisite.  I had the braised wagyu which was tender and flavorful as can be!. . Our server, Randy, was superb!  He was very knowledgeable of the menu and his charisma definitely added to the evening.  The service even brought out fresh madeleines decorated for our special occasion.. . Bottom line: we will definitely be visiting this establishment again and will make sure to venture also into the lounge area next time.
Awesome place to come for a drink and enjoy the magnificent view, but I can't recommend trying to make a night out here. We got to the lounge around 9:30 on a Friday night and there awesomely was no cover (and no cover for our husbands who got there around 11) and lots of seating with a view available. The view is awesome, with a wonderful panorama of the strip. The cocktail menu was ok but the drinks were a little too sweet. I couldn't stomach more than one and switched to beer. If you're seated away from the dance floor, the volume of music is not too loud which is great for being able to have a conversation. I just didn't love the mix of music. I think it's probably for people younger than me (and I'm under 30) based on the (few) people out on the dance floor. I did go up to the DJ to request some other music, and he said the establishment frowns upon playing hip hop music...but he did oblige us with some Biggie, 50 cent, and Dr Dre. As soon as he stopped playing that short little set it went back to Techno/Dance (I think? I don't even know how to classify the music), and we jetted out of there to catch the last 12:30 tram. If the music had been more my tune I would have loved to dance on top of Vegas all night.
We were in town for a company sales meeting and one of our colleagues suggested we go over to Mix. We went later in the evening and did not eat.  When we got there, we could notbelieve the views.  Since our group was large we ordered the bottle service, highly recommend to large groups of people.  Later in the evening our party moved by the dance floor and our server that helped us then was Ganette.  She was so helpful.  It's not a very busy dance floor but the music was great and we danced anyway. Overall we had a lot of fun and recommend to anyone to go check it out at least before they head out for the night.  Ladies be sure to use the restrooms, views are awesome in there too. I only wish there was a little more light  at the sinks, it would be nice to see yourself in the mirror. Also, be sure to ask for Ganette to be your server.
