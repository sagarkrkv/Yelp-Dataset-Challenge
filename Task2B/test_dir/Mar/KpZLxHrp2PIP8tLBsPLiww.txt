The getaway place in Vegas.. . Nice, clean and modern.  Spacious all suites with in room fridge, stove, microwave, etc.  And whirlpool tub in the room.  Friendly staff to boot.. . Although the hotel only had one small restaurant, the lounge area is good for a late night drink.  Also, it's only a short (few minutes) walkway to all the buzz in MGM Grand.. . One thing that I was a little annoyed about, is that they block off Taxi drop off to tower 1 (where we stayed) before midnight, so you have to walk a bit (either through tower 2 corridor or through not so well lit outdoor area).  It's not much of an inconvenience, but it is Vegas and a lux hotel...  Just a little odd why they would do that.. . If you want 24x7 access to everything happening, then this may not be your cup of tea (me).  When you are finished with the highs of Vegas and want some place that you can relax, the Signature is perfect for you(wife).
I really don't want to put a two stars! I honestly like to room but I thought I would experienced better. . . We head to tower one because they stated that was where our room was, we spoke with the reception guy there and told that the room we book didn't have a balcony and we book for three days. That was wrong because my boyfriend cancel that reservation and book the balcony suite for TWO days. . . He then MADE my boyfriend look for the confirmation number, he never bother to check. So when my boyfriend finally pull it up he still couldn't' find it. My cousin who wasfrom Vegas had to wait an extra HOUR and something for us at the restaurant because of this issue. After some phone calls the issue was " kind of resolved "  and we had to walk to tower two for our room. We were in a rush, and had to wait for our bags to come up. It took FOREVER that we had to call in TWICE and finally behold the bags are here. We rush out, and waited for valet which took about another 15 minutes.  . . If you guys booked from a third party PREPARE to wait longer than usual!   . . The room as very nice! I like it except for the door for the bathroom that NEVER NEVER close. I didn't mind since it was me and my boyfriend but if I had friends over it would bother us. The rob I used smell SOUR......
love staying here. very clean and very comfortable. just a thing to remember when coming here. no smoking allowed and there are no tables or slots for gambling.
Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful and clean hotel with lots of space and amenities. But what's the point of having a full kitchen and champagne bottles in the room if we aren't also given any glasses, plates, silverware, or at the very least, champagne flutes? The room came stocked with about 8 bottles of champagne that we could purchase for $30 each, but we had to order champagne flutes from room service (for $1 each). Not ideal to have to wait for flutes to be delivered...maybe this is just the way hotels in vegas are though? We were only there for two nights, so didn't like finding out that we had  to order flutes and wait for them, AFTER we had already opened up a bottle. Pretty annoying.. . Another thing we didn't like was that we weren't given the opportunity to request a particular tower. So, we ended up in tower 3, which is the tower that's farthest away from the strip. Also, tower 3's pool is only open on the weekends, so when we wanted to take a dip we had to walk to another tower. Would have preferred to stay in Tower 1 or 2.. . We booked a balcony room which was cool, but it overlooked the airport so was not a great view during the day. The view at night was better though. Also enjoyed the smoke-free lobby of the tower.. . All in all, not bad. But next time I think we'll either stay at another hotel closer to the strip, or we'll stay at MGM Grand instead one of the signature towers.
Had a great stay. The room was big and comfortable and the pools were perfect for relaxing ( not over crowded at all) if we were going to bring our kid with us this is where we stay. It's not full of smoke and it's close to a bunch of shops and activities.  For us this trip was about relaxing and the signature was the perfect place for that. The staff was helpful and friendly and got us anything we needed. . . We ate room service several times. The food was quick and delicious especially the herb roasted chicken meal. The chicken soup was much bigger then expected and like I said room service was about the same price as of we had gone out to eat somewhere just much more convenient.
I love this place and never want to leave it while I'm here. From the bed to the jacuzzi tub this is my zen. . I love having the flat screen facing the tub so I can watch what ever while I soak in suds after a usually lovely night. . The bed is better then home comfort. . .  Who ever said there's no place like home obviously haven't stayed here.. . The people at the front desk are super lovely people and friendly. . . I highly recommend staying here at least once.
Absolutely loved it! We stayed in tower 3. We originally got a regular suite and were upgraded to a one bedroom because they were full! Soooo nice! . . There was a comfy king sized bed along with a couch that converts into a queen sized. Extra blankets inside one of many closets!. . Two bathrooms which was very convenient for all of us! One of them was a basic bathroom, Both had a shower and the master one had a jacuzzi tub. The master bathroom also had two huge mirrors and counter space for stuff. . . In the suite we also had a kitchen with different appliances such as blender, coffee machine, microwave, two door fridge, and a counter. Drinks inside but no cups:/ . . Our balcony had an amazing view. The hotel also has a fitness room with all types of equipment. Overall Very spacious and accommodating. Will definitely be back! Oh look out for groupon deals for this place!!!
Stayed here last year in November! We stayed a week and everything was great!! The bed was super comfortable and clean. The room had two bathrooms and a kitchen. We had view of the strip which was really nice at night. Our tower also had Starbucks downstairs which was great. I did not mind the walk to the strip since i enjoy walking everywhere. I would stay here again!
