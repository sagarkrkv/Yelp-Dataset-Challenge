Mesa Grill was very good however it wasn't mind blowing. I expected to be whisked away to some amazingly delicious Iron Chef Bobby Flay land, alas I was not. I had the Lamb Porterhouse with Tamale and sides of Spinach and Sweet Potatoes. All was delicious - we first sat at the bar to wait for table. Bad thing no draught beers here - only bottles. The bartender handed us breadsticks, which had a nice spicy element. After a 45 minute wait, we finally were taken to our table. The waiter was nice however did not give us the lowdown on the fare, as a typical establishment of this type is expected to - maybe he was too busy?  When the food arrived, the lamb was cooked a little under, however seasoned well and had a nice spicy kick from the serrano peppers on top. The sweet poatatoes were sweet and had a nice firm bite, not hard or raw. The spinach also was good.. . Overall the food was good but not impressive as you would an Iron Chef restaurant to be.
This restaurant is not southern.  I was expecting some gumbo or jumbalaya and got some sort of mesh of favors that were hit and miss.  It is not so much a restaurant as it is a chemistry experiment.  The dishes here that are good are interesting combinations of favors I haven't had before.  Because this restaurant seems to me just an experiment to test people's tolerance for someone's best idea for a crazy chem-lab you'll have to go to try for yourself.. . It isn't southern anything.  It is lunar.
Had another amazing meal here on my latest trip to Vegas. Definitely recommend the ahi nachos, filet and pork tenderloin. I'm not sure what the sauce is on the pork but it was one of the best entrees that I have ever had. I love love love this place and always try to get a meal in here whenever I'm in town.
Tried it as part of Restaurant Week kickoff and we were pleasantly surprised by the food. Ordinarily we steer away from any celebrity-named restaurant but quality was terrific as was the service. Reservations are a must. We split the blue tortilla duck and shrimp tamale appetizers, which were quite good. We both ordered the coffee-coated tenderloin, which turned out to be fork-tender and a slight but pleasant kick from the ancho sauce. Desserts were nothing to write home about; the chocolate pudding tasted like something from out of the can and the coconut cake definitely had been baked earlier in the week, frozen and then thawed for the weekend rush. We'll probably go back for a special occasion - it's a bit pricey; our waiter said Mondays tend to be the best night, less crowded. It's also very very noisy and you're elbow to elbow with the next table, very reminiscent of New York City restaurants.
Was looking forward to eating at Mesa Grill, have yet to try Bobby Flay's dishes. Unfortunately (or fortunately) I've been eating a lot of food in Vegas, so I was decidedly un-hungry when I arrivedfor lunch. . . I figured a margarita would help open the palate. For the premium margaritas you choose the tequila and they add lime juice and triple sec. I chose Gran Centenario Anejo, and the result was amazing. Lots of tangy lime juice, keeping it refreshing and not at all syrupy. . . I ordered the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad, and it was amazing. The presentation was so beautiful I was compelled to try it, even though my stomach was threatening me with possible mutiny. . . One bite and I was hooked. The chicken was cooked perfectly, very tender and the seasoning packed a punch without going overboard. Swirled in the green onion vinaigrette, it was the perfect blend of charred grill flavor, mild sweetness and tangy boldness. I devoured the whole thing.
During a Bachelorette weekend, one of the girls in our party hooked our group into coming here for lunch to experience what she dubbed a "life changing burger." As the token vegan of the group, I was apprehensive on what I'd be able to eat.. . Enter the Brussels Sprouts Salad!. . Let's start by taking a look at it... http://bit.ly/1kN3ySz Pretty, right? Shaved brussels sprouts mixed with thinly sliced gala apples and pomegranate pearls. The Spicy Tangerine Vinaigrette had some kick to it. This usually comes with goat cheese but I think it's very tasty without it. Pretty filling too and totally perfect after a night of drinking.. . As for the "life changing burger," I heard no complaints from our table.. . Btw, the bread basket looked pretty amazing. It was filled with mini muffins and baked goods, both sweet and savory. While I didn't partake, the other ladies in the group were raving about it.
Good food but so expensive comparing . For the food they serve, the service is great the margaritas need to be better although they said it was made from scratch but didn't buy that
Skip this place, no really, skip it.  The margaritas are okay, but the food is sub par, especially for a town like Vegas.  . . Went there for restaurant week and my friend ordered the shrimp tacos.  Usually when you order a taco plate at a restaurant they list how many comes with it.  Mesa didn't and I had a funny feeling about it, like there would only be 2 instead of 3 which you find at most places.  . . Not only was I right to be suspicious about that, but when they came out she had to put them together herself.  It was like someone threw the ingredients on a plate, after they were cooked, and expected the diner to put them together.  Really?. . I ordered the burger, and it was okay, but at $16 I've had burgers for half the price be twice as good a countless number of times.  . . Mesa, the only bad restaurant in Caesar's, don't go if you don't have to.
Absolutely the best meal we had in Las Vegas.  The food was flavorful, and the service was impeccable.  If you are in Vegas, making the trip through the maze in Caesars Palace to find Mesa Grill is 100% worth it.. . My husband had the coffee encrusted filet mignon with a side of spiced sweet potatoes.  He swears it was probably the best steak he has ever had! (This from Mr. "Always orders the steak"). I wasn't as hungry, so I opted for an appetizer.  I thoroughly enjoyed the tiger prawns, roasted garlic tamale, and cilantro sauce.. . The food was amazing at the tables on either side of us as well - we could hear them exclaiming about it!  . . As good as the food was - the service managed to equal it.  I've never had my water refilled so often, the waitress be so knowledgable (we had wine questions), or the bus boys be so efficient.  Amazing, and all without ever feeling like someone was hovering over our table.. . Go to the Mesa Grill.  Even if Bobby Flay didn't personally cook our meal, the people there on a daily basis are infinitely qualified!
Terrible disappointment.  It was a special celebration. We had reservations, and still had to wait for 30 minutes for a table, just to be seated right next to the kitchen doors.  Ah, no.  Asked for another table, ended up waiting for another 30 minutes, followed by a snarky comment from one of the Hostesses "Don't they know they are at the Mesa Grill"?  Really?   Finally got another table just be ignored by a lazy waiter. Ordered a bowl of black bean soup, that may have been better had it been warm. SO WE LEFT.  Never again Bobby Flay.  Your restaurant and your employees are not worth the time or our hard earned dollar.
I am a local so I have been here several times . . . Always love - love - love the food, especially the pork tenderloin.  My husband and I went there a week or so ago before attending Absinthe (also great).  In a rare moment I decided to go for the stuffed poblano Chile...OMG. . .This sucker was stuffed with eggplant. . .cheese - dusted with cornmean. . .before cooking. . .It might be the best vegetarian mean I have ever had.  My only suggestion would be to add something to the plate.  Some little side of rice or maybe a small piece of corn bread.  You are only served one (large) but it is kinds of lonely on the plate.  Hubby got salmon . . . he thoroughly enjoyed his mean as well.. . This place is always crowded so make a reservation . . . The staff was aware that we had a show reservation and made every effort to accommodate our schedule even suggesting a back door exit to be nearer to the theater entrance.  . . Mesa Grill has been at Caesars for a long time. It is consistently excellent.  I have seen many "glamour chefs" open and close restaurants on the Strip. . Not so with Bobby Flay and the Mesa Grill.
Pretty good but overpriced.. . I was looking forward to eating at Mesa but left disappointed. Nothing went wrong. I just expected better. Service was great. Nice ambiance inside. Its easy to forget you're in the middle of a casino. However, the meal itself just didn't measure up to my expectations. Yeah it's in Vegas & owned by a celebrity chef so we expected to spend a few hundred dollars but we also expected it the be a great meal. It wasn't. I'd say somewhere between okay and pretty good but by no means great. Of the dishes that I remember.... . APPETIZERS. Bread Basket - not an app but still worth mentioning. it's full of different kinds of bread and the jalapeno cheese corn bread it good. grab it before someone else at your table does. . Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ Duck - pretty good. the BBQ sauce carried most of the flavor and you couldn't taste the duck. still pretty good though.. Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale - good flavor combinations. proly my favorite item overall. kinda small though. Looking at the name I was thinking they were serving Tiger Prawn but these are just regular-ass scrimps. . Tuna Nachos - Meh. pretty creative but didn't come with a lot of flavor. . ENTREES. Filet - filet was good but I wouldn't put it in my top 5 & considering it was $50, I feel like it really should have been better. The temperature was right on the money but it was just missing something. . Grilled Chicken - i thought grilled chicken would be way to boring for a Bobby Flay restaurant but it's on the menu. It's exactly what you think it is...grilled chicken. It was juicy but again nothing to get excited about. . Pan Seared Sea Scallops - These were actually pretty good.. . I also ordered 2 margaritas and they were on par with everything else...so so. I really wanted to luv this place but the items we tried just didn't live up to the hype. Would I eat there again? Maybe for lunch. Dinner wasn't worth $325 for 4 ppl in my opinion.
We walked in with out a reservation and the hostess was so gracious and found us a seat on a busy night. The restaurant is beautiful and very clean, they layout fresh linens after tables clear. We ordered our meal and told the server that we would be sharing our meals with each other. He brought us extra plates and when our Filet came out they had cut it in half for us. Food was amazing! We had the Sophie's Chopped Salad, the Chili Relleno, and the Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon. We also part took in the libations. I had the Saratoga and my sis got the Mesa Grill Margarita, both were well rounded drinks made with excellent liquor. . Good Job Bobby Flay! One of our new favorites in Las Vegas.
I had an excellent experience at Mesa. The service was quick, the server was knowledgeable, making some excellent recommendations --try the blue pancake and tiger shrimp. The margaritas were superb and my lamb was cooked perfectly and was full of flavor and heat. . . Vegas restaurants, especially celebrity restaurants are overrated and after being disappointed at Thomas Keller's Bouchon at the Venetian, Mesa Grill was a welcome surprise. Recommended!
I don't LOVE Mesa Grill, it would be more accurate to say I am  IN LOVE with Mesa Grill. I have been 15-20 times over the last 5 years and had just about everything on the menu. Perhaps because of this the negative reviews sort of infuriate me. Mesa Grill is not Chilis- yes they both proclaim to offer great southwestern food but Mesa Grill is a big girl restaurant- they don't serve southwest egg rolls or big mouth bites. They don't have a 20 page long menu with 5,000 items on it. Food costs more than 4.99 during happy hour. These shouldn't be controversial facts but apparently they are enough to justify a negative rating. There needs to be some sort of basic restaurant literacy exam you take before you can post reviews on yelp. Wait, hold on, did negative yelp reviews just turn me into a tea party republican? Ruh roh..... . . Drinks. Regular margarita- I know a lot of people don't like to get adventerous with their drinks and if that is the case you can't go wrong with the house margarita- it is not as sweet as you may be used to with many places now putting agave nectar in their drinks but it is not face puckeringly bitter. . . Cactus Pear - this is the best by far. Yes it is pink, that doesn't mean it isn't manly. . . . Appetizers- in Order. . Blue Corn Lobster Tacos- Winner. These are so frigging good its ludicrous. I normally don't like relish, fennel or hananero and yet I love this relish. . . Blue Corn pancake- comes with tasty duck meat and a slightly spicy sauce. . Chicken Black Bean Quesadilla- the garlic sauce that comes on this is slightly more addictive than heroin. . . Goat Cheese Queso- its not quite dippable queso but is also not actual gross fundido- pretty tasty. . . . Entres- In order. . Pork Tenderloin- this one is always on the restaurant week menu so I have had more than my fair share of it. it is super delicious. It comes with three different sauces on the plate (for three pieces of tenderloin) and they are all good. It also comes with a sweet potato tamale thing that is amazing.. . Veal Chop- I don't like horseradich so I get it without- other than that this dish is perfect. I think the tamale is cheese (goat cheese?) - I'm not really sure because I inhaled it before I could figure it out. . . Bone in Ribeye- this is an outstanding steak for a non steak restaurant. Its like 50 bucks- less than you would pay at Carne Vino and the like. It has a really good smoky glaze on it so if you are a steak purist (only want meat taste) this is probablynot for you. . . Side Dishes- In order. . Sweet potato Gratin. Twice baked potato. . Desert. This changes a lot- the churros and any pie I have had have all been top notch.
I LOVE BOBBY FLAY. I seriously got an allergy attack here and I STILL love it. (I don't know what ingredient I was allergic to but that's my own fault. I refuse to blame Bobby Flay for it because I adore him.) . . The bartender was really friendly and she kept raving about how much she loved working for BF. . . I had the ahi tuna "nachos" with these amazingly delicious puff nachos. I also had the butternut squash or pumpkin soup which I devoured like a mad woman. Thepeach margarita was delectable! . . I'd definitely return!
I'm in town for Cinema con and tried to make a reservation here for 12 people.  I was told they could do 8 and 4, but couldn't put the tables together.  Nothing I could do so I took them.  When we arrived I asked again about putting tables together and was told no.  8 of us were in the private dining where there were 5 tables of 8 and our 8 were the only people in there!  All the other tables remained empty the whole time we were dining and my other 4 guests had to sit in the dining room! Come on folks, does this make any sense??
We visited Mesa Grill during restaurant week before Celine Dion concert, It is right next to the Colosseum, so perfect for a nice not rushed meal prior to the performance. . . I had the cactus pear margarita, shrimp and corn tamale, Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon and Trio Of Sorbet. . . The shrimp and corn tamales was me given a shot at faith. I had always disliked tamales because of some certain flavor that I always tasted, but I gave it a shot with the limited selection of restaurant week. It was AMAZING. The corn tamale was creamy and more corn flavored than anything. The shrimps were juicy and chewy.. . The next is the coffee rubbed filet mignon. I don't normally use all capital, but this dish deserve all capital. It was DELICIOUS!! The filet mignon is cooked to perfection. Even though the chef slice is through the middle making it like sandwich for some weird reason. Never had it served that way. I'm still savoring the taste. A definitely must order there.. . The trio of sorbet consisted of cactus, coconut and mango. I was expecting a more slushie texture sorbet like it usually is. I was pleasantly surprised that it was thick and creamy. When I was eating the mango, I was overwhelmed with spiciness. Apparently it was mango with cayenne pepper. Immediately eating the coconut after definitely soothes it. Give it a try!
My husband made it a point to come here before we left Vegas earlier this month. We were here on a Sunday morning for brunch and Bobby Flay did not disappoint one bit! The menu was spot on and uncomplicated. I love that especially when I'm at one of these celebrity Chef restaurants, I want to try everything so keeping it simple for me is a good thing.. . Run down:. . Goat Cheese Queso Fundido. Crispy Bacon Hash Brown Quesadilla. BBQ Lamb Cobb Salad. Green Chile Cheese Burger. . OMG, none of these disappointed and we left feeling stuffed but not greasy and disgusting like at some other places. The food was fresh and outstanding! . . When we're back in Vegas we will have to try the dinner menu.
Very good food, and great service!. . The waiter was really nice and helpful, when we didn't know what we wanted exactly he gave us really good suggestions that we ended up following. His suggestions were great because I had no complaints about the food and the food was amazing.. . For an appetizer we had the Garlic Shrimp Tamale. It was delicious, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and the sauce went so well with the shrimp. Also the tamale really went with the shrimp.. . We had 4 things, the Pork Tenderloin, Veal chop, Lamb chop and the roasted Brussels sprout salad . The Pork tenderloin was very soft and the sauce went well with it. I also liked how all the meat dishes came with a tamale, each with a different taste to go with it. It's been a quite a while since I ate at Mesa grill so I forgot what went with the Pork Tenderloin, I think it was a sweet Tamale. The Veal chop was so moist and soft. The ratio of fat to meat was perfect. The reason I really liked the Veal chop was that it was really juicy, but the juices don't flow out of the meat, but instead stay in the chop. I think the tamale I got with the Veal chop was a cheesy one. The Lamb chop was also really good, which is saying something as I don't normally like the taste of lamb. The brussel sprout salad was also delicious. The brussel sprouts were perfectly charred, and the pomegranates added a nice sweet touch.. . I highly recommend eating here
Pricey but a wonderful spot for brunch on the Vegas Strip. The location is also great for the boys when theres a big game -- grab a good seat in the middle of the main glass dining area and they can view and cheer along to all the TV's in the surrounding Caesars Sports Book.. . Menu is a bit small/limited and mimosas add up at a pricey $12 a flute, but their tiger shrimp tamale and spicy chicken sweet potato hash has me looking forward to coming back to give their full dinner menu a try. Bobby Flay's flavors are spot-on and worth a visit/return; plus the complimentary varietal bread basket is also a lovely touch.
The server is really nice,  he was very accommodating to dietary restrictions, which I really appreciated.  My main concern was that the food was more spicy then I would have liked...it was good but the spicy made it hard to eat enjoyably. Bread basket rocked...I actually came here because it was highly recommended to me.
Appetizers: Lobster tacos and Tiger Shrimp Tamale -- both outstanding. . Entrees: The pork tenderloin was the most tender and flavorful pork we've ever had, while the grilled chicken had a spicy, tangy sauce on it that I am still dreaming about. It was such an interesting flavor.. Sides: The brussels sprouts were delicious!. . Bobby Flay definitely did not disappoint. Overall an amazing and very worthwhile meal!
Sit at the bar. You get free amazing spicy pretzel breadsticks that are TO DIE FOR.. . Oh that bread basket... still the best.. . Got Chile Relleno. One of the best things I have ever tasted in my life.. Tuna steak was DELISH.. . Seriously.. so good.. . Dinner portions are pricey and were smaller than lunch. I suggest lunch time and a bar seat if you can.. . Foodies, you MUST eat at Mesa. Bobby, you must marry me and cook for me.
My friends and I hit this place up last week and I must say, hands down one of the best meals I have ever had, try the duck, steak and mahi!!!!!
