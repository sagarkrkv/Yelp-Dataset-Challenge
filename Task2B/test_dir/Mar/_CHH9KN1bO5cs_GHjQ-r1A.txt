Chocolate wasteedddd! Lol. fun fun fun place for a couple or family. Enjoy wonderful dessert cocktails or fondue with your love ones. delicious shakes too. Friendly staff but needs refinement in service and product knowledge. Even the manager had no clue what I was eating but after you dip into that chocolate and take that first bite...can't feel nothing but happy. max brenner you bald genius ! Can't wait to go back.
I have to say that this was the absolute worst service I have ever received. As someone who used to work in the restaurant industry, I am very lenient to servers who may take a long time to get back to the table or who may seem a little stressed. However, Ferdinan at Max Brenner had to be the worst server I have ever had. . . I knew we were in for an interesting dining experience when I ordered an IPA and he didn't know what that was. The rest of the meal was filled with awkward comments, and him reading over my friends' shoulders when they were on their phones. At the end of the meal, he did apologize for the bad service and said the restaurant was closing in April, so they were short staffed. Let's just say we were less than shocked. . . When we left the restaurant, my friend made a comment to the hostesses about the service we had received, and both of them looked at her and simply replied, "okay." I have never complained to somebody at a restaurant about my service before, but I would expect them to at least express some sort of apology. . . Anyways, the food was alright- nothing to write home about. I will say the chocolate dishes looked fantastic, but it's safe to say that I won't be coming back to try those.
Love this place. I've only eaten desserts though. Too bad they will be closing. Make sure to check them out before! Any of the fondue is great and have great happy hours at the bar.
Heads up people, from what we heard, this wonderful place will be closed within thirty days.  It seems Ceasers is raising their rent so high they cannot stay.  Apparently they are targeting three businesses within the forum shops.  Such a shame.  This place is cool, it has a funky vibe, good service, great food, and the desserts?  Well let's just say if you like chocolate, run over there now, it is open late.  The only thing that can keep me warm at night is the idea that I can stop in there and maybe grab some retail half off.  Still it is such a shame!
Ugh god. Are tourists just over generous with reviews bc this place is bland, over priced and typical. Save your money and leave. Best part was walking away
I am a chocoholic and this place is like heaven to me! lol I went here twice, and I hope to stop by again. The last time I've been here was with my family and boyfriend. We ordered some shakes and of course one of their chocolate fondues. For the shakes, we ordered strawberry white chocolate, chocolate hazelnut, and cookies shake. I can't decide between strawberry and hazelnut. They were both so so goood!! The cookies and cream was alright, I just wish they had more cookies. The fondue was amazing of course. We had the Classic European Fondue for Two. I think we had three little fondue pots with dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and toffee. So goooooood!!! Just thinking about it makes me want it now! lol. . And of course the service is great, the waiters are patient and down to earth (they don't seem like they're trying too hard). So if you want your chocolate fix go here!! It'll hit the spot!
I've never spent $14 on a dessert before so expectations were high as they should be for this high of a price.  What a major disappointment.  Let's start with the shake.  My son ordered the salted caramel shake & it was the most runny, thin shake I've ever tasted.  Also way too salty.  Portion was very small.  For $9 you should get a nice sized shake with the tin can.  On to my banana split waffle.  Let's start w/the positives - the chocolate & caramel was outstanding.  The problem the chocolate comes in a container that probably holds 1/2 an ounce if your lucky.  This is stingier than your boss giving you praise for a job well done.  Then they put a 1 1/2 inch baby scoop of ice cream that is smaller than a child's cone at baskin robbins.  To make matters worse the waffle is so stale it tastes like it was made in the dark ages.  Seriously this place is averaging 4 stars?  I wouldn't go back unless someone's buying & even them I'd think twice.  Major bummer!
At first glance, whether looking at the names of dishes, or glancing over to their chocolate section, we thought the place reminded us of an elegant, chocolatey, Willy Wonka shop. There are two sides to the store. The first is where you dine and on the opposite side are all their confections. . . I did the unthinkable and ordered the Deep Blue Cobb Salad. I wasn't feeling very well so I wanted something as light as possible. It was decadent with the bleu cheese and bacon, but the salad wasn't big at all, so the flavors weren't overwhelming. It was a good salad but I'll try to never order a salad from here again. . . My fiance went the sweet breakfast route and ordered the After Party Belgian Waffle. The waffle was cooked well but it consisted of two small waffles covered in whipped cream and strawberries. In two little mini beakers were the melted white chocolate and strawberry honey. It tastes like a creamy strawberry syrup and the white chocolate was good. . . The next time we visit, I said we'd have to try the Chocolate Fondue. A few people ordered it to share and it looked amazing. I'd suggest going out of your comfort zone in a place like this. . . We also ordered milkshakes and when you see the prices on these things, you might remember the $5 milkshake scene in Pulp Fiction. Well, these were $8 milkshakes so they better be good. I got the 80s milkshake and it was really boring. He got the Chocolate Espresso milkshake and the flavors were much better, although I didn't taste much of the espresso in there. They weren't worth the price, in my opinion, as our tastebuds didn't receive a blast of excitement as we expected, but they were tasty. We might split one if we decide to try them again. Even Sugar Factory's ice cream concoctions were more creative and comparable in price. Toward the end, my fiance also ordered an Americano with an extra shot and I remember him enjoying it. Before tip, our total cost $53.89 and it was pricey. The $15 salad wasn't worth it and I feel like you have to go big or go home otherwise you might be disappointed. . . On the other side, the chocolate shop is small and sometimes cramped. There is a chocolate twist in all of their treats. Chocolate is their thing. The waitress even gave us a 10% off coupon to use so we found it difficult to pass up buying several things we wanted including their variety box. The only thing that stopped us was our drive back to LA. Being that we were in July and the average day in Vegas was 110 degrees, we decided against it. Another time, we told ourselves.
This establishment never ceases to amaze me and take my palate to  new and delicious experiences!  Service was wonderful, even the tea is wonderful!  I will come here everything I'm in Vegas!
Fantastic food! I got the Brenner Burger and my wife got the Prosciutto Waffle Sandwich. Both were delicious. But, I think my favorite part of the meal was the drink. I got the Yellow Granitas, which was amazing. The sad part is that this location is closing for good in two weeks. Hopefully they reopen somewhere else in Vegas, because I'll definitely come back if they do.
I'm going to start a list called, "Over-hyped Over-Yelped Places" and the top of my list will be Max Brenner. . . It was early Sat. morning when we came here. I was groggy and hung-over from the night before (ugh, two-buck chuck's are the worst hangovers, EVER). I tried to read through their confusing menu, but it required too many brain cells, so I left all the ordering to Mike (who has several degrees and credentials in breakfastology, really). Good thing I didn't order because I didn't realize the prices till I came home. We ordered the $10 chocolate cookie, an $8 milkshake and $12 corn croquettes. "Woah Elly May, didn't you know you ain't in West Virginia no mo'?" Yeah... obviously. Poor uncle Jed would've died of a heart attack here. Good thing he wasn't with us. . . Anyways... I didn't have any price prejudice when the food came out. I just didn't think it was spectacular. At all. The $8 salted caramel milkshake tasted like liquid Snickers, way too sweet. The chocolate chip cookie was thick, not crispy, and I didn't like it. It was like a cookie cake, yuck. We got their Cinnamon Apples & White Chocolate Cream French Toast. I thought it was blah, but Mike, the expert on all things french toast, said it was good. The only highlight for me was the side of bacon, it was excellent. . . Ok, ok, so Max Brenner was my idea. I can't blame anyone. "It's a restaurant dedicated to chocolate! How can that go wrong?" I thought. Well... for starters, 90% of their menu is sweet, so if you're a recovering diabetic, this place is not for you.. . I did notice how run-down the place looked. Our table had chips and dents. The varnish was coming off on the wood, the chairs were uncomfortable. Service was barely decent, but she was nice. Again, for the price point, this is unacceptable.. . Sorry, but I'm  a disappointing 0-2 with Forum Shop restaurants. The first bomb was Planet Hollywood, which I never wrote a review for, because c'mon, what foodie eats at Planet Hollywood? Shhhh.... . . According to Ben L's review below and other unconfirmed sources, this place will be closing down at the end of the month when their lease is over. I suspect, since the store was hopping at 1030am, they will be opening elsewhere, just not at the Forum Shops. So don't fret chocolate lovers, you can still have your sugar-induced coma! But as for me, I'll pass. And my pancreas will thank me for it.
I came here last night with my boyfriend, it was our anniversary so in the reservation I had requested a secluded table. The hostess seemed to entirely disregard our request and seated us right next to a large party. . . Then the service was rather slow. We ordered ONE burger to split and it felt like FOREVER. However, that burger was AMAZING. It was one of the best I've had in a long time. The fries on the side were rather cold as if they were sitting out for awhile.. . After the main course we had ordered the main fondue for two, once again, it felt like forever. The strawberries we delicious, but the rest of the samplers weren't really worth it. Especially not the waffle and there was hardly enough chocolate. Definitely not worth the price.. . Overall, I would not recommend it to a friend. But I would be willing to go back and give them another chance.
I know there are some seriously mixed reviews on Max Brenner, and I might not be giving such a high rating had I eaten a different meal here, but I really feel what I had deserves 5 stars. The focus of my visit was purely on the hot chocolate. The edible ordered was originally viewed as only an incidental to me, and only being added for nourishment. Hence, why I chose to pair my salted caramel hot chocolate with the (gigantic) fruit parfait.. . I really believed the parfait would be watery Yoplait with a couple strawberries and stale granola, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The base was a very thick Greek style yogurt, the mixture of berries had a beautiful aroma of orange and honey, and the topping of dark chocolate shavings was a fun and well paired addition. It was a wonderful breakfast which didn't fill me up so much that I couldn't enjoy my hot chocolate. Possibly a smart choice for you as well if you'd like to enjoy one of Max Brenner's sweet sippables without being sickeningly full afterwards.. . My salted caramel hot chocolate was to die for. That amazing little "hug mug" of rich, creamy, and dreamy drink had me almost falling out of my chair. Perfection in a mug. The chocolate was intense, but not even slightly bitter, the caramel was not even close to cloying, rather it was buttery and nutty, and the salt was gentle and balanced out the sweetness of the proceeding. To say the least, I was very satisfied with this as my morning treat, and I was very, very happy to finally be experiencing it.. . So, the savory options at Max Brenner tend to run all over the rating scale, but I can tell you all that you're safe with the hot chocolate if nothing else. It's raved about for a reason. If you have the good graces enough to get a mug for yourself, expect to be warmed body and soul with every sip.
Items selected:. . White Corn Croquettes - Paprika dusted white corn and manchego cheese in panko. Cinnamon Apple and White Chocolate French Toast - Brown Sugar Spiced Pecans, Warm Toffee Sauce. Crispy Bacon. Salted Caramel Milkshake - Vanilla Ice Cream, Chocolate Ganache, Caramel, Sea Salt, Milk, Whipped Cream. "OMG" Chocolate Chunk Cookie - Chocolate Chip Cookie with Walnuts served with whipped cream, fresh berries, pure melted chocolate. . Having experienced "The Bald Man's" chocolates in New York many years back and quite familiar with The Forum Shops at Caesars I really cannot explain why my substantial sweet tooth had never indulged at Max Brenner's eponymous Las Vegas restaurant, but a chance mention by a friend of the space's pending closure or relocation quickly set me to mend the oversight.  Two stories in size and featuring many things chocolate plus a collection of overpriced comfort foods it was just after 10:00am when we sat down at a cozy two top near the base of the stairs and treated to pleasant "everything is good" service typical to such places a five part order was hatched as the restaurant bustled, leaving one to ponder the reasons for any pending change.  With service swift it was only a matter of minutes before selections began to arrive, the first a superlative $8 milkshake thick with caramel and rife with vanilla but topped with copious whipped cream to mask what I'd guess to be an 8oz serving, a trend carried over to each plate that followed as large prices met small portions thankfully bolstered by bold flavors.  Starting sweet and following with savory due to a kitchen miscalculation it should be noted that each of Brenner's pure chocolates are well sourced, smooth, and complex by the bar and as such both white and milk versions only served to improve the Custard French toast and Soft Cookie, the later on par with that of New York's fabled Levain Bakery in terms of taste and texture (though at 2.5x the price) and while I think everyone would have been happier to see the Croquettes first I'd be lying if I didn't say they were my favorite bite of the meal - the paprika and manchego working smoky, savory magic on the lightly fried kernels.
This has a unique factor that but Ihave to dock it one star. Very sad to see this place go, but I'm glad I made it this month before it shuts down. The entrees could be a bit improved, but I can overlook that with it being a chocolate themed restaurant. I would always start my visit with an italian thick hot cocoa (milk chocolate), and then enjoy an entree followed by one of their amazing desserts. One thing that would have helped this place along is a third party taste tester to tell them the honest truth about their dishes (for example, the recent menu item braised pork burrito with mole sauce is just not good).
You must eat here for dessert! This place is a wonderland for those with a sweet tooth! Their dessert menu probably contains anything you can think of - milkshakes, waffles, crepes, fondue, ice cream, chocolate, etc. . . I came here for my sister's birthday dinner. I decided to eat light so that I had plenty of room for dessert. I ordered the chicken and goat cheese waffle salad. The salad was light and full of cheese, bacon, tomatoes, and corn and it was all sitting atop a savory corn waffle. I also tried my cousin's mac and cheese and it was sooo good! It came with a side of marinara sauce, which was kind of odd. I didn't like it as much with the sauce.. . Now, on to dessert! I shared the Sharing Fondue for Two. It came with a small personal burner, chocolate sauce, and a large assortment of dip-ables and roast-ables. I ate it all up! The only thing I didn't really eat on the plate was the milk and white chocolate bark. .  . I need to go back and just eat dessert, no dinner!
If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would.  I have eaten at the Max Brenner in Tel Aviv many times. It's always been delicious and a great fun place to eat.  I am a local Las Vegas person and I will never come back here.  We were led to our table.  The chair I almost sat on was FILTHY!  Ok, switch chairs.   It took 15 minutes for us just to place a drink order. And when the order was taken,  the server, Danielle, was rushed and indifferent. She also kept calling us "guys" and that was annoying.   I ordered the salmon. It was as dry and as stiff as my Nike sneaker.  When the table was cleared, she noticed that I only ate one or two bites of my salmon.  She asked how it was. Seriously?  She needs to learn plate cues.  See my reviews of Hank's Steakhouse.  Anywho, I told her it was terrible. She told me she would take it off the bill.  Really? She took an order, which I didn't eat, off the bill?  How generous!!!!  She gave us the bill and didn't even offer to give us a dessert...nothing just okay and goodbye.  So, my three kids and I went over to the Cheesecake Factory and had a fantastic dessert with great service.  . . So if you want a sneaker for dinner with lousy service go to Max Brenner.  Although, I understand this restaurant is closing in April.  I can see why.....
Maybe due to the closure next Sunday, our server, Melissa first forgot our order and messed up our check in the end. I will miss the S'more crepe in the future, but the service today had me no regret to lose this place.
Last year I heard about this place and took my son here for Easter brunch. So thisyear I asked where he wanted to go get an afternoon snack. He said he wanted to go here because they had a great milkshake. We got here around 3:00. There was just a few people dining. It looked like they were getting ready for the dinner crowd. I ordered the popsicle that I had heard so much about. They said they were out of them but would give me a vanilla cone and I could put the toppings on it. I was served  two scoops of ice cream in a waffle cone. There were three small bowls with it. In them was chocolate pearls, chocolate sauce and something I couldn't identify. I think it was browned coconut. I wasn't impressed at all. The chocolate was to fancy for me I guess. If I'm going to pay $8.00 for an Ice Cream cone I would like it to be more spectacular. My son said his shake wasn't as good as the first one. Two people came in and asked for something and they said they were out. I gave this two tries and I won't be back.
I ordered the salted caramel hot chocolate-- absolutely amazing! And I also ordered the marshmallow pizza.. But the thing is, it never got to my table! So I asked my server when it was going to come because I was getting impatient and she claimed I never ordered it. . . The salted caramel hot chocolate was good, but it was all I got from them because of my cruddy server.
I've heard good things about this place, but the service is TERRIBLE. My boyfriend & I made reservations beforehand, stating that we were celebrating our anniversary. When we arrived, it took the host two minutes to greet us (she made eye contact and said nothing). She asked us to wait, which was fine but when another couple who made reservations as well checked in, she seated them before us! We were seated outside next to a large group. Our server was overly sarcastic and not so friendly. Onto the food... We ordered the penne pasta with chicken. It wasn't amazing. Ordered the heart truffle cake and shake and our server left before my boyfriend could finish the remainder of our dessert order! Tried to get his attention and he half-turned his head and said to us "oh I hear you what do you want?" as he turns back to multitask. Umm, kinda rude! So then a couple minutes later, the server comes to take away dirty utensils and give us new ones. He neglects to switch out my fork and I catch him before he leaves, handing him my fork and telling him it was dirty. He proceeds to give me a fork and says "umm here's this one. I think that's clean, right?" He then looks at the fork that I gave him and says "oh those are just water stains!" I tell him that I had used that one, and he blames me boyfriend saying that "he said it was clean!" WOW!!! NO WONDER THIS IS CLOSING DOWN ON SUNDAY!. . HOWEVER I must say that the hot chocolate I ordered makes up for some of the crappy experience! I was DIVINE! I love hug mugs! And I would totally come back and go thru the crappy wait and service all for that salted caramel white hot chocolate! Yum!!!
They are out of everything here. I can't believe a restaurant that is out of this many main menu items. No salmon, no fish tacos, no prosecco. Who runs out of prosecco?? I am gluten free and they only have one item on there gluten free menu that is available. 2 thumbs down. Their excuses is that they close on Sunday. Bullshit
The food and everything were wonderfully delicious, but the service bothered me a lot. The person who seated us was really nice, but our waiter seemed really rude. He would just throw everything on the table, napkins, forks, spoons, the check. It seemed like he was having a tantrum yet trying to be nice for a good tip. The food here is extremely good to eat, I had the hazelnut strawberry crepe and a Oreo milkshake. I would go back again even if the service is horrible.
Max Brenner is one of those places that I take out of town guests too.  Most people love it.  After the last few visits I think it is just ok.  Good but not amazing.  Price point is a little high for not being great.  For a restaurant that is dedicated to chocolate I expect more.  I've mostly had desserts and sweet items.  Hot chocolate is really good.  Fondue nothing special.  Ice cream sundaes average.  Chocolate pizza pretty good.  Waffles meh.  Crepes ok.  Chocolate martini best ever.  Kids menu is cute.  There are rumors that they will reopen as a store.  Until then when I'm at Caesars I'll see you at Vosges.
The food was delicious, but they were closing a few days after and had a very limited amount of items left so it was hard finding something I wanted to order and look on the list and find out they ran out of it. I ended up getting the cinnamon apple French toast and it was really good, but not worth 14.75
Omg!!! By far the best chocolate place!! Their hazelnut chocolate milk shake is to die for! A must try!!! Love the food here too!!!
