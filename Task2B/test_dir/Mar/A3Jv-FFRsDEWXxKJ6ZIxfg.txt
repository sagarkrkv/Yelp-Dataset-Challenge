We had the braised short ribs and the shepherd's pie.  Both were perfectly cooked and amazing.  The service was also friendly and location/ambiance nice.
After an amazing night at Gordon Ramsay's Steak, we had to try the Pub & Grill (sadly, Janel of Hell's Kitchen fame has already left the crew). . . The staff was friendly and attentive. The waiter we had was so polite and so nice. I adored him!!! . . For my meal, I got the fish and chips. It was alright. I'm also not a huge fan of the fries (they were soaked in the oil from the fried fish). The fish kept coming out of the fried bater. . . My parents each had a beef burger and lamb burger. They were really good. . . My date had the vegetable salad, which was refreshing, amazing, and light. I would so go back just for that! The vinaigrette on it was so delectable. . . He had the scallops for his entree, which was covered in the best white sauce. It was so good that I kept dipping my fish in it or my fries. Definitely the best out of the ones we ordered. . . As a side, we all had the lobster mac and cheese to share for the table. Um ... yes. This was actually better than the mac & cheese at GR's Steak. There were HUGE chunks of lobster in it. . . By the end, I was licking the bowl - we sadly have photographic proof of this that I must now go destroy. . . Also, GR's Pub & Grill have two of the dishes that are exclusives to his Hell's Kitchen menu at Steak: Scottish Egg and the toffee dessert!!!!. . Check it out if you're a fan!
The skins on the Bangers in the Bangers and Mash were very tough. The mash was very sloppy. The gravy not too bad. I had apple and rhubarb crumble for desert  which was dry and needed custard. All in all, expensive mediocre simple food. I'm disappointed Gordon.
It was my birthday and I wanted to go someplace special. I've heard amazing things about the Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill. I made sure I called and made a reservation a couple weeks in advanced for lunch. . . When we got there everything was set! We were seated quickly at a large table in the back. It was cool because I could lean back in the seat I was in and see right into the kitchen, which was awesome!! Our waiter took our drink orders while my party arrived and looked over the menu. Pricey yes! But I totally knew this going in and was not shocked. My fellow Yelper and good friend Dyanna L. asked the waiter what his suggestions were. First thing out of his mouth was the Seared Scallops. This totally helped me in my picking process! . . Ok, so for the food, it was ALL excellent! Let me start out with the appetizers. We ordered the Mini Pub Burgers which were three perfect little sliders with bacon, lettuce, onion, and a little side of mayo. The Calamari was fried perfectly and they even used the leg parts (my fav) it came with a side of tartar sauce and a side of cocktail sauce. The Deviled Eggs I did not try, but the presentation was awesome. Instead of the eggs being filled you get to fill the eggs yourself! We also ordered the warm pretzels that came with a delicious cheese spread and a tangy mustard. . . For our entrees I finally decided on the Seared Scallops. Yummy!!! They were perfectly cooked and came in a cream broth with small clams, leeks, and potatoes! I wanted to tip the bowl up and drink the rest of the broth, but I remembered my manners. lol My husbandchose the Shepards Pie. It was tender and filled to the brim with meat and veggies! Dyanna L. chose the Lobster Mac and Cheese. Omg was it filled with lobster!!! I was in heaven when she offered me a bite! She also had a Caesar Salad that looked very tasty! Her boyfriend got the Fish and Chips. It looked so crispy. I'm totally getting that next time! My other friend Rachael ordered the Mini Pie Tasting. It came with three little pies one was a Shepards Pie. The other was a Steak and Ale Pie. That was her favorite one. The last of the three was a Chicken Pot Pie. My other friends Becki and Eric got Lamb Burgers that where huge and came with crispy fries! . . Other than the service being a little slow, it was a great experience overall, but I think it was because our original waiter was sent home in the middle of our visit. I loved all the food. This is a great place for a special occasion! Just be prepared to drop some cash, but it's completely worth it! Yummy!
I wanted to give these guys a higher rating and if it was based on the server, they'd get 5 stars. The food was nothing better than basic bar food. The fries were cold (fish and chips) and chewy. The salmon was good but lacked the 'umph' to make it great. . The desert ( toffee bread pudding) was the highlight of the meal. For the price I felt I could have done MUCH better.
Food was very good - scotch eggs, pretzels, tomato soup, sliders...we loved it all.  Took a while to get, but it was worth the wait.. We had an awesome server, Jamie - she was super attentive and made it a fun experience for us... make sureyou ask for her!
TL;DR: it was good but not $30 for a burger, fries and caesar salad good.. . i ordered medium-rare and bf ordered medium, they switched our orders and i ended up with the medium burger wondering why such an expensive burger couldn't be cooked the way i wanted it. upon inspection we realized that our burgers had been switched (which is strange because the waiter made a big deal of putting a flag on one of the burgers to remember which is which, lol) and so we traded burgers. the medium-rare was downright cold, which isn't how a proper burger patty should be.. . the salad was really much too mild in flavor because the dressing didn't have enough kick. there were anchovies in the salad but they weren't salty, just oily and bland. overall the salad lacked salt and since there was no salt or pepper on the table i couldn't adjust the taste for myself.. . the fries were really good though. crispy and garlicky, my favorite kind of fries :)
Eating here was a bit of a let-down for me, as I am used to the most delicious food and superb service in Vegas. I've been to my share of the "pubs" in town, most notably the pubs by Todd English and Michael Mina, and was expecting a similar experience. . . The drinks were delicious, most notably the Pub's version of a Moscow Mule, but my food was mediocre at best. Perhaps I ordered something really random in the Pub's version of Butter Chicken with basmati rice, but the sauce was bland and way too peppery at the same time. The rice was tender and well-cooked, but so drenched in butter that it appeared yellow. Other friends ordered fish and chips, the pea soup, the sliders, and fries. The fries were soggy and limp, which was a huge letdown. Everything was else was fine, just nothing to write home about.. . The atmosphere is fun, but that was probably the best part.
Beware:  Not as seen on TV.  No exacting standards for perfectly cooked food here.. . Appetizers:  Calamari, Toad in a Hole, and Scotch Eggs.  They were all overcooked.. . Entree:  Fish & Chips and Shepherd's Pie.  Fish was okay, but the chips were a soggy, greasy mess.  The flavor of the Pie was okay, but the mash potatoes were gummy.  And they had no HP sauce for the pie.  I thought this was supposed to be a British Pub.. . Desserts:  Sticky Toffee Pudding and Spotted Dick.  First was not very moist and the latter too rummy.. . Definitely not a do-over.  Not a good value and left disappointed.
My boyfriend and I visited on a Saturday night. Even though the place looked packed, we were seated within 5 minutes of walking in without a reservation. We didn't want to spend too much money since we had mistakenly come to Caesar's looking for Ramsey's BURGR and decided to eat here since we were starving.. . We were seated behind the wall of beer kegs which was awkward since the table was raised and we were technically sharing the table with another group on the other side. The table was also weirdly wide and the place was noisy so we couldn't have much conversation. My boyfriend had the fish and chips and I had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is a side dish. The fish and chips was surprisingly big. The fish was well seasoned and still moist. With the tartar sauce they tasted really good. The fries were also nice and crisp and well seasoned. The house made ketchup was really good. The lobster Mac n' cheese was a bit underwhelming. The noodles were a nice al dente and the bechamel sauce was rich and creamy but I was expecting more lobster for the price (ridiculously $21). And it was still side dish size. I had maybe 1 small piece of  lobster for every 7 bites which is too small a ratio to call it lobster Mac n' cheese if you ask me! Also could have used more cheese, but I guess that's personal preference. . . For the pub atmosphere and the pub quality grub, Ramsey should definitely consider lowering the prices.
This place brought back memories of my very first Elite event. It also brought back a bar set very high when it comes to food, service, atmosphere and everything that you should expect when dining in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. . We had a 2pm reservation for fellow Elite Allison's birthday. She went with lunch for the group because it could be quite spendy depending on what you get. Well worth it for a celebration in my opinion. . Between our group we had fish and chips, lobster mac and cheese, scallops, the pot pie trio, and a couple burgers. Also, deviled eggs, pretzel bread, and Caesar salad for starters. I was lucky enough to try the majority of this stuff, and what stood out the most was: 1. The scallops. Not even a scallop fan but these melted like butter in your mouth. I would think Chef Ramsay was standing over the cook calling him a bloody donkey to make sure they were correct. 2. The lobster mac. HUGE chunks of lobster and a cheese that didn't overtake the flavor, but wasn't too bland either. 3. The deviled eggs. You stuff them yourself, and they have bacon. Need I say more? . Everything was delicious and I would order everything again. That says a lot. . The negatives, not much but they should have complimentary bread. When a burger cost $20-25, you could start with a little something. 2. The service was EH. Our first initial guy Chris, was great. But he left mid lunch and our next guy wasn't nearly as attentive or funny. He did not seem to enjoy his job as much. I wish we had have given the tip to Chris before he bounced, he earned it. The hostess were also a little snooty. Like hello, you are pretty, you're working for a famous chef, and you get to wear a cute dress to work- SMILE it won't hurt. . . The positives outweigh the negatives by far which is why this is still a 4 star review. Until next time.
We had dinner here.  While we mostly liked the food my salad was not great.  The dressing had so much lemon it over powered everything and literally made me pucker.  Also, it said shaved vegetables which really was just a few slices of carrots/radishes.  Not what I was expecting.. . The tomato soup and the pork chop was delicious.  . . Service/experience was okay.  I don't think it was worth the price.
Still one of our favorite places to eat while in Vegas. The staff actually remembered us...we bought 8 wooden placemats on the first weekend it was open.. Shrimp cocktail was the best we have ever had. . Take the time to make reservation for lunch, afternoon chill or dinner. You will not have to wait.
Just a quick bite to eat early in the evening but enjoyed the bar and appetizers we had.  Drinks were good and the atmosphere was perfect for pre-gaming.  Hard to give more than four stars simply because we weren't there long enough but there's no reason I wouldn't go back.
Mr Ramsay got greedy here... this is supposed to be an in-between for his 3 restaurants in Vegas but it's overpriced and unimpressive. I love BurGR and GR Steak but this place missed the mark for me and I can't say I was surprised based on the reviews. We had a friend that wanted to go though so we gave it a try. . . Roast beef sandwich - "would you like a sandwich with those fries?" This is what they should ask when you order. The fries were impressive in both portion and taste and totally overshadowed the much less impressive roast beef sandwich. The caramelized onion au jus was awesome but they barely gave me enough for half of my already small sandwich. I ordered mine without the horseradish aioli as I'm not a fan of horseradish and honestly a good roast beef sandwich shouldn't need much else other than the au jus. The meat was good, not great and it was pretty much just lacking all around. At $18 I was quite disappointed. But again... fries... awesome. Had to ask for additional ketchup though as they brought out the smallest little half shot glass of ketchup lol. . Warm salty pretzels - 3 pretzel bread sticks for $8... umm... how about some free bread on the table? Isn't this pretty standard when you are paying for a nice meal?. . PEI Mussels & Clams - not my choice to order but I'm a fan of clams so I picked at it... and when I say picked at it.. I mean i had to literally pick at the plate to find the tiny bits of clam that had fallen out ofall the shells. The chorizo was the best part of this dish and there was about 4 little slices of it.. . Chicken Pot Pie - KC ordered this and enjoyed it but it was awfully small for $23. I took a bite and it had good flavor but the one she makes is better.. . Our friends ordered steak and caesar salad and seemed to enjoy it but felt like it was overpriced for the place.. . Service was so-so... waitress was very friendly but made a few mistakes and forgot some things. She made up for it by comping the pretzels and I don't get too upset with mistakes as long as you are friendly and make an attempt to make up for it. . . No ciroc at the bar?! Seriously... I just don't understand that. The place was packed though on a Friday night and I'm sure it will keep doing well with a great location inside Caesars Palace. Crazy tourists....
So firstly we were excited to go here, but from start to finish this place has problems. We were seated and our first server came, took our drink orders and left. My wife opened her menu to find it torn and dirty. Our second server came and so did our drinks, my Guinness had the biggest head ever, I asked it to be topped off server 2 rolled his eyes but did it. My friend had ordered a glass of sparkling wine, but the one on the menu wasn't right, I mean come on update your menu. As to the menu it's not detailed enough 3 of us ordered "toad in the hole" but although the server questioned the order he didn't explain how much food it was, plus they were supposed to come with HP Sauce but didn't, when we asked for some they said they didn't have any (order hadn't come in). The food is ok, but the service is just so, so. One staff member was standing near us drinking Starbucks (bet Mr Ramsey would have something say about that on his TV Show if it was somebody else's restaurant). In the ladies toilets one was damaged and not in use, in both mens and ladies toilets they had huge wicker baskets to put your paper towels in, they looked stupid and tacky. All in all a bad experience.
3 stars. I think my expectations were too high, sadly I was let down. The service was great. Our server even came to our rescue when he noticed our table was a bit wobbly (not a big deal but with the stemware they give you, it's easy to see why this could potentially be a disaster). . Okay the table is fixed and our orders are in. It didn't take long at all for our meals to arrive. I got the pub burger, my friend ordered the pork belly. They were just okay. Nothing to write home about. Forgettable. I think I'll try Gordon Ramsay BurGR next time instead.
WEIRD menu, and I love food!! Everything that sounded good at first glance has horseradish, onions, or bacon (all of which I do not eat) in or on it.  I had the tomato soup, which was so salty I couldn't eat half of it, but the 3 guys said their burgers were good once they scraped off the gross sauce.  We were consistently ignored my the server, after he said he would get drinks, a dessert menu, and a couple other things.  There are many more fabulous places to go in Vegas- skip this one!
Great food and great staff! We sat at the bar and the bartenders were awesome. My boyfriend ordered his usual beer and the bartender gave him a sample of the house recommendation beer: Innus and Gunn. He loved it and switched beers. We live in NYC and we are now on a search for that beer. I got one of speciality cocktails; I forgot the name of it. It had pureed blueberries in it. It was so light and refreshing!  For food, we had the prime rib and the pie sampler. They were delicious!  Definitely coming back here next time in Vegas!
First off, not cheap. Ramsay places will set you back, and that should be a given. But if you have Total Rewards, you get a discount and you can pay with points. . . Next, go on open table and make a reservation. It just makes things easier. . . We started off with the sea salt malt vinegar crisps. It's just potato chips with aioli and vinegar to dip, but a tasty simple starter.. . The fish and chips were $26, even with the Total Rewards discount. It's 2 hunks of fish in a light batter, over skinny fries. No peas anymore. My soda was $4, which my server didn't refill until prompted. . . Stephen had the pie sampler which he liked. It didn't look that filling for $18, but he seemed to find it adequate. . . Our lunch would've set us back $57 but since I gamble a lot, I used my points and got it complimentary. Score!
OK.  Entree came out before the appetizer.  Not sure if I misread the menu but...but I was very disappointed with the BLT.  The pork belly was good but no bacon?  Really want a BLT that has crispy bacon.  Wouldn't eat here again.  Service...so so compared to what you see on TV.  Disappointing.  Not at all what I expected from Gordon Ramsey.  Live and learn.
Pretty pricey for pub food (we spent over $200 for 3 people) but everything was seasoned superbly!!! Had the calamari and salmon with crispy skin. Great with the exception of being a little oily. The sticky toffee pudding is to die! Get that dessert if anything! The cocktails are also very good! I would definitely go back!
Fish & chips was so delicious!!! It was my birthday, and the waiter brought me a complimentary dessert. It was the toffee & date cake, & it was the most delicious dessert I have ever had. Service was exceptional & I will definitely be back!!'
Amazing experience. Had the lamb and it was so tender and juicey. I could have it for every meal.
Dining here felt like we were on an episode of Hell's Kitchen! Both blue and red teams have failed miserably! I was waiting to hear yelling and screaming from Chef Ramsay from the kitchen.. . My cousin wanted to dine here before we proceeded with his bachelor party evening. We didn't make reservations here, so we ended up with a wait of forty five minute to an hour. When the estimated seating time came, we were seated promptly. While browsing our menus, our drink orders were taken and water glasses filled. I was very anxious and excited to try Chef Ramsay's favorite dish, beef wellington. Apparently, it wasn't on the menu. So, I ended up getting the roast prime rib entree, medium rare.. . After twenty minutes had passed, we were told our entrees would be out in five minutes. Then ten, fifteen, and thirty came and went. Still, no signs of our entrees. Yet, other customers who were seated after us had their entrees served. We were all ready to get up and leave and dine else where. But, we all just decided to stick it through. Once our entrees were being served, they were served in waves. I was the last one in our party of seven to receive my entree.. . For a $40 entree, I'll admit the entree looked hearty. The prime rib was cooked to a medium rare and accompanied with some glazed baby carrots, brussel sprouts, and mashed potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. I had a side of creamy horseradish sauce, but no au jus for dipping. I would say that the prime rib was comparable to other dining establishments in Vegas. I would've been better off with the $10 prime rib dinners and paid way less than $40. But, I guess it was for the name and experience, right?. . At the conclusion of our meal, my cousin went to place a complaint regarding our dinner service. The server and hostess were great, but not sure what was going on in the kitchen. I really wanted to like this place, but I wasn't impressed at all.
Items Selected:. . Warm Salty Pretzels with Cheese Sauce - Bacon and Parmesan, Green Garlic, and Plain. Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips - Cod with Tartar and Lemon. Red Wine Braised Short Rib - Horseradish Mashed Potatoes with Onions, Carrots, Parsnips, Red Wine Jus. Trio of Pies - Chicken Pot Pie with Bechamel, Vegetables, Bacon/ Steak & Ale Pie with Root Vegetables and Mushrooms / Shepherd's Pie with Root Vegetables and Cheddar Mash Potatoes. Sauteed Forest Mushrooms - Poached Farm Egg. Spotted DIC - Steamed Bread Pudding with Raisins and Cream Sauce. Sticky Toffee Pudding - Sweet Cream Ice Cream. . Having come away from a late-2013 visit to Chef Gordon Ramsay's Steakhouse at The Paris quite impressed by both the quality and the brand I knew a visit to casual sibling "Pub & Grill" was only a matter of time - friends and fans of chef's shows and celebrity frequent to visit Sin City.  Housed in Caesars in a sizable space renovated from Bradley Ogden featuring plenty of wood, kegs, television, and Brit-kitsch it was just after noon when I sat down with two old friends and greeted by friendly, though pushy, service orders were expedited to the tune of an appetizer, a side, three mains, and two desserts - high prices and small portions tempered by a Total Rewards card...at least slightly.  Focusing mostly on signatures and favorites present since the menu's inception dining began with three small but lovely seasoned pretzels paired with cheese and mustard for $8 and progressing to plates proper another trio arrived in the $21 trio of small ramekin-pies, all well prepared but only the lamb loaded Shepherd living up to the high standards set by the exemplary golden cod selected by my friend, soggy 'chips' notwithstanding.  Ignoring the shortrib and what I'm told were vastly overseasoned potatoes while wishing some form of seasoning had graced the flavorless mushrooms it was with sweet redemption that desserts both shined, the rustic Sticky Toffee Pudding every bit as good as the fancy version at Steak and the "DIC" a bowl of buttery custard hefty with raisins and aromatics that I'd gladly return for along with a cup of coffee - breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
It's a-ok. We made a reservation and were seated promptly. Our server was friendly. The food was tasty enough, but not crave-worthy or exceptional.. . The ambiance is upscale pub. Overall, it's got a nice vibe.. . The beer list didn't do much for me as there wasn't anything particularly notable. But all the standard ones you'd expect at a pub are there.. . We ordered the calamari, fish and chips, English ale onion soup, and lobster mac 'n' cheese. Our server somehow forgot the lobster mac 'n' cheese and brought us fries instead. She promptly fixed the error, leaving the fries and putting in an order for the lobster mac 'n' cheese. But then she added the fries to our bill! Seriously. . . The calamari was alright. Good enough to eat when you're hungry. Not good enough to ever order again. The fish and chips were good. They're fish and chips - nothing particularly notable, but the fish was battered and fried well. The English ale soup was quite tasty and the best thing of the night. The fries were alright. Would never actually order them. The lobster mac 'n' cheese was tasty. But I've had far better elsewhere and probably wouldn't order it again here given the price for the small portion.. . Aside from the order mix-up, we had a pleasant evening here. It's a perfectly fine place. Good enough food, but not the wow food that one often comes to expect of Vegas dining.
I didn't know what to expect from the Pub & Grille. I knew Ramsey's name was attached and that might mean really awesome food or just a cash grab trying to lure dumb tourists into paying twice as much for their food.... . The restaurant is really well designed and looks cool especially the wall of kegs. The waiters wear vests and have these little satchels. Pretty well themed.. . As far as service, your water never drops below half way. The lady was on top of it!. . Our waiter though was lazy, lingered, and only checked on us after we finished the vast majority of the meal. What if I wanted more than a thimble of ketchup? He seemed bored and pretentious. Plus he messed up our order. No bacon on one and the other was undercooked.. . As far as food goes, what a straight rip off. 21$ for a burger with bacon and fries. I'm not sure if they ran out to Carl's Jr and grabbed up a bunch of 6$ burgers because that's all I tasted. Bland, small, and overpriced. The fries were tasty but really greasy and like I complained before all you get is a simple thimble of ketchup.. . Our host had Prime Rib. His plate looked like he went to a Claim Jumper but was priced like a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.. . In the end I just I picture Mr. Ramsey rolling over in his... giant pile of money.
We had to visit at least one of GR's restaurants in Vegas so we chose this one.. . 5 of the 6 of us had the prime rib, the 6th (damn combo-breaker), had something else which I don't remember.. . In any case, the meal was excellent. The prime rib was perfectly marbled, had the right amount of seasoning and tasted exactly how it should. I will say, generally speaking, either restaurants don't know what the hell "medium rare" means or they're afraid of getting sued if someone eats meat too underdone and gets sick. Medium-rare seems to be always served as Medium.. . The Yorkshire pudding that came with it was also excellent. Fluffy and flavourful. I don't see this served with prime rib in other restaurants as much as I'd like to.. . The service was adequate but not spectacular by any stretch. Drinks came in a reasonable amount of time, as with the food. Refills were a touch slow.. . The price was a little bit steepbut not in outer space by any means. Enjoying the food makes it easy to forget how much it cost.. . I'd say that you should check this place out on the strength of their prime rib alone.
As a foodie I was super excited to go eat at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. We were in Las Vegas for the weekend and decided to spoil ourselves. . . I ordered the Lamb it was just AMAZING, every bit of it melted in my mouth. I also ordered a side of the mash potatoes which were also amazing. . . My husband and a friend we were with did not enjoy themselves like I did though. My husband ordered the shepherds pie, it was his dream to taste Ramsey's twist on it.  Unfortunately he was extremely disappointed, his meal came out (we ordered two at our table) more like a soup. It was extremely watery at the bottom, embarrassed to complain at Gordon Ramsays restaurant my husband just stared at his food. I finically built up the courage to tell the waiter we were unhappy with his meal... It was returned and made again (which was better then the first). We also received a dessert on the house which was nice. . . Wish I could afford to go to his restaurants all the time! =)
Had their slider burgers with truffle fries.  Very good.  Would have rated 5 star but was seated at the bar and due to some poorly placed beer taps couldn't see past them to watch the NCAA tourney games on TVs behind  the bar.
This is REALLY sad, because I actually came here a few months ago (back in January) and really enjoyed it then (I would've given it a 4/5 then), but after the experience tonight, I had to lower it :( I'm a HUGE fan of Mr. Ramsay, and when I had first eaten here, I was in love with all the dishes! I had never had fish and chips that good before!. . After today, though, I don't know where I'd get those fish and chips again :( I went in today not knowing that just about 4 weeks ago, they changed the menu around and some of the recipes (I asked the waiters/waitresses about it). The fish, which before were perfectly sized, flaky, melt-in-your-mouth goodness, was now giant, thick slabs that were dry and overcooked. The batter, which used to be crispy but flaky to the touch, were now thick and hard. The fries, which used to be thick but crunchy, were now dry and burnt-tasting.. . I did have other dishes, but nothing that was better than average. The majority of the dishes I ordered last time were no longer on the menu after the menu change, so nothing to compare (those other dishes were GREAT the first time I visited, though!).. . The waiters/waitresses were quite nice though. To be fair, the place probably deserves a 2/5 stars now, but after that overwhelmingly disappointing decision to change the recipes and menu so drastically, I had to give this 1/5...I'm so sad.
WOW What a big mistake... Had the fried Cali almost ok and Pig rapped devil eggs nasty. Bacon was cold and under cooked. Yoke tasted like vinegar.  The drinks are fine. Service was strange.. The bartender took my place setting and beer before I was finished... Must be a Ray Ray thing I guess that's his nickname... Strange uniforms.... We will not be back. To many super KOOL place other than GR Pub & Grill...
DON'T waste your money and time. After having a great experience at Gordon Ramsey's BurGR, we had hoped an English pub by an EmUK chef would be amazing. Sorely disappointed. Hubby had fish and chips. The fish was not seasoned at all. The batter was crunchy but amateur chefs can get crunchy. Here is a tip: try salt.. I had the lobster macn cheese. Solely based on this I'd have given it 3 stars. Better than fish n chips. Lots of lobster but mac n cheese was blander than it could have been. I had much better lobster mac at House of Blues. The staff seemed to be working hard but we had to wait forever for drinks and for the server in general. The bus boy was awesome though. Kept our waters filled and table taken care of.. Fish n chips: 2. Mac n cheese: 3. Service: 2.5. . Hugely disappointed that a restaurant with GR's name would be so lacking!
I sat at the bar, and enjoyed the food. I ordered the seasonal item which was a salmon with green lentils and chanterelle mushrooms. The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was not dry at all. I thought the price was a little high since the dish was $30, but the pricing tends to be the trend along the Strip. The servers at the bar were attentive and made sure that I had everything that I needed.
Great food, but it was a little pricey. The goat cheese burger I had was phenomenal and the only reason I wasn't upset with the price was because I was up at the tables. Their fries are also great, I love shoe string style. Another part of their menu that was unique was their cocktails. I had a cucumber gin drink that was tasty, yet strong. Granted, it was about 8$, but for Vegas prices that's about as good as it gets. . . Note: I was staying at Caesar's so this place was also uber convenient for me.
'If you don't spot by this place the next time you're in Vegas... consider yourself a f*ckin donkey'. Service was okay but the food was great (a little bit on the heavy side). This place is better then Ramsey's spot in The London Hotel in LA
Wow I had one terrible dining experience a year ago on a visit, but returned last month for a conference and wow what a great change. New managers, new menu, customer interaction was great with the servers. Totally impressed wit hth food quality and service. This place really made a great positive change and I will return, nice improvment....tenderloin and salmon are excellent BTW... nice place to dine for lite fare, pub food or a good well prepared meal. Servers, we found were great, ours was Daisy and she was terrific. Enjoy :-)
This restaurant was my third stop on my Gordon Ramsay tour (Steak, Burgr, Pub).. . Kind of a disappointment. The beer, wine, and overall drink selection was nothing special. Average, at best. The food was just OK and definitely not worth the price.. . Service was just okay. The staff was friendly, but slow and hard to flag down. We constantly felt like we were waiting. Waiting for drink orders, waiting for drinks, waiting for food orders, waiting for other drink orders, waiting for drinks we ordered that never showed up, and waiting for dessert. It was ridiculous.. . I had a shot at a few beers, scallops, short rib, scotch egg, steak, and of course the sticky toffee.. . The scallops were abysmal. I've paid half the cost and received twice as many, better prepared. Two people ordered scallops at our table and both orders were bad. They were so sandy that it felt like I threw a handful of sand in my mouth and started chewing. One order seemed overcooked. Would not have this again at this restaurant.. . The short rib, while tender, seemed lackluster in flavor. As with the scallops, I have had much more flavorful short rib for a fraction of the price elsewhere. I would not order this again at this restaurant.. . The steak was nothing special, honestly, and I felt was about twice as costly as necessary for what it was.. . The scotch egg was actually very good. Probably one of the better/best scotch eggs I've had. I would order this again.. . The sticky toffee was great, and I would order it again. One of the best desserts I have ever had.. . All in all, I would not recommend this place. You can get similar or better food at a plethora of other restaurants, for a fraction of the price. If I were Gordon Ramsay I would be appalled at how this restaurant is executing.
I had an excellent experience at this pub. The decor, service and food were all great. I particularly enjoyed the fish & chips!
This place is disappointing. They needed up our order three times and was not willing to substitute items in our entree when they clearly told is they ran out of. For example we had a burger and it was supposed to come with a dill pickle and pepperchini garnish. All they said was they ran out and that's it. I thought most restaurants would substitute something for that. It's a $20 burger that's worth $9 after this experience. Also the wait took an hour wait. Will not come back. Gordon better come back and fix this.
I'm going to take a shot at gordon. You always yell at your chefs for seasoning, but your pea soup had zero salt in it! Your bangers and mash, amazing, best dish I had there. Loved loved the onion gravy. Great beer selection too! Just add salt gordon, please! (Imagine me yelling this like he does)
Made reservations in advance to try and get good seating and they threw us in the aisle! The waitress had to check to see if the chips portion of fish and chips was made from "real potatoes"! They weren't even chips they were cheap frozen fries! Not British at all! My wife was sorely disappointed as for me I was talked into a $35 ny strip steak, very very small and very very dry I would have sent it back but that would have meant we had seen our waitress again! The table next to us was having similar problems! Oh yeah and they were out of scotch eggs! Not what you would expect from chef Gordon Ramsay. The service was equally as bad as the food by far the worst $100 I ever spent! And I left hungry! Thanks for ruining me and my wife's ten year anniversary Gordon!
