I try to eat mostly raw vegan food but when i cheat once in a while I come here and have veggie ramen with okra nato :). The servers here are super friendly and love the vibe in here all together
-Sunday Girls' Night Out with besties Chinita Bonita and the Nigerian Nightmare (bonafide Yelp nicknames.). -Three days before Lent and giving up sugar, I wanted to come here specifically for the honey toast, but also have dinner, so it was pre-Mardi Gras, Asian style.. -There is a menu here, as well as daily specials on a separate piece of paper, PLUS multiple items that are not on the menu, but posted onthe walls all over the restaurant on signs.  This means that you must get up from your seat and walk around reading the signs and try to remember which ones you want to order by the time you get back to your seat and the waitress returns to your table.  Then you order one of the items and hope your waitress knows which sign you're talking about because if not, you might have to get back up and walk her to the sign across the room.  . -The plates are good for sharing, so we each ordered a few items and tasted everything.  I did not have the sea urchin mochi dish; Bonita and Nightmare had that.. . FOOD:  miso ramen (half order); sea urchin mochi; yam potato and sesame salad; mapo tofu; pork dumplings;  mini pork okonomiyaki; honey toast.. . The honey toast takes about 15-20 minutes to prepare, so our waitress kindly gave us a heads-up when she saw that we were slowing down.  This is only the second time I've had this dessert and I definitely liked this version better than the first one I tried elsewhere.  Served with two scoops of ice cream and large pieces of toast with honey drizzled on it, this is the perfect thing to share with your favorite people, and that's what I recommend because it's big.  CB and I did most of the devouring while NN watched.  More for us.. Our bill was less than $43 and although service was a little hit and miss, I would definitely come back with the girls.  After Easter.
Ichiza is always a great late-night spot to fill your cravings or to just hang out after work with a beer and some skewers. Apparently, I'm not the only one who thinks that. As a result, Ichiza is always packed, especially in the later hours. Sometimes you won't have to wait or may have a short 5-10 minute wait if you're eating alone or in a party of two (that way you can sit at the bar) but if you require a table, the wait is usually at least 30 minutes or even more. Of course, their earlier hours are less crowded, but many of the menu items (such as skewers) are not available.. . Ichiza has been around for years and they remain pretty consistent in terms of food and service. A few times, however, my orders were forgotten or took a ridiculously long time to arrive. It can get very busy with only a few waitresses so I can see why mistakes happen.. . The vibe is very authentic and is a local hotspot. There are item names posted all over the walls in both Japanese and English and sometimes you just have to wing it and see what arrives at your table. My favorites are the beef tataki, skewers (chicken gizzard and liver), grilled squid, and the tuna and tofu salad. The beef bowl is also a nice and filling item if you're hungrier. There is always hot green tea, which I love, and sometimes a little mini appetizer depending on the day and what they have.. . There are so many menu items to be had so you really just have to try it yourself. It's a fun and casual dining experience with guaranteed good food that has created so many regulars over the years, myself included.
The clubs weren't that hot that night, and my friends and I were hungry for some grub.  "ICHIZA!" we proclaimed.  Of course, there could be no other choice.. . This place always ends up being one of our go-to spots in Vegas after the clubs.  They're not open 24 hours, but they're still open pretty late.  If we know we can make it in time, this is what we crave.. . There's really only one thing we want.  The hamburger steak.  It's not even on the menu, but it's so delicious.  The patty is moist and seasoned very well.  Then just a little bit of gravy to top it.  We can't resist.. . Add some fried rice to order to complete this meal, and at 2am in the morning, we are happy campers.. . ICHIZA!  My happy after clubbing place in Vegas.
Food is great. It usually super busy in here so be prepared to wait. When you are seated the menu is all over the walls so I'm usually just pointing at items. They just bring out whatever is ready and sometimes there's one person at the table not eating. I've actually had a meal finished before the other persons food came. I've also experienced them forgetting my order from my while parties. Service is like any other typical Asian restaurant, there's none. I'm giving them 4 because the I do love the food and ambiance.
I don't understand why this place has so many good reviews and a 4-star rating. We were disappointed with the quality of pretty much everything we ordered. . . The ramen was super bland, with the soup base being super watery. Same thing with the udon noodles, though it was slightly better than the ramen.. . All their skewers were hard to eat as well. We ordered different types (liver, gizzards, tongue, etc.) and every single one was so overcooked that it was rather difficult to pull the pieces off the stick (practically stuck and hard as rock). . . The "uni over baked mochi" seemed a bit interesting when we saw their special dishes posted along the wall. But when it came, it looked quite awful. The mochi tasted like stale gelatin that was baked to the point where it could barely be chewed. The uni....let's not go there..... . Service was so-so, not the typical Japanese hospitality you'd expect. To make things worse, they made a mistake on our check as well that we had to correct their calculations.. . Go elsewhere if you're looking for palatable food.
If you want to hang out, go there at night and be prepared to wait.. . If you want to eat, go there when they open at 6pm.. . Having been to Japan (my son in the Navy was stationed there), I have to say the atmosphere, menu and ambiance, resembles a neighborhood Japanese eatery.. . Let's call this place for what it is. It's a Hipster's hangout that serves Japanese Tapas.  If you get really super hungry, bring your wallet.. . Sushi, is just so-so, but cooked entrees are good.. . Service is very "scattered", however, it's a lot more traditional and authentic then the typical Japanese place in Las Vegas, and certainly a better value than the places located on The Strip.. . Parking does suck, so I suggest not bothering and just parking in the lot of the center next door.. . If you don't want to wait, go the Korean Gardens BBQ, next door.
One of my fav places to eat. Great price. Great food. Haven't had a bad meal here. So many different selection. Only bad review is it gets busy during peak time. Hint. You can make RSVP.   Love the baby octopus salad with bachoy, fatty tuna sashimi, yellowtail tartar to name a few.
Great price, friendly service, and great food! Try their black cod and honey toast, two thumps up!
Came for a quick and light dinner.. . Good:. Stir fried garlic chicken gizzard.. . OK:. Black Cod. . Not so much:. Spicy deep fried chicken soft bone was bland.. Beef tongue was over salted.. . Sorry, LV.  LA has you beat.. I do want to come back and try more stuff. . So, we'll see......
I love this place. I always get their beef bowls. It's inexpensive but you have to get there early or go late because seating builds up. Just remember it's location on the upper level of the shopping plaza. It's a popular place and they also have pretty good sushi rolls. When I get the beef bowl, I also get the Vegas Unagi tempura roll. You can't fit the whole thing in your mouth. They tempura dip the lobster mix or crab mix (I forget) and it layers on top of the roll. It's also a great place to have a few cold ones with friends. Remember everything is not on the menu and do your best to read the selection cards that is taped around the restaurant.
This is my favorite sushi buffet spot in the United States. I know it sounds grand, but it's true.
If you don't want to wait, it's best you go there before 6pm, or any time on weekdays.. (You can also call and see if it's not crowded). . - - Edited on Apr 24 2014 - -. The hours has changed.. No more lunch hours.. Opens at 5pm, last call at 2:30am.. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - . My suggestion is, if you crave something and don't want to miss it, call and ask them before you go. (There can be groups of people ordering 20 beef tan skewers for each table, seriously.). . About the items on the wall, yes it is hard to read English since they are so tiny. If you are willing to read all that, prepare your glasses and take a walk. I would check yelp first since many items on the wall are already introduced WITH pictures (although prices are often wrong).. . But still, servers can help you picking so tell them what you want today. Servers there eat their food too so they can tell you what they think about the item you're about to order.. . Lastly, it's better if you tell the server about your allergy or veganism.. (i.g. Jalapeno fried rice comes with some shrimp heads on its plate.). . Hope this helps!
I came because of the great review on the food but sadly I was let down by a few of the dishes:. .  bok choy $3.95 = bad choice and a total rip-off! 1 large head of bok choy and a few scattered pieces drowned in salty soy sauce. . . famous beef tataki = thin slice beef; some unevenly cut; easy to swallow when dip in the ponzu sauce but the lemon-y condiment sauce with it made the entire bite taste like dish soap. . Yellowtail tuna tartare = very good combination with the crispy fried wonton sheet between rice and avocado, tuna mix. However, there was barely any pieces of tuna ( 3 tic tac size pieces at most) Presentation look ok but closely looking at it, the avocado mix look like someone vomit up some nasty green gloop.. . Ramen with the pork belly = nothing special that's worth $8 but it will fill you up so you don't have to order too much. . Chicken yakatori = a dried piece of chicken drowned in cheap store-bought teriyaki sauce. I took a bite and didn't want it anymore. . Honey toast =$8 probably the savor of the entire meal. crispy edges, enough honey to go with bread and vanilla ice cream compliments the bite. Towards the center, there is condensed milk that adds extra sweetness to it. Very filling-- 1 order can feed 4 people at most.. . $40 meal for 2 people = not worth the price to eat while in vegas. . . Service- f
Um, am I too lenient to easily hand out five stars to so many Izakayas in Las Vegas?. . But it would make me a liar if I'd call this place anything less than perfect. It's really authentic in vibe and any of items I randomly choose tastes exactly like one in Japan. For an establishment like this, execution is everything and Ichiza lives up to the hype.. . My only question is if this place is an amenity or destination for visitors. Locals like us are lucky to have Ichiza around.
