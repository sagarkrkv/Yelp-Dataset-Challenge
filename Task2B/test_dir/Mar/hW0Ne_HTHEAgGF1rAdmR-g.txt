We had a 2-3 hour layover on our way from Salt Lake to San Diego. This airport gets HOT inside! I had carry-on luggage so I changed into shorts! Cute gift shops
Us airways has horrible customer support. Airport is older and needs to be modernized. Their are power cords but you have to know how to find them. All that being said 3 stars for free and fast wifi.
To rate this airport you first have to understand the layout - there are separate terminals so depending on where you go you will have VASTLY differing experiences at each location.  That being said I mainly fly out of Terminal 2, and it is pretty awful.  My rating is based on this.  I fly in and out of Pheonix about 3-5 times a year and it is pretty consistently bad.  Terminal 2 is run down, and offers very little in the way of variety, the only redeeming quality is Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and Wendy's were added as eateries a while back which was great to get some decent variety.  The security line is always at a snails pace and last the several times I have been through it, the smell is horrendous, a mix between bad breath and bad cheese...why?!  Why does it smell like that?!  Hopefully some updates to this sad little gate will be made soon, since terminal 3 and terminal 4 are vast improvements and step-ups from the aptly named #2.
Lovely airport, when you're not on a) a weekend flight and b) can allow for 3 hours to prepare, especially for Southwest flights on a & b. I've gone to and from here for ~8 years and we've never had issues until the last 1-2 years. . I will admit, the shopping/culture/food scene has improved, but seems that service/prep has decreased. Southwest has consistently decreased the number of available terminals for flight check-in during their peak hours. Case in point, Sunday AM -- we waited 45minutes just to get to a check-in terminal, to be forced to run to security & wait an add'l 30 minutes. Used to be we could be at the airport and sitting in a seat at the gate in the same timeframe. Come on, Sky Harbor!
Phoenix Sky Harbor was a decent enough airport, not the best I've been to, and certainly not the worst.. . We flew by way of Spirit Air from ORD -- PHX on Saturday February 22nd.  We were delayed leaving Chicago, so late arriving at Sky Harbor.  At 1:30am, it was a lot busier than I thought it was going to be, yet none of the shops were open.  Just a lot of people around.  Maybe Phoenix has a lot of red-eye flights?. . Our return flight on Wednesday, February 26th (the red-eye, leaving PHX at 1:39am) was on-time, and we even pushed back from the gate early.  Again, the shops weren't open, but there were a ton of people around.. . The staff I did encounter was friendly, security was easy to get through, and the terminal was clean.  That's really all you can ask for.
I grew up in Phoenix in the 90s before it became the LA-Wannabe Hellscape it is today and this airport, which I have flown out of my entire life, is a reflection of what my old hometown has morphed into, which makes me sad and angry at the same time.. . Whoever thinks growth is a sign of progress just needs to go through the travel flight process here.. . The gate staff here are the most disorganized I have ever seen, the layout is absolutely not conducive to this airport's size, the constant gate changing makes me think whoever controls that sort of thing here is either a brain dead monkey punching random buttons w/numbers or someone who should get assistance w/their job..  . The security lines here are a joke and when the travel weather apocalypse that hit here a couple of days ago came through, none of the staff or services here seemed prepared. The heat in the TSA line was intolerable...and nobody seemed to care that we, the herded sheep masses, were slowly heat-stroking out.. . And don't even get me started on the debacle that is the shuttle pick up point in Terminal 4.   . . The only thing this place has going for it anymore is the free wifi and elderly volunteers in purple jackets.
The good: helpful airport personnel, good restaurants (esp. Terminal 4), several options for parking, easy access to terminal 4 via sky train. The bad: VERY confusing layout to drive through. I've lived here since 2006 and still use gps plus lots of cursing to navigate into and out of the airport.
Terminal 2 is absolutely the worst terminal ever. It took over an hour to get through security. They were making people that were TSA approved still remove their shoes. And there are no places to eat pre security. DONT FLY OUT OF THIS TERMINAL.
I like fliying out of terminal 2, so easy to get trough security and the long term parking lot is so close and easy to get in and out.. I love Alaska Airlines
It would be nice if in Terminal 4 on the C gates they had more of a food selection for those of us at the mercy of Southwest Airlines.  There is just one small bar, maybe 6 bar seats and that is it.  Overpriced boring sandwiches and that is about it.
Been flying in and out of this airport for the past 6 yrs.  The only positive thing about this place is that it's right off the freeway.  With that said, they have the ABSOLUTE worst check-in process at the security gate.  There's no getting around it.  You'll be in line for a solid 45 min to an hour so plan accordingly.
I was pleasantly surprised by how efficient and friendly this airport was!  Granted, we showed up at the United terminal a bit early, but we didn't have to wait on any sort of line to check our bags, and the attendant was very helpful.  Security was quick and painless - again, no line, and none of the typical TSA douchery.  The airport is clean and has a good selection of places to eat...nothing fancy as far as I saw, but I'm more concerned about getting on my flight than having a 5-star dining experience.  Overall, a stress-free experience that eases the pain of the multiple hours of travel I have ahead.
Thisis only my third time coming here to this airport it's pretty clean and wasn't too busy when we got here, not like LAX in Los Angeles. The only thing that I didn't like was winding down exit the parking garage, like they have in Seatac airport in Seattle other than that it is ok we will be here for a good while I will keep my eyes open for more.
I wish I could give half stars but alas I can't. Unfortunately I must round down to 3 stars when it comes to Phoenix airport simply because of the limited food options and size. . . Phoenix is easy to navigate and go from terminal to terminal. Small enough that you don't have to wait too long in security. However,  the size of their gates leaves a lot to be desired. Tiny! When you have 300 people waiting for a flight and the gate barely has enough seats for 50 there will be issues. . . Heaven forbid a flight is cancelled. Talk about crowded. I could barely breathe. My flight was delayed (thanks O Hare airport for cancelling some flights-per usual) and I went on the short hunt for food. . . Let's see...you have fast food and....fast food. Yuck. After roaming around for about 15 minutes I walked to another terminal and found a semi healthy offering. Some sandwiches and salads. However, it took another 20 minutes for a panini. Sigh. . . Bonus points for free wifi. . . Give me more food options for those times when I'm delayed and more space to stretch out at the gate and I'll give this an upgrade.
Never been outside of this airport, only been through here on occasions to connect to another flight. The airport itself is more onthe modern side. Plenty of restaurants to choose from, clean bathrooms, and efficient walkways.
Nice, big international airport.  Close to Phoenix, off sight rental cars and great restaurants and amenities. Tram service because the airport is so large and spread out.  TSA lines were abnormally long and short staffed to say the least....15-20 minutes to go thru security is too long!
I love this airport!  It's so simple to drop-off and pick-up and there's always plenty of cell phone parking!  It's a major hub and I can easily get a non-stop to just about anywhere in the world!  Plus, it's only 15 min from my house!
Sky Harbor is an a-ok place. I mean it is big, the car rentals are miles away and luggage took a long time and it was just downright busy, but it's a major airport, so it is to be expected.   . . The good: . - Lots of food options, especially before security.  . - Security was smooth and didn't have huge lines. - It is a big airport so you get all the big (and small) airlines. - Free wi-fi . . The meh: . - The car rentals are miles from the airport and require a shuttle - so that adds a lot of time getting your car and returning it. . - It was a bit of a maze the drive around, but then again I am a tourist, maybe it is just that I don't drive it all the time.. - Luggage seemed really slow, but then again, doesn't it everywhere! . . It was fine, but I might opt for one of the smaller regional airports to skip the car rental annoyance and traffic.
Phoenix Airport is getting better day by day.  I primarily use Terminal 4.  Security check points are great if staffed properly.  Terminal 4 food has done a 360 since last year, all new eateries on every concourse! So pick your poison.  I love the new Blanco's Taqueria on the low A concourse, new windows with lots of natural light coming in. The gate areas could use come updating, more power ports are needed.
Arrive early for terminal D - TSA lacks leadership so it's a cluster fuck!. . *************************************************************************************************************************. . Above was my check in tip.  Below is what Lacey H. sent me.  She is a TSA agent in the airport.  When you read all the reviews on the airport, seems my opinion of the TSA organization is an opinion shared by many.  Having Lacey H. say what she did makes it even more apparent at the lack of professionalism in the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.  . . This is not a slam against the TSA in total, as they do a terrific job in many many airports.  This is specifically a leadership issue in Phoenix. . . Thanks Lacey for supporting my review!  . . ***********************************************************************************************************************. . . You're Cool 3/10/2014.  Photo of Lacey H.. 3 friends. 21 reviews. Lacey H.. Gilbert, AZ. Send Message. For your tip at: Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. . I think it's really amazing and very insightful of you to notice that it is tsa that is to blame for security lines and not the disorganized idiot passengers who arrive late to the airport and expect everyone to cater to their lack of adequate planning and preparation. Amazing!
Love flying in and out of this airport.
This is a fair airport; it's old, the security moves at medium speed, the food is not very good.  As large airports go, it's just older and grosser than most.  Its poorly lit and feels "sweaty."  I would give it 1 star for the airport and 1 star for the free wifi.  It needs an update, which I think is coming, as they are collecting survey data right now to that end.  Please complete the survey an tell them to make it like MSP's new terminal!
Nary a stumble upon arrival.  All avenues are clearly marked.  I'd agree with the nickname of America's friendliest airport.  Everyone from security to the rental shuttle driver gets a big thumbs up.  So, arrival was smooth.  Hope departure runs the same.
Couple huge knocks for this airport. The car rental was literally a 15 minute bus ride (far enough way you need to add at least 30-45 minutes to your return trip to make sure you can get there in time). Other huge knock is that most of the food was outside security, which is a peeve of mine. My preference is to get thru security, get thru the headache, and then go eat and drink on the other side. . . Everything else here was fine. There were some comfy couches near the gate that had builtin plugs for your gear, and free wifi.
A fabulous airport. Eat at Chelsea's kitchen if you have a minute or get take out if you don't. TSA was pleasant, jovial and quick - how often can you say that?
I love the purple Blazer wearing oldsters who volunteer in the airport.  They are so helpful and sweet.  The signage is pretty good as well,  so with these two amenities is nearly impossible to get lost.  The shops are excellent and the people are generally quite nice.  It dulls the sting of having to be in Phoenix which is blazing hot,  and the antithesis of the red head weather that I need to keep my hair from bleaching to blonde and my face from shriveling up like an old boot.. Another plus are the weird comedian bus drivers.  I laughed my head of at their corny old man jokes all the way to and from the rental car place.
I'll never be back. Arizona is bad enough enough on its own right, but this place and it's f'd up car rental system takes the cake.
Clean, easy to navigate, and uncrowded.  However, you should plan on LOTS of walking when switching terminals!
It took me a bit of traveling before I really started to appreciate this airport. Here are the finer aspects that set Sky Harbor apart from most travel hubs.. . +Local dining. You get a real feel for the area's cuisine. Not just with the authentic Mexican or delicious Tex Mex options, but with local pizza, and stuff like La Grande Orange. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sea of Sbarro's/McDonald's/Starbucks and other chains as my only options. . . +It's near the center of the city. Most airports are at least a half hour drive outside of any significant neighborhood. That means when your destination is Phoenix, it's very easy to get around. There are even very affordable shuttle services to take you to Flagstaff/Tucson. . . +No matter where your gate is, you will have adequate seating, places to charge your phone, and places to shop. . . Of course, not everything is peachy keen. . . -I have had longer waits for security and baggage claim here than any other airport I've been to. . . -WiFi blows, but to be fair it blows at a lot of airports. . . Overall, the worst part about being here is the need to have some patience for getting through luggage and security. Other than that, it's a nice place!
I Love love love this airport! They have really made some great renovations to make this a decent layover stop. So many great new local joints here. Blanco. Olive and Ivy. Modern Burger. Dilly's Deli. Chelsea's Kitchen. Tammie & Co. Now all they need is to add a Potbelly's.
I travel a lot and this is definitely one of my favorite domestic airports.. . They have done an excellent job by replacing the standard, generic restaurants with my local favorite restaurants.  Tamie Coe baked goods!!!  Four Peaks!!!  Matt's Big Breakfast!!!. . Pros:  Free wifi, four separate security checkpoints in Terminal (each with a TSA pre-check lane!), very easy to get in and out, excellent food options, the lightrail finally connects from the 44th St parking garage through long term parking to here.. . Cons:  They are still connecting the the light rail to Terminals 3 & 2.
It can be clogged up like any other airport but they do have great places to eat if your willing to try new places rather than the fast food stuff also have the time.
C gates at terminal 4 have limited food options though there are new restaurants are being built
I've lived in Phoenix for the last 10 years, thus I have flown in & out of Sky Harbor multiple times or picked up friends and family. Sky Harbor is a major hub and is always busy! I think this is a much older airport than most carpeting and fixtures are outdated. However, I'm sure with the completing of the new tram shuttle line the airport will be given a make over at least this is my hope. . . The high points are You can reach most departure gates going through baggage claim of the arrivals side. there are 2 cell phone lots on either wing of the airport for waiting. Lastly if you're in a hurry you can maneuver through traffic by routing through the airport reaching the 51,202, 10, & 143 depending on which direction your headed to or coming from.
