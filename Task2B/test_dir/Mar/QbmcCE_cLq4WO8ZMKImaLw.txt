Overrated. Ein Wort beschreibt das Lokal fur mich sehr gut, aber ich fuhre das gerne noch weiter aus: das Hash Hash verspricht Farm Food with a twist, das bedeutet, man mixt traditionelle amerikanische Hausmannskost durcheinander und verkauft das als innovativ. Das Signature Dish ist die Chicken Waffel, das ist fritiertes Huhn auf drei Waffeln, die mit Speck gefullt sind. Ganz ehrlich, das passt einfach nicht zusammen fur mich. Ich habe mich deshalb auch fur ein anderes Gericht, einen Hash mit Huhnerfleisch, Spargel und Gemuse entschieden, das war dann aber auch bestenfalls Durchschnitt. . . Positiv anzumerken ist das kostenlose Wifi und der bemuhte Service.
Thus place worked us out for breakfast on our last day of a bachelorette party. Bypass the line for a table and head for the bar. Jason is the bomb and he will not steer you wrong on what to order. He recommended the best orange/ tangerine/ champagne cocktail ever followed by the best breakfast we've ever had in Vegas. This place is not to be missed. I had a pancake that was bigger than a tractor tire!!!
Twisted Farm Food.. this place gets me every time I am in Vegas! The sage fried chicken on top of a tower (yes, tower) of bacon waffles, and topped with warm maple syrup... OH MAN! I have tried so many things on the menu, and they are all great! But the Chicken and Waffles have a special place in my heart and I get weak every time I walk in. That's not all.. they have the BEST Bloody Mary I have ever had! Perfect every time! Not a drinker? They have a s'mores mocha... the marshmallows are toasted and overflowing on top of the coffee mug! So many options.. its a great place to go!
This review is solely on the service and wait. I still gave them three stars because as we were waiting, we saw guests leaving very satisfied and saying "worth the wait...delicious food...I'm stuffed." Unfortunately, we never made it in.. . Sooo I knew we were going to have to wait a while because it was packed and we were a party of 8. The hostess said it would be about an hour and a half. So we waited...and waited.... . Meanwhile, a big party that checked in after us got seated before us. . . But we waited some more...and waited.. . Finally, one of us went to ask the hostess how much longer it would be. She told us 30 on top of how long we already waited. So we decided to wait an extra 30 since we were so close!!. . We waited...and waited. 30 minutes went by and they still didn't call is. Another one of us went to double check if it would be soon. We were all getting very hungry. . . And this time the hostess told us 45 minutes!!! And we told her that someone had told us 30 minutes ago, that it was 30 minutes. She just looked at him and said it would be ABOUT 45 more minutes.. . Needless to say, after losing over two hours of our day on just waiting to get in..we gave up and went somewhere else.. . It was pretty upsetting because I was looking forward to eating here after reading reviews and hearing such satisfaction.
I am a sucker for Hash House, and I wish there was one near where I live.  I would be gianormous if there was one.  All the food is amazing, just look at the menu, stare at all the plates that go by, its hard to just pick one thing for breakfast!!. . I definitely recommend getting here as early as you can for breakfast, otherwise there is going to be a long wait.  But you know what, if there is a wait, I suggest you wait anyways the food it good! . . Ordered a BLT Mary and Corned Beef Hash, tasty!!  The bloody MAry was cute, they dressed it up and put the "sandwich fixings" on the side just like you could make a liquid sandwich.. . Portions are big so if you dont have a big appetite or a hangover you may want to share something, otherwise NOM ON!!
Chicken n Waffles were excellent. Only nitpick is chicken was a bit dry. Friendly, efficient service. Would go back.
I was so happy to find a new, fun breakfast spot in Vegas. We were staying at Nobu, so we basically had to go outside and then right into the Quad to get to HH. I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of food we received, but everything was delicious. The atmosphere is quaint and diner-esque, and there were all kinds of people inside, which was really nice.. . I had the avocado and bacon scramble with fried potatoes and fresh fruit, and my friend had the chorizo hash. Both dishes were huge, really pretty, and extremely tasty. I sampled some of the hot teas as well. The orange spice was my favorite! It was the perfect blend of sweet and spice. My friend had the house s'mores mocha, and the thing was massive. Massive!  I don't think I've ever seen a mug quite so large. It was fantastic as well, and had tons of ooey gooey marshmallows on top.. . I would love to go back and try pancakes or something. I'm sure they are delicious as well. I am thinking this will be a new breakfast spot for us in future Vegas trips to come.
This place is a little piece of heaven to me. Breakfast is my favorite meal, so much that so that just "a little" breakfast doesn't do it for me. I'm used to bacon/eggs/toast/grits with a side of bacon, maybe it's my grandma's southern blood in me. When the waitress explained the menu here to us, she pointed out a particular section and said something along the lines of "be careful, this is a lot of food." I had already selected something else not from said section, so natuarlly my thought became, "Uh oh... I must not have ordered enough..." Boy was I wrong. What Hash House must categroize as "not a lot of food" is enough to feed a small country.  . . It's like getting two meals at once. I can be a pretty big eater and this breakfast had me satisified until dinner time. . . Not only are the portions substantial, but the food is good too. This is not slop - it's well put together dishes with tasty sides and a lot of flavor. The fried chicken and waffles is their signature dish, but i decided to go "lighter" with the fried chicken and mashed potatoes and i was not dissappointed.. . This is a great spot and i definitely recommend. Try going early (pre 8 AM) if you want to avoid the breakfast crowd on the weekends.
This was a great choice on my Vegas trip.  I was happy that the waiter told me ahead of time that the portions were easily enough for 2 people.  For $18 a plate with no extra charge to share this turned out to be a great deal.  The food was amazing too.  I had the sage chicken eggs benedict and loved every bite!  The reason I wasn't as happy with the place was because of the extremely long wait to get into breakfast and the length of time it took to get my food.  Luckily there is a bar setup to allow people to get bloody mary's while you wait.  We decided to go to Starbucks across the street and come back.  But I think this place is a better deal than the buffets and better quality food.
Couldn't sit us..very unhappy with the customer service here. I wouldn't recommend this place they're very mean to there customers who have been waiting for a long time..
Portions are way to big and I had a dead fruit fly on my food, ill never visit again ill make sure I tell all my friends and family. Overpriced for poor food
I came here on a recommendation for a reasonably priced breakfast place in Vegas. It was a bonus that there is a location in the Quad hotel. . . When arriving my girlfriend and I were told that there was a 35-45 minute wait. However, it was a pleasant surprise to get seated within 15 minutes.. . Our server (also a bartender) brought coffee and water immediately. He did an excellent job throughout the meal. . . The food was amazing. I had the fried chicken Benedict and it was enormous. It could definitely be shared by two (or more) people. I did my best to finish it but alas I failed.. . The entree consisted of two homemade biscuits a fried chicken breast, two poached eggs, cheese and Benedict sauce. Whoa! . . Looking forward to my next experience when I return to Las Vegas.. . Two thumbs up!
Despite all the fantastic reviews, I refuse to force myself onto the "A Go Go" hype.  The aesthetics of every plate is amazing, however I find it unpractical and more or less of a disturbance to eat around (or figure out of how eat).   . . I wanted to try this place out for quite some time now, especially since a ton of my facebook friend's have been checking in and promising how delicious their chicken and waffles are so on my last day in Vegas I decided to make a detour to the airport and grab myself a brunch with a well needed bloody marry. . . 1.  Parking.  You're forced to park inside of the Quad Resort parking lot and if you have a large vehicle I'm pretty sure security will harass you to make you not park in their three story parking lot (They did that to my brother in law).. . 2.  It's a maze just to get to the restaurant.  Gotta walk through a hall way, go up a fancy elevator, then go into some corridor to get to another elevator, walk through a casino, walk up a flight of stairs and then boom, you've found waldo.  . . 3.  No bathrooms.  Nope.  No restrooms in the restaurant.  You've gotta manage your way down the stairs, across the casino, and walk through a little mini shopping strip just to get to the restrooms.  . . 4.  When I stopped by their filter in the water was down.  No complementary water, so you're forced to shell out the $3 for a bottle of water. And if you do decide to order that bottle of water, think nothing much of it 'cause it's more like an 8 oz. bottle.  No refills, just blow another $3.. . 5.  Ordered the chicken and waffles.  For some odd reason there was an over exaggerated amount of rosemary and onion spread throughout my plate.  The syrup was less than half filled in the small condiment cup and when I asked for another one (since I was sharing with my boyfriend), it took them 5 minutes to bring us another small cup of syrup.  By then, the chicken and waffle was cold.  Oh, weren't we supposed to have eating utensils too?  That took another 10 minutes to get that and an additional plate to eat with.  . . 6.  I found their bloody marry's to be quite delicious, however I didn't need the collectors cup (which I didn't know was at an additional fee...heck, I didn't even know that there was a regular plane jane bloody marry) so I ordered another one.  Took a long amount of time to get that second and when I asked the server to rinse out my "collectors" cup, he forgot to come back and get it rinsed for me so I had to ask again.. . Maybe I just had an off the wall bad experience, maybe not?  But I'm pretty sure the next time I crave for chicken and waffles, I'll just buy a box of Krusteez and a small box of Popeyes chicken.
I had to come and see what the fuss was about. I have heard of the huge portion size, but the food is touted as better than most. I am usually disappointed by places like this, but it really was good. I had the meatloaf, which was awesome. The pancakes are 18 inches across and the banana brown sugar is by far the best of those. Biscuits are heavy and roughly the size of a softball. What surprised me most about Hash wad the pricing. I swear I would spend more at Denny's. Awesome bang for your buck in the town that takes all your money. Can't wait to come back and try some other entrees!
Horrible enough said and they have the nerve to sale chicken and waffles. If I was the food police they would be banded from making horrible chicken and waffles
Big portions, great food, crowded as all get out.. . Tip:  Get a Total Rewards Platinum Card and skip the line...also thumb your nose at the people in the long line as you pass on through as though youare Thurston Howell playing through at the Pebble Beach Golf Course.. . Get the Fried Chicken Benedict or the Chicken and Waffles.  The Benedict is a lot of freakin food, and gets cold quick if you don't hoover it.  The Chicken and Waffles seems to hold together fairly well.  Don't think this is a classy joint...because it isn't.  This is a spit on the floor and curse at your friends kind of place...but it has great food.  Lots of freakin kids too.  Also...it is in the Quad, which means it is the best thing in the Quad....because the Quad is the 9th Circle of Hell.
We LOVE this place. We never come to Vegas without visiting! Dinner is our favorite as you get more bang for your buck! We took friends with us and told them to get the meatloaf (AMAZING), they opted for the Sage Chicken and waffles and were disappointed! The meatloaf is our favorite. Their salads are good and their burgers are good. Breakfast is Delish but not quite as much bang for your buck! ALL plates are big enough to share!!
Not sure why all the good reviews. Basic comfort food, way over priced and nothing amazing, though portions are large. Chicken and waffles (their speciality) was just plain bad, chicken was super dry. Also service was slow and very rude. Waitress kept asking us of we were done since her shift was ending and needed to get our check done. Word to the wise avoid this place.
Meh.  The wait was reasonable. The service was good.   The food was not great. I had the banana French toast which was good, but the bacon didn't come crispy as I requested. The blueberry pancakes were dry. It was a real let down for a Las Vegas breakfast spot. Go to The egg and I on Sahara instead.
The portions were very gracious and the food was great. Our waitress was Lusia, she was very attentive, friendly and made great suggestions while answering all of our questions.
The Sage chicken and waffles are AMAZING. Jose one of the managers was very helpful and hospitable. I will definitely be back soon!
I've dined here twice when I visited Vegas and thought it was pretty good! Honestly, I can't quiet remember what I ordered both times (yikes, Vegas does that to me sometimes!) but I vaguely remember the first time I came here I split with the BF and whatever we ordered had fried tomatoes. It was yummy!. . The second time, I believe I ordered one of the benedicts and I smashed it! The gravy was good! Sorry that's pretty much all I remember :(. . What I do remember like it was yesterday is the bloody mary! Great flavors! I love a chunky, heavy bloody mary with lots of yummy pickles and toppings. This one hit the spot for sure! :)
We walked like 2 miles to get here because we heard it was the best breakfast to get nearby the strip.  It's not in the nicest hotel/casino on the prettiest part of the strip (I think it's actually on the old strip) but don't let that deter you.. . We got in on a Sunday at about 1:30, and it was PAH-ACKED with people.  They told us the wait would be 45-60 minutes so three of us sat in the waiting room, and the other two went to the bar for coffee.  They came back a minute later and said there was enough room for 5 of us to eat at the bar, which was probably the best seat in the house - great service. Kye and Tiffany at the bar are awesome. . . We had drinks, friendly convo with the bartenders, and our food was delivered quickly. ..and BOY was it HUGE!!  Every plate could have been shared by 2-3 people and the banana pancake (singular) that the guy next to us got was literally *hanging* off the edges of the plate. . . I got the Roast Chicken Potato hash: chicken, mushrooms, red peppers and asparagus on top of roasted potatoes. Over medium well egg (?) and large biscuit on the side.  Oh and don't forget the wedge of watermelon!  Those things were also cocktail ornaments. I am not kidding.. . The best thing about any place in Vegas, I sadly only took advantage of here, was the to-go alcohol cups. Wacky... especially coming from GA (aka the Bible Belt).  I felt like I was being really bad, but I liked it. . . The only bad thing?  The whole place was really warm.. maybe because it's on the top floor, and we were sitting at the bar (by the kitchen door.)  Bar is still worth it!
Overrated!  Went here for brunch, told 30 minute wait, but to keep an eye on the bar as it'sfirst come first served. After 15 minutes 2 people stood up at the bar and 2 people raced past me and took the spots. So the bar seating is a fiasco. . . Finally got a seat at bar as no table was open after 35 minutes   Already had perused the menu during the wait so ordered when was greeted. Waited 35 minutes for the hash which was good but not great. Meanwhile I was swarmed by early morning drunks ordering drinks at the bar.  . . Never again.
My boyfriend and I got the corned beef hash to split. It was good but nothing to rave about or go out of my way for. The portion was huge, which was a definite plus. It had corned beef hash with country fried potatoes, an egg and a biscuit on the side.. . The wait time is absolutely ridiculous here until it hits about 10 pm. From then til about 5 am, your in the clear and I say go for it!. . Located inside of The Quad, on the second floor. . The inside is relatively on the small side considering how popular this place is.. . I would probably come back again, but try something different.
We had just flown in from Houston and put our luggage in the hotel and decided we really needed some food. It was about 10 PM, so naturally I wanted breakfast. I love good corned beef hash, so this place, which was a block away seemed perfect. "Farm fresh with a twist." So I had the Pacers Hash, which was okay...a little bland. But it came out really fast, but was cold. Not cold, cold...but lukewarm...edible, but not right. Michelle had the giant Griddle Cheese Sandwich. Looked delicious with tomatoes and avocados. But the waiter, who had run through a few sides offered with that when we ordered, brought her fries instead of a salad. It was late and we were tired, so Michelle didn't point this out and just ate her sandwich. The waiter was a nice guy, very friendly. But he only had two tables and seemed much more concerned with being behind the bar, even though there were no bar customers, than he was with waiting his two tables. He wasn't slow or neglectful, just not as on top of things as maybe he should have been. Overall, a so-so experience.
"Throw one at me if you want, hash head. I've got all five senses and I slept last night, that puts me six up on the lot of you." -- Brick (2005). . Brunch. Vegas. Hangover-worthy. Hair of the dog. Welcome to Hash House a Go Go. I had checked into my hotel on Yelp, it posted on Twitter and a friend recommended we come down to The Quad and eat here.  Looks Good!  And off we walked.  We took a leisurely stroll from Mandalay Bay all the way up the strip and into The Quad and found HHAGG.  Wowza, it was packed.  We put in our name (5 people) and they told us 45 minutes to an hour.  They directed us to the left to order a cocktail while we waited and were told there might be a place to sit down in the bar.  A couple of us went in to get coffees and found us 5 seats at the bar - Score!. . We sat down and were introduced to Kye, with her spiky locks, and Tiffany - a duo full of personality and who "pour the cocktails like we like to drink them!"  Okay, I'm sold!  A couple of us ordered Irish coffees - knock me on my ass - while we perused the menu.  So many options.  Thanks to Yelp, I had narrowed it down and knew I wanted the Sage Fried Chicken - problem is that it appears in 4 different places on the menu!! Oy!. . After much debate, and recommendations from Tiffany, I opted for something from the "Indiana Favorites" section of the menu.  This was the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit.  I asked for my eggs to be scrambled with cheddar cheese.  When the plate came - holy moly that's a lotta food!  The biscuit was the size of a softball with a sprig of rosemary stuck in the top.  . . The potatoes were delightful - smashed and the bacon was not super crispy, which I love. The reduction of maple was like crack.  The eggs were perfectly cooked and salted - they did need some pepper.  As for the chicken, it was not fried enough.  The crust was a bit doughy and tasted of flour - clearly they were dealing with a lot of covers and quality control suffered. Not acceptable.  Luckily, the rest of my meal was great, but I would probably go with something else next time.  My friend got the pork tenderloin - impeccably fried.  Golden brown and delicious!. . Now let's talk cocktails - strong, powerful, strong.  We enjoyed ourselves so much with Kye and Tiffany, we started doing shots.  Watching them craft drinks and deliver food - I wanted to come back over and over and try every food item and fancy drink.  Plus, they were a delight to talk to and have serve us.. . I'll be going back each trip for sure and I have already recommended it to a friend going to Vegas in a couple of weeks. HHAGG is the place to eat.
You must come here for the food. The wait is a let down. Especially if you have a group. We waited an hour and twenty minutes for a table. Then another hour for food. They really seemed short staffed, but I can't fault our server for that. She did what she could but gets a star deducted. Didn't want to spend that much time waiting on a meal. I suggest sharing as the plates are nicely sized.  The Man vs Food entree has to be eaten. It's good!  Sage fried chicken Benedict! Yum.
We had this place bookmarked as it was on Man vs Food and were so excited we were finally able to check it out.  We came in and had to wait for maybe about 30 minutes as this place was super packed!  No worries, they were serving Bloody Marys and Screwdrivers while you wait!  These drinks are stiff.  We were finally seated and greeted by our waiter.  I of course ordered the Griddled French toast that is dipped in banana cinnamon cream and came with pecan maple syrup.  Oh my, the French toast was fantastic.  Love it and the portion was huge.  My hubby of course ordered the Sage Chicken Benedict and really enjoyed it.  The chipotle cream was really good and flavorful.  Everything here was really good and we both walked out in a food coma.  Perfect time to walk it out on The Strip! LOL
It was okay I heard so many good reviews and so I wanted to come and see for myself . I got the snickers flapjack with biscuits and sausage gravy they were okay nothing amazing though I've definitely had better in my hometown so I was not impressed . . Our waiter was great very helpful
At first I thought Hash House A Go Go was going to be a letdown, or just another diner type place that got over hyped. I mean, it was crazy crowded and we'd probably be neglected. To my delight, the reality was that the foodwas amazing and the service was above and beyond, thanks to our awesome server, Kai. . . When we arrived around 10 on a Saturday, there was a 30 minute wait. We expected as much, but I needed coffee desperately. The hostess said we could get some at the bar, so I sidled up and ordered from Kai, who informed me that the bar was first come first serve and encouraged us to hang out there. We soon found 2 stools and everything just kept getting better and better. My wife ordered a hazelnut latte to start. It was without any doubt the best hazelnut beverage I have ever tried. It tasted natural, actually like hazelnuts, and was just fantastic. . . And then the food came. All those reviews that tell you to split a plate with someone are right. Split a plate! I got the chicken and waffles, and they were as good as everyone else has already said. I can't recommend it enough. But there was more than enough food for 2 people on that glorious plate. The waffles had strips of bacon in them. Come on! So those were obviously great. And the chicken was perfect too. Fried just right, moist and tender, with crisp, savory breading. Pour some syrup on that pile of food and get ready to smile because you are in for a treat. This is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had, and the price was a downright bargain by Vegas standards. Throughout, Kai checked in with us, bantered and generally made us feel comfortable, like we were with friends. Between the food, drinks, and the completely awesome service, Hash House nails it.
OMG! Food was amazing!  Highly recommend the sage chicken Benedict, chicken n waffles and banana pancake!  So yummy.. We split these three dishes by four ppl and has plenty!  Big servings!  Oh get a spicy Bloody Mary too!! Yummy breakfast will definitely return!!!!
Huge portions, yummy food, great recommendations from out server, Travis. We arrived around 3pm on a Friday and had no wait, but returned on Saturday and it was PACKED! Would definitely go back during the week between meal times to avoid the wait again. It deserves all the hype!
One of the best breakfast places in all of Vegas. Portions are huge and food is delicious. Well worth the wait.
Yelp let me down on this one. If i'm rating the portion size I will give this place 5 star. Every plate that came out is at least good for 2 people unless you're Adam from Man vs. Food. I ordered the sage fried chicken and it was cold, and extremely dry that I took a bite and just put aside. My husband ordered the biscuit and gravy also only had a few bites and we left.
This place made me hash house a go go to the bathroom. Okay that may not even be true but I wanted to write it anyway.. . Not a surprise that we stumbled in here at around 2am on a Friday. I was with a group of seven, though that really only counted in terms of bodies. There were about three functioning brains in total. Then a few girls came and joined us. One of them knew my brother. Somehow that made the functioning brain count go down one. Boom! Take that, girls that I don't know at all!. . I ordered some eggs and they actually weren't that bad. They weren't that good, either. But again, 2am. So whatever.. . Every single plate that came to the table had a piece of watermelon, a strawberry, and a giant sprig of rosemary. Every plate. Not sure why. The guy who orders things must have a connection with the guy who distributes those things.. . Strawberries and watermelon are not in season (actually, does Las Vegas have a fruit season at all? can produce grow amidst despair?). . Rosemary...well that would have been fine, except that every indication on the menu suggested that it would be sage. Sage waffles. Sage chicken. Sage this, sage that.. . But then it turns out it was all rosemaried instead.. . Computers went down at 2:45. Computers came back up at 3:00. There is no bathroom in the whole restaurant. I think that is illegal in California. But we were not in California. We were in a hash house in Nevada.
Chicken n waffles and Chicken Benedict great at 300 am. Play some roulette at O'Shea's , they paid for this meal.
been here a couple times for bkfst/ brunch . the sage fried chicken n waffles is massive!!! good for 3 people at least stacked high fried chicken waffles bacon eggs awesome . Other items the farm scrabbles are good with biscuit (which could be more moist) kind of dry the few times I had it . Overall very good faster service using diamond preferred
If I can only share one "what happens in Vegas" moment (some don't like social networks haha) I will publicize this: Hash House Is the BEST 24hr eatery on the strip. As a fan of the San Diego location and of chicken and waffles I was so "down" to get my grub on here! . Located in the Quad next to the Flamingo, the location is PERFECT! If you know Vegas you know Caesars Palace, the Venetian and the new O'sheas is all just steps away... Oops talking about the trip anyway, I liked that the restaurant is large and spacious. The service is prompt and courteous and as expected the portions are HUMONGOUS! If you have not experienced Hash House A Go Go you are really missing out. Really.
Literally, just got back from dining here & it was delicious!  Went solo & grabbed a seat at the bar as soon as I walked in - although the place was PACKED!!  Crystal & Mark were my bartendars/servers & they were awesome!  Had the sundried-tomato, basil & goat cheese scramble with potatoes & a biscuit.  And what meal would be complete without a pineapple mimosa - YUM!  It was so good I'm going back & taking my boyfriend with me!
"Hey, My name is Christian, I'm your server, I make the best Bloody Mary in Las Vegas, and meat loaf here is the only meat loaf I eat outside of my Momma's. The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is what we are famous for because it was on TV. What can I start you with?!?". . Umm....Yes, Bloody Mary! . . Hash House A Go Go was delicious!Everything about my experience there was unique and worth every penny!!! My service was fantastic. The food was delicious (yet starchy - so paleo peeps beware!)!!. . My server knew what he was talking about...he knew how to recommend it, and he didn't hesitate in answering my questions! I will definitely be back!
All of my excitement about Hash House was unwarranted. After a 45 minute wait, we ordered our food immediately because my husband had a poker tournament to make. Despite ordering right away and informing our waiter of our slight time crunch, my husband's food came in 45 minutes and mine in 55 minutes. By the time my food came, my hubby had to leave to make the tournament he signed up for... I ate my chicken and waffles alone. (To be fair, we probably should have known better than to come somewhere like this with a schedule to keep.). . In a nutshell, my problems with HH:. 1) Average food. Chicken and waffles and corned beef were good but not great. Expensive for average food.. 2) Poor customer service. Lots of staff running everywhere with little getting accomplished. While we were waiting, I was at the front bar to order a drink and had to interrupt a lipstick application gossip fest among the front staff to ask where the bartender had gone. Our waiter came by 3x to tell us our food was coming and it was still 15 minutes until the first dish came out. When I voiced my frustration about the wait for our food, it barely registered. No offer to make our experience better. Only a sheepish apology as our server ran off to run my credit card.. . It must be nice to give terrible service and still have a crowded restaurant and celebrity guests. . . My advice, don't waste your time. Take your business somewhere that will appreciate your presence.
This place has gained so much Popularity that we felt guilty for not trying, so we made the reservation the day before and showed up on time.  The place was packed but they sat us down in less then five minutes, great deal.  First thing I noticed is that the music is too loud and everyone is screaming around you to carry a normal conversation.  We ordered almost right away and then it took 45 minutes to get the food.  The portions were huge, even the kids menu items.  Taste wise, everything was solid 3 stars but value is 5.  You could actually share a meal with another person and both be satisfied.  My honest opinion, a lot of hype not enough substance.  Another 45 minutes here and the noise would have driven me crazy.  See pics for the dishes we ordered.
Great food and drinks....everything is massive!  They are the room service for the hotel as well.  The BBBBLT was perfect for refueling around 10PM.
Country style! Good food...
This was a great place to eat! I had the meatloaf sandwich and it was amazing! I've never had a meatloaf sandwich before and this was yummy!!! The service was great, the wait was not to long, but worth it, and it was delicious!. .  A must go when in Vegas!!
Everyone is right on with 4 stars.   We had the Meatloaf (shared...it is HUGE) and it was good.  Added a couple of eggs and it was perfect.   I am not a big "star effer" but HHAGG is.  Pics with signatures everywhere (this is vegas, it doesn't surprise me that movie stars have to eat somewhere)   slammed into your face.  That is the -1 star.  Some people I bet enjoy this but really....WHO CARES?
HUGE portions and the wait was ridiculous but the foo dis made to order so you can't go wrong there. Had the Man vs Food plate & it was great!
The sole reason we went here was because of the man vs. food coverage of the fried chicken waffle. It is tucked in the middle of the casino, but you see it clearly marked on the escalator going up.. . The line was out the door even when it was only 11:30am. Wanting a quick brunch, we toiled around for 30min before been called. I was actually surprised that I did not see more people ordered the fried chicken waffle, but when ours arrived, people were asking to take pictures of our food. It was HUGE. Good thing we only ordered the fried chicken waffle between the two of us or we'd be lugging doggie bags with us for rest of the afternoon.. . Great place to take people who haven't been.
Huge portions for a good price! :) Ordered the chicken and waffles, as well as the salmon benedict. The food came pretty fast and the presentation was so pretty.. . Four girls shared two large orders and it was good to fill us all up :). . WIll be back to check out other items off their menu.
People reviewing this place are drunk.  The one thing that can be said is that the portions are big.  That's it.  Service  is terrible and is VERY slow.  The signature dish of chicken and waffles was TERRIBLE.  The chicken is so dry and bland that you literally have to drink water just to wash it down.  It was honestly one of the worst breakfasts that I have ever paid for.  Breakfast is one of the most difficult meals to screw up, but these guys managed to do it.
Previous reviewers are all correct on the portions, they are GIANT, too big.  Most people in Vegas are at a hotel and not taking home leftovers so alot of food is going to waste.  They could serve half portion sizes and charge slightly less and probably make more money without all the waste.. . That to say, the food, although excessive, was AWESOME!!!  I will definitely be going back to this joint.  I got the Farmhouse Scramble with bacon and avocado with the potato smashers and a side of gravy to eat with my biscuit.  Absolutely delicious.  Eggs were the right texture, not too soft but not overcooked, gravy was thick and good flavor, biscuit was perfect, potatoes were pretty much mashed potatoes so if you don't want those for breakfast, don't get them, but I loved them just fine.  Went great with my bowl of gravy :). . Boyfriend got the french toast and he was equally pleased with his meal.. . Only small complaint is there was an hour wait, not a big deal, we expected a wait, so we went down and played at a $5 blackjack table right next to the restaurant.  They told us to come check back in 30 minutes just in case and when we did were told to come back in 20 minutes.  We went back in 20 minutes and they said our table had been ready for 15 minutes.  They could invest in the buzzers to let people know when their table is ready so you can enjoy the casino while waiting without having to go back repeatedly and missing being called.  We were starving and would have been happy to eat 15 minutes earlier and would have lost less money waiting... . . Regardless, highly recommend!!!!
Great experience here with the food and service. Our group ordered the chicken and waffles and this pork dish. When they say the portions are huge it's an understatement. The food was tasty and the service was friendly. Really glad I was able to try it.
I have been to Hash House A Go Go twice this year and it has been a fairly good experience each time. I've tried the burgers, pot pie, chicken & waffles, and the chicken pasta. The food is good for the price and the portions are huge. The customer service is never a problem as well.
This place is awesome!!! Great food and drinks. Portions are massive and totally shareable . Try the sage fried chicken and wAffles ! Bloody Mary's are a popular drink here but I really enjoyed the strawberry lemonade margarita and the watermelon kiwi drink. You will have a wAit but it is a must for brunch or breakfast!
