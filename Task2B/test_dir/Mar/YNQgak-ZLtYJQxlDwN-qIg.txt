Many better buffets to be had at better prices. Staff at the buffet area very rude. Look at you and turn away. Clearly marked to ask for help if you have food allergies but staff said they didn't know anything and couldn't help. Won't be back.
We made it to Brunch and the line was ridiculous!! But I had already come to accept that Vegas was just code for lines everywhere. Anywho... . The food was good. I wish there was a little more of a selection in each cuisine, but I was spoiled by going to the Bacchanal a few days earlier..and this was also Brunch sooo maybe that's why. Their BBQ pork buns in the Asian section were so tasty!! I also tried some kind of beef, I don't know, the cook was hard to hear. But it was juicy and delicious!. . My bf and I were lucky enough to get seating out in the garden room area with all the pretty flowers. The service was pretty good. . . Overall, it was a nice brunch and we did stuff our faces. I wouldn't eat that candied apple though, unless you were looking to break some teeth! :P
The food quality was just okay. I had much higher expectations. Crab legs and shrimp are on ice so if you're looking for hot seafood go elsewhere. Beef was ok, sushi was very subpar. Like most of the food, desserts looked good but lacked flavor. Service was ok, although they cleared my table while getting dessert. I'm being generous with 3 Stars, more like 2.5.
I have a love hate relationship with this buffet...sometimes I come out feeling that was a good meal...other times I felt wow that could have been better. The last few times has been the latter. For one, I take the quality is just going down. I think compared to everywhere else, they do have the different choices with the exception of the pizza and the meats and breakfast, but that's just it. It used to be my go to buffet but it hasn't been for awhile.. . I don't know if it's just the Wynn but wth? The second to the last time I went my friend showed up with a muscle shirt and he wasn't let in because they have this no sleeveless shirt for guys policy in the buffet? Really it's freaking 100 degrees outside and you expect him to wear a shirt with sleeves? This isn't fine dining, it's a freaking buffet and it was 3 o'clock in the afternoon. What happens if we waited in line for an hour and then by time we get to the front you turned us away? that wouldn't have been nice at least it was quiet. But seriously, if you can come in into the hotel like that then you can go into the buffet like that..I can understand other restaurants but a buffet??? We didn't end up going back (the whole getting another shirt thing was just out of way) we ended up going to M Buffet. :P
I was recommended to try this Buffet over the Bellagio Buffet and I wasn't disappointed!  This buffet has a wide selection of different tasty cuisines and the best selection of desserts you can ask for...from gelato to creme brulee! I'm always satisfied with this place!
We couldn't get into the SW Steakhouse located in the same hotel (Wynn) for dinner, so unfortunately, we were all dressed up and no where to go.  We figured we would try The Buffet, and from the reviews, seemed like a pretty good place to eat. It was a fairly long walk through the casino and then what seemed like a really long lonely hallway to the restaurant. . . First tip, do not dress up to eat here...I was so overdressed, it made me feel a bit uncomfortable.  The quality of food (which is excellent) does not match the atmosphere of this very casual buffet.. . When you arrive, you're going to get a sense of tackiness...almost like you are eating in Cinderella's castle at Disney....But with all that being said, we had an excellent dining experience.  The food really is great here.  They had a very large selection, from fresh fish, steaks, salads, desserts, you name it, it was on the buffet.. . The buffet area is very big and spread out, so there were no lines to wait for food, or people shoving themselves into your plates to reach for something.  Excellent lay out.. . The night we were there, they were serving steamed Char Siu Bao in the Asian section, which is a steamed BBQ pork bun. I have eaten these in China towns across the country (NY and SF) included, and these were the best.  They also had a carving station  with massive bone in steaks and  prime rib.  They had amazing breads, vegetables, lasagna, pizzas, pastas, crab legs, lobster, shrimp, fruits, cheeses, caprese salads, ravioli's....the list goes on and on.  . . There wasn't one thing I tasted that I didn't like, and would have gone back for more, had I not been so full.  The dessert section is not huge, but then, who has room for dessert.  All the desserts such as the cakes and mousses were mini's.  They also served gelatto in a few flavors, which looked great, but I didn't have any that night.. . For the two of us, the bill came out to $100 which included tip and beverage. I thought that price was very reasonable for the amount of food offered.. . We would definitely make the effort to eat here again, when in Vegas.
Beautiful decor, great selection.  Oysters, crab legs and shrimp for seafood lovers and 3 carving stations for different meat.  For desserts, don't forget to check both sides of the station as there is a crepe station! We were there on a Friday, I don't know how much would be different to week days. There is a slight dress code in that men's shirts must have sleeves and women cannot wear clothing that is too revealing.
Great buffet!  You get lots of great food for your money!  Crab legs were great, as well as the poke!!  Yummy salads, excellent prime rib and quite the selection on cute decadent desserts.  Our server well... Didn't exist.  No refills on drinks.. Some one else cleared our plates etc.   We waited 20 min or so after dessert to pay for my husbands drink and tip him of course...but never saw him so we split (we had a show to see).  We watched as a long lined formed and tables just sitting with dishes and thought the line would move quicker if their servers/bussers did their jobs...  Just a thought.
My cousins was visiting from out of town. They really wanted too check out The Buffet since it had high rating and one of my cousins as much into yelp only wanted too try four too five stars establishment. I was down since never been here although thinking about my last buffet experience it was ok at best. I really came here with open mind but left with the same feeling that the whole experience was just ok. It had high points and low points with the food but really its buffet so hit or miss not uncommon. Maybe just over the years slowly became non fan of really any buffets would rather go for quality. . . Talk about different buffet line or maybe at the Wynn they did it on purpose too stand out from the rest. All the buffets especially ones on the strip the line is broken down into two lines with the same things and in the middle have the craving area. At The Buffet that threw me for loop thinking okay where does it start and end. I must admit depending on where you get sat makes you walk more too get your favorite spot of the buffet or just makes you want too load up extra save the trip come back. lol. Unfortunately were we got sat ended up opposite end of the crab legs, cocktail shrimp, oysters on half shell, and the sushi. Dam it. The crab legs was awesome. It nice moist, hot, and dip them in warm butter its heavenly. The oysters had couple different ones tried one not feeling it. The sushi was Terrible!! I know buffet sushi but really better off not putting any of that out. The rice was horrible, the nori was just as bad, and the fish question the freshness. The poke salad was miss too. Some of the craved items looked terrible dried out looking like the ribs, The chicken sausage was awesome. It was up and down recalling the whole line. The chicken pesto pasta and clam chowder that needs shout out! The dessert section was awesome never got around too trying the gelato. Love love the rice krispie pops that covered in white chocolate. I believe have three of them. I like the way all the desserts were displayed very elegant and even had fresh crepes. My cousin ordered on so we all shared and too be frank if they cooked the crepe more might have saved it. Bad. Three of us had one bite each like okay that enough of that one. Just like theme so many other good desserts from the creme brulee, raspberry cheesecake, tiramisu, and few more. I would still go back just make sure stay away form certain sections of the buffet. . . The service was good. Most part never had empty glasses and most part our dirty plates were gone by the time we go back from next round. . . U never think buffet be great place too people watch? If you sit near the front heavy traffic area. While we were there had group of bachelorette party up storm screaming saying hi too everyone. If know any dealers great spot you can wave too them on there breaks in and out.
Somethings were really good but there were a few things that were cold. Tad disappointed.
This is my all time favorite buffet in Las Vegas. My boyfriend and I have been coming here at least once a year for three years now. Every time we are in Vegas we make sure to hit this place up. All you can eat delicious prime rib and many other delicious meats! There's always a nice selection of various types of foods here and a lot of fresh desserts. . . The seating area here is so cute. I love how beautiful the inside of this buffet is. It is pricey but I definitely think it is worth the money! Just make sure to save your appetite for when you get here. I can't wait to come back (:
Great for people big on beef and pasta, not so great if you're more of a sushi and seafood fan. I liked Caesar's Palace's buffet better.
This was our first time there and we were impressed. The line to get in was a little funky and we were not sure we were in the right line for a few minutes. The price was reasonable and we recommend that if you drink alcohol you add the extra charge for the all you can drink option. It paid for itself after 1/12 glasses of wine.. The food options were endless. . . Don't bother going to the Wicked Spoon in the Cosmopolitan, or any other "fancy" buffet that Vegas has to offer. The buffet at the Wynn Hotel outshines the rest. It is hands down, the best buffet for breakfast/lunch in Vegas, and at $23 per person, it's a great value too.. . My gf and I went around 11:00am, just when they were making the changeover from breakfast to lunch, and it was absolutely delicious. The variety of foods was impressive. Everything from thin crust pizza, mussels marinara, chips and guacamole, flank steak, pancakes, pasta with pesto, you name it, they had it. There was also a bakery area with an ice cream bar which was a great way to polish off a fabulous meal.. . Not to mention, the Wynn Hotel itself is absolutely beautiful.
Loved the decor , loved the food, biggest strawberries I have ever seen!! one word.......WINNING!!!!!!!
I'm not a fan of the casino, but I just ate at the buffet, and it was pretty good.. My cousin and another couple joined us, and they also liked it.. We got there at 10:30AM, so we had the pleasure of eating breakfast and lunch, because lunch started at 11AM.. The price was on the inexpensive side ($21, which is low for a buffet on the Strip).. And, even though the line was long, it moved extraordinarily fast, which was good because I was hungry (big surprise, huh).. The only negative was that I bet my cousin that the flowers near the front of the buffet were real, and it turned out that they weren't.. I guess that I'm a stickler for details, but all the flowers at the Bellagio are real, and they're both Wynn hotels, so whatever. Hopefully, someone else will visit and bet me that the flowers are real, and I'll get my money back.
In designing The Buffet at The Wynn, Steve Wynn and his team have endeavored to convince us that we are classy people, dining in a classy establishment, and definitely not a bunch of gluttons shoveling calorie-rich platefuls of heterogenous cuisine into our faces. But, while the floral arrangements and pretty finishings typical of The Wynn are a nice touch, they shouldn't be fooling anyone. . . The Wynn Buffet is mainly about quantity. With 10-15 different food stations, running the gamut from Chinese congee to US comfort food, it definitely delivers on the core promise of any buffet. More importantly, though, The Wynn has managed to up the ante quality-wise, even if many of the individual dishes fail to perform when taken in isolation. The prime rib was good, as was maple-battered fried chicken, and the bakery is a sweet tooth's dream/diabetic's nightmare. We waited just over an hour for the Saturday brunch buffet. While fairly long, this seems to be pretty standard for Vegas buffets (and for popular brunch spots), and if you're particularly impatient you can pay an extra $15 to skip the line. . . On the downside, many of the individual items on offer aren't particularly tasty, and are basically an example of "quantity over quality." Spend your appetite wisely, and avoid average offerings like wood-fire pizza and the pancake & omelet stations. We also found the speed of service overly slow at times, as plates and utensils mounted up on the table before being cleared.
The Buffet at the Wynn is still my favorite buffet on the strip. While here to visit my brother, we decided to eat not only on the strip, but at a buffet since we wanted the full Vegas experience. Because we haven't already done that yet on our 53238th visit here.. So of course we came on a random weekday night where the wait was only about 30 minutes and the price was $34.99. What a steal!. First thing everyone flocks to--Alaskan King Crab Legs. Yum. Some were still frozen, yuck, but it gives me time to digest.  Cocktail shrimps were fresh and abundant. Prime Rib was bombbb. I probably had three servings.. . The dessert though, was kind of disappointing. They've had a better variety before. Maybe it was already getting late and they didn't put out any more? But I barely wanted anything they offered. Sad face.. . All in all though, I think they have the best variety of foods especially compared to the other buffet *ahem*wickedspoon*ahem*.
We really enjoyed dining at the Wynn buffet on our last trip to L.V.  Apparently, and I agree wholeheartedly, it's one of the better buffets in Vegas. The selection of food items is excellent; it will most certainly satisfy the picky eaters out there. In summary, and to avoid rambling, I highly recommend this buffet to food lovers from around the world. Line ups to pay and get seated can be busy depending on when you arrive....but still worth the wait. The price for this buffet also depends on what day you choose to dine; it will cost you more Benjamins if you dine during the weekend.  This buffet experience is 100% a must do if you're in Vegas. I can almost guarantee your palate will not be disappointed. My family and myself can't wait to return to this gold mine of a buffet.
It's really fancy. The tables, chairs, and the building is really fancy..  I'm a vegan and I was told they had a vegan section. Apparently I was misinformed and they actually have VEGETARIAN not vegan options. So I ended up eating a whole lot of salad and vegetables and such. There wasn't much variety with the vegetables so I had 2 or 3 plates of about the same stuff. . I actually later ran into the manager and complained about how there isn't any vegan options. She actually said that she could have a chef guide me through the buffet and show me the vegan options and I took her offer. . The chef was really nice, he lead me around the whole buffet telling me which foods I could and could not eat which was VERY helpful and kind of him. Too bad he took me around after I was around done eating.. Overall it was great! I just wish they had more vegan options and that they would at least label them. The service wasgreat. The overall picture of the buffet was great and it's a great place to go to (if ur not a super hungry vegan).
I'm not a huge fan of buffets so I'm a little biased. . . The buffet is average.  Service sucked, but that's to be expected.  You can't really judge a buffet by the service.  Price is high.  They also split us up because if you have a party of 7 or more they automatically add 18% for tip. We said it didn't matter and we could sit together, but they said they had no room for us and that it was really busy so they split us up anyways.  Oh well... It didn't really matter, but it wasn't that busy :)  I have been for dinner but this review is for both but mainly for lunch.  . . Food was average (at least it was edible) . Most of the meat was overcooked and dry (maybe I came at the wrong time). Ahi tuna seemed frozen, definitely not fresh or it was soaked in a weird cucumber sauce.. Seafood selection was minimal at lunch.. My mom had the sushi and thought it was dry... I didn't even go near it.. The chocolate ice cream had small pieces of ice in it, but it wasn't bad.  Just made it less creamy and a little crunchy.. The lemon and apple desserts were good.  Most of the others were not (too generic... very sweet, but no depth). I liked the Caulifower, but the brussel spouts were tough.  . Cheese selection was minimal but decent. .  . Note: I hate wasting food so I try to finish most of my plate. In a buffet, I'll take a small portion of what looks good and try it and go back if I like it.  I can't start with a huge plate and barely eat it... I've learned traveling its wrong to waste food.. . The only time this buffet is worth it is if you have picky eaters or starving crazy large appetite friends or family members.  The price for lunch is too much for what they service.  Dinner is more, but the food seems a little better... However, for the amount you pay, I'd rather be served a meal that they spend time cooking and amending if needed according to my taste.. . Honestly, everything looked better than it tasted.
It was awful. The food choices are limited for the price of $38 per person. The prime rib and rib eye were salty and undercooked. . . It was disappointing to dine at this buffet with high expectations. I guess I was expecting Wynn to deliver a fine-dining experience to match the elegant floral decor. . . Their Italian food was horrible without the authenticity of a fresh pasta dish. . . The Asian/sushi was generic with plain sushi.. . Most of their food selection was not hot and served fresh.
It's neck and neck with Bacchanal buffet. Both are the best buffets I've had in Vegas . The Buffet serves traditional American food with a twist and more. The decor is sooo pretty and whimsical and the service is always great!. . Came here for BREAKFAST on our last day in Vegas and it was amazing. $21 per person is a great price. Their food selection was very impressive for breakfast. So many different kinds of parfaits, egg dishes, pancake station, fresh fruits, cereal station, the best California rolls, variety of meats, and they serve crab legs and the most succulent shrimp cocktail for breakfast OMG! Everything we had was delicious.. . My favs.... -Shrimp cocktail. -lobster fritata. -California rolls (best I've ever had at any buffets). -smoked salmon. -banana and nutella parfait. -watermelon infused with tequila. -prime rib (amazing). -Thai chicken wings (wished i could eat more). . Their dessert selection was more of classic and traditional and not too creative and unique in my opinion compare to other buffets. But it's still delicious.. . I took off 1 star because of how the cashier area is set up. The people who already paid are crowded around the cashier area making it a bit difficult for the people waiting to pay to squeeze in. People behind us were complaining to staff. But other than that, I highly recommend this buffet!
Went for brunch earlier and I loveeddd it. Their was huge selection and for $35, I think it well worth it. The restaurant is arranged by ethnicity of the food (I.e. Italian, American, Asian) and they everything from crab legs and prime rib to sushi and various pastas. The dessert selection is just as expansive. Delicious!
Let me preface this by saying that I don't actually like buffets. But, the company I was with really wanted to check this place out and it did seem to be well-rated. So that said.... . Pretty nice spread of options for food. Things seemed cooked just fine. Beer was a bit overpriced, but so it is with nearly every place on-strip. The line was abysmal, despite showing up between major meals (breakfast and lunch), it was still nearly a 45 minute wait to get in. Once inside, a significant number of tables were completely empty, so I am not really sure what the hold-up was.. . I would probably return, but only if the line is smaller.
Extremely overrated! Look elsewhere. In shorts, this place just enjoys its soaring reputation and provides poor quality food. (Except dessert). . Quality?. Beef here is overrated. $9 beef from local market easily surpasses the steak here.. Thai fried chicken here is dreadful and dry.. Red snapper and salmon are dry and fishy.. Dessert is not bad.. . Worthiness?. Expect variety of seafood - Nah! Shellfish bar is full of bagels while chilled seafood bar contains only fruit salad. . Waiting time - horrible. Price wise - not worth it at all. Service - after the first glass of water, it was not filled.
This has to be the best buffet in Las Vegas!  My only regret was we weren't able to go to the dinner buffet.  If  you want to get the biggest variety of food to pick from, come here.  The atmosphere is beautiful, & the service was quick and friendly.  My daughter and I had the breakfast buffet.  Our server Mary asked if we had been before, we said no and she told us to take a walk around see all there was to pick from then take a plate and go for it!  It was great advice since there is SO much to choose from.  I tried to eat different things I wouldn't have at home for breakfast and things are served in small portions so you can taste and try new without having to take too much.  Everything was delicious and tasted freshly made.  You may have to wait in line for a bit but it's well worth the wait!  If you come to Vegas, this is a must!
So we pay the bill out front before we enter---2 buffets and 1 all you can drink mimosa/wine/beer (for me, of course) set us back $80. My husband is giving me that look like "you better be ready to make them feel our presence here!" Luckily, we skipped dinner the night before and were STARVING.  So we sit down and order our drinks and head to the buffet. I don't know what I was expecting, but this was my 1st Vegas buffet and WOWZAAAA! Sushi, shrimp, dim sum, rice, eggs, sausage, bacon, bagels, pastries, desserts, ice cream bar, pizza bar, omelet station, seafood station, salad bar, fruit bar, Mexican food....I mean Jesus H Christ! It was INSANE! I started with breakfast food and mimosas, but by round 3 I was drinking wine and eating sushi. I think we both went back about 5 times, and I had about 6-7 drinks. Needless to say we left feeling stuffed, ashamed, and I was drunk. We took a long nap afterwards! Only regret is leaving a 20% tip up front instead of leaving cash on the table where we know the server would get it! Can't wait to return!
