Hands down the best place in Vegas to get burger.  Without question, head to the Cosmopolitan and check it out.  . . PRO: . +Amazing burgers.  Try the "Gold Standard" burger (aged sirloin, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, garlic chive aioli) with a fried egg on top.. +Amazing bam-boozled shakes (with alcohol).  Try the "Drunken Money" (Reeses, Banana, Malt, Frangelico) or the "Red Velvet Cake Shake" (Zing red velvet vodka, red velvet cake, cream cheese mousse, mini whoopee pie). . +Beautiful waitresses.  The outfits are completely appropriate, but are reminiscent of Hooters.. +When you're table is ready they'll text you instead of forcing you to carry around a buzzer . . CON:. -Limited cooking options.  I tried to order my burger medium and I could only get medium well.  Ultimately, it didn't matter because the burger was delicious.. -The wait staff was hit or miss.  The first time i was there they came back frequently.  The second time, not so much.. -It can take forever to get a table.  I waited an hour on one Saturday afternoon.
3 stars for the great service.. . Food was pretty mediocre. We got the sliders and rising sun (?) burger and fries. The burgers were overcooked (we ordered medium and they came out well done) and the fries were soggy. . . The only thing that we really enjoyed was the black cow shake which tasted like a root beer float except with coke and cherry pop rocks. Brings you back to those good ol childhood days for sure!
This used to be one of my favorite places to go until I banned myself after making a complete ass out of myself hitting on the waitress here. I'll order to go next time. Good bang for your buck considering it's Vegas. Great people watching at this restaurant too.
SO SO SO good. Local or tourist, you need to come here at least once and try it out for yourself. If there's anything I could ever go for, it would be Holsteins. I hate that I have to partially drive on the strip to get here as a local, but it's so worth it to me every time. . . Buffalo Chicken Dip is a must try; looks funky, texture is different, but it's so delicious.. All of their shakes are TDF. . Also try their homemade ketchup!
Friends and I stopped in after lunch to grab some milkshakes. I was really craving a milkshake, and after eating at Jaleo in the Cosmopolitan, Holsteins was an easy choice! I have to have my drinks non-alcoholic these days, so I opted for a plain jane chocolate shake. I was expecting pedestrian and boring-they didn't really have any fun choices for non-alcoholic shakes, but my choco shake was anything but! It was creamy and decadent with gooey chocolate sauce on the bottom. The depth of flavor was surprising! . . Other friends had the frozen grasshopper, the campfire s'mores, and the vegan maple pecan shake. Everyone was very satisfied, and the table favorite seemed to be the campfire s'mores. Hands down.. . Even though we had just eaten lunch at Jaleo, we did order some fries and fried pickles to go with the shakes. Both were delicious, and after having lukewarm, squirmy fries at Gordon Ramsey PUB, these fries were a welcome change of pace!. . All in all, we had a great experience. We came looking for delicious shakes, and we were not disappointed. Next time, I will have to try a burger.
Wow, I don't remember the last time I spent $40 for a burger and a shake. That's right, because I never did! Granted this was Vegas, but it wasn't like I was at a buffet or anything.. . Though I was stuffed, and probably in a better way than if I had gone to a buffet, I left wondering how I ended up spending $40 (tax+tip included) on a burger and a shake. Oh yeah, it was an alcoholic shake. But why couldn't I taste the whiskey? Seriously, I'm not that much of a heavy drinker, either. That $13 Pumpkin Pie Shake, while heavenly delicious, did not have a single trace of alcohol in it.. . Like a studious Yelper, I did my homework and listened to Steph C.'s rec and opted for THE RISING SUN (Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado). I've never had fried avocado let alone on a burger! The crispy yam was also new for me, but man was that Kobe beef patty delicious. Medium rare perfection with that sweet and savory Terikayi Glaze. For those who don't know, Nori Furikake is a popular Japanese condiment which is like seaweed seasoning. It usually has sesame seeds, dried/ground fish, sugar, salt, and you guessed it, MSG. While I can't be sure Holstein's furikake had MSG, it definitely did not deter me from devouring that burger. It was not missing any flavor, and I couldn't be happier with the food in front of me. The fries were also delicious, but that burger was pretty unforgettable. It definitely doesn't come close to the best burger I've had, but props for making me want to return and try other menu items. Next time, it might have to be the BIG FAT GREEK (Greek Spiced Lamb With Feta Cream, Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion & Olive Relish, W/Tatziki Sauce) or the BILLIONAIRE BURGER (Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, Truffle Mayo). What can I say, I love a good burger.
Let me start by saying that our burgers were pretty good. As a party of 10 we got a wide variety of menu items and were pleased, if not impressed. The fries, however, were blech: mushy yet oddly over-cooked.. . A few things really soured our experience:. . 1. Total a-hole a the next table--can't be helped.. . 2. Our waitress was great (even after said a-hole PUNCHED her "accidentally" and didn't apologize!) The food runners, however, were a different story: They had no idea who ordered what (my pet peeve), and when one of the orders was wrong, suggested snarkilly that my friend should just eat that instead. Then made a rude comment as he threw down a salad and stomped off.. . 3. The bar servers are walking around in their underwear. Yay, you might say. Degrading to women, I might respond. While this is a "fun" restaurant, it was a bit much, and kinda out of place. Where were the male servers? Lawsuit much? Didn't Hooters have this problem?
Good:. - rising sun burger - the fried avocado in it and the sauce make the burger. This was my favorite part of the meal.. - the greener pastures salad . . Okay:. - lobster Mac and cheese - has a strong truffle oil taste, which I love but not worth the $16. Didn't have a lot of big chunks of lobster. . - steak cut fries: not bad, but nothing spectacular
Amazing burgers!!! Had the rising sun with an egg and it was to die for.. . Also had one of their alcoholic milk shakes, with pop rocks, was amazing as well. Planing on visiting again next time I head to to vegas.
Burgers burgers burgers!. . It ended up being a burger weekend for me in Vegas. After having my usual In-n-Out, Carl's Jr and Jacks, I decided I'd treat myself to a really good one. I didn't get to have dinner until 11pm and this was one of the few places in the hotel still open.. . Boy it didn't disappoint! I had the Steakhouse Burger and some hand cut fries. Decided to skip the milkshakes and have a beer instead. Brooklyn Pale Ale did the job.. . My coworker opted for the Classic and had no complaints.. . Service was fast and friendly. Besides, it was 11pm on a Monday night and the place was practically empty. Ask for Justin!. . Like most things in The Cosmopolitan, it's a bit on the pricier side. The bill for two can easily hit $50 and that's even before the booze. It's ok though because it was well worth it.. . Be warned though...the place is LOUD (Marquee nightclub is across the hall plus the restaurant had it's own DJ.) Probably not the best place to try to have a quiet conversation....
(Review is for milkshakes only) came here because I've heard a lot about the milkshakes, after looking at the menus in the bar/lounge area we noticed the shakes weren't listed on there, we had to grab the hostess (who was facing the dining room and talking to the other servers) and ask if we can see a full menu.  After agreeing we wanted to try some shakes we asked the hostess if we had to order in the dining room or if we could go to lounge area, she said we can sit at the bar, order to go or order at the bar.  We sat in the lounge area and noticed we had to go back to the hostess stand to get a full menu.  The hostess was still facing the restaraunt talking to the servers so I just went to her stand and grabbed the menu myself.  By this point I was a little irritated but still wanted a milkshake.  We ordered the Fat Boy and the Vegan Maple Pecan, it took a while for 2 shakes but after trying it, it was worth the wait.  A few minutes later a runner came out and brought the leftover vegan maple shake, we were confused since we had our entire order, when we looked in what we thought was the vegan shake, it was actually a vanilla shake.  So pretty much they delivered the extra/leftover vanilla shake to a vegan...who drank it not realizing it was non vegan. =(. I understand there's a chance of getting non-vegan items at a Restaraunt that's not completely vegan but the entire experience was not worth it.  Good shakes though.
not a fan of this place, now I know I was in the Cosmo Hotel but my $18.50 burger and fries was NOT one of the best burgers I've ever had.  I would go back to this place to people watch, then I would go down the street to Fatburger or In n Out for a good burger!
A very good burger! This place is an amazing stop in the cosmopolitain hotel. . . I got the golden standard, which is bacon cheeseburger. The twist being goat cheese, arugula and a tomato confit.  These additions take my favorite burger to a different level. . . The placed offered us a choice between table side and more informal "lounge" seating. Lounge seating is couch and chairs you pull up yourself. We had a table of 6 and This was definitely the quicker option. We had a genuinely a good time. A bit more difficult to eat at but unless you're using a knife and fork, it's pretty great spot to have a large group.  . . Kenya was our server and she was very good to us. Especially dealing with the many changes we had in our initial drink order. . . A fully stocked bar. We had a round of Vegas bombs (new to all of us) and several beers and jager bombs.  . . The burgers were amazing. Such a great combo. Everyone was happy with their choices. Mine was a complete burger. The goat cheese and bacon played really well with the burger. I was pleasantly surprised. Burger came with fries. Pretty standard fries, I think double fried.. . We had a good time, staff was very helpful. I'll definitely put this burger in my top 5 in Vegas.
Amazing natural beef burgers with gluten free buns. The fries are piled high and the specialty boozed up milkshakes are delicious. One of the best values in Vegas. Our waiter was really nice, service was timely. Highly recommend for lunch and a buzz.
So we decided to give this place a shot after hearing about all the hype! And it sure as hell stands up to it. . . Service was quite good and our waiter was very helpful with helping us choose the right dish that accommodates our palates (especially when considering the numerous number ofdifferent entrees and burgers here).. . Their Kobe beef patties are on point and super juicy (get it medium rare to medium done). The "Rising Sun" is their most popular burger. Just think about a burger with ingredients that are similar to a sushi roll! The lobster mac 'n cheese is damn good too! Made with real lobster meat and truffles, this is the ultimate gourmet style junk food that will make your mouth water!. . Grab yourself one of their x-rated milkshakes. When I say they are creepers, it ain't no lie! Don't let the sweetness fool you, they are infused with a good amount of goodness inside that you'll be surprised at how buzz you are within minutes!. . Expect to wait anywhere between 20 mins to an hour!. . P.S. - Check in on foursquare and you'll get a free beer on draft!
If I was the owner I would be wanting to fill the tables and sell food and drink.  I was here in Vegas 3 weeks ago and ate here. Burger was good but was irritated by hostesses. The should focus on seating people, tons of open tables. I went back yesterday and this time just was even worse. I would fire the girls. Pretty but totally not focused on customer experience. I will not be back, to many other good places.
If you are in the mood for a burger, this is the place. They serve not only traditional beef burgers, but a foodie approach to the burger concept with unique mixings. Pork belly, salmon, pulled pork, etc... Don't get me wrong, its a burger place, just not your usual burger place.. . I basically stole my daughter's Oreo milkshake and it was perfect. My wife enjoyed my son's root beer float as well. . . I judge places by the following: can't wait to go back (5 star), would go back without question (4 star), would give a second chance if there were no other options (3 star), wouldn't go back (2 star), would rather starve (1 star). This is a 4 star place.
Very good burgers and shakes.  My lamb burger was cooked just right and the cheese with it was fresh.  The shakes are really good and have good volume.  Nice surroundings, not too loud, comfortable decor.  I wish that they were open a little later as it would be a great late night place.
I had a burger called the Gold Standard. It did not have any gold contained within it and I am okay with that. It did not have very many standards, either. For example, a few minutes after it came to the table it started hitting on every guy there. Even Julian.. . No standards.. . I added a fried egg and I was happy about that. I ordered a caipirinha since they had a full bar and I was happy about that too. Kevin used up more ketchup than a family of six should use in any given month other than July. July is a month where most families of six use a lot of ketchup. Look it up.. . The art on the walls might make a vegetarian feel a little bad. But if you're a vegetarian and you're eating at this place, you're kind of an idiot. Not for eating at this place. But for being a vegetarian. What's up with that?. . Side note...the popcorn is pretty legit. Don't miss a chance to try it. It's free, too. So unless you just got sealants on your molars, you should dig in.
If you're thinking about ordering the tiny buns - don't do it! Just go for the full sized burgers instead, which are amazing. Came here first for a casual dinner & good beers, and came back the next day for some boozy milkshakes and buffalo chicken dip. The dip was great, and the shakes were fabulous! ! Love this unique take on traditional burgers and milkshakes.
I had a Birthday Cake Milkshake at Sugar Factory years ago and it was amazing.  Ever since they have not been great (supposedly they cannot get cupcake syrup or something anymore so they use vanilla), and I had felt deprived.  . . Once I found Holsteins, that was no longer an issue. Do yourself a favor next time in Las Vegas and go to this place and get the Birthday Cake Milkshake (has Vodka).  The price was similar to Sugar Factory (and this one has Vodka) and it was better.. . We have had food there that was great too, most notably the fried pickles.  . . Ever since going to Holsteins the first time, I have gone back on every trip to vegas (for the shake).  I imagine I will continue this ritual forever.
We had dinner with a group of friends at Holstein's last night. The Birthday Cake shake was amazing. It was an adult shake but it wasn't very strong. My husband and I split the Rising Sun burger and the Gold Standard. The Rising Sun was phenomenal...I absolutely loved the avocado tempura and the teriyaki sauce. The gold standard wasn't anything special...the award should have gone to the Rising Sun. I would absolutely recommend this place for burgers.
Mmmmmm. So good. . . They start you off with salt and vinegar popcorn. What. Right? Yum! I had the Rising Sun burger, I believe it was Kobe beef patty with deep fries avocado, teriyaki sauce, furikake maybe...don't quite remember. But it was yummy! They had a couple of others ones I wanted to try also but my belly couldn't handle all that food. I also had a dreamy cookies and cream milkshake (alcoholic) - portions for the shakes are pretty big. . . The art in this place is so cute too haha. Animated cows dressed as pigs doing random things. Would probably come back to try the beers and the pork belly buns. Yas.
Yeah.. Not that great for the price. Just another trendy burger place. It was better when they first opened.
The ambience of the restaurant was laid-back, the decor was modern and the seating area spacious. This is a good place for groups. They were easily willing to give us separate checks. . . The Rising Sun burger was definitely innovative and unique. The avocado was well fried and the medium-rare Kobe patty was cooked to perfection. The teriyaki glaze itself was too sweet for my liking. . . The Tiramisu bam-boozled shake was awesome. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, appropriate for a coffee lover like me, and strong enough so that I could taste the Patron xo cafe dark. I would definitely come here just to get the shake!
Great place for burgers! Was recommended this place by a friend who compared the quality of the burgers to Father's Office in LA. I haven't tried that place yet but this is definitely a solid joint. . . This place is pretty popular so expect a wait. We were seated after about 25 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. You can leave your number with them and they'll call you when your table is ready.. . The popcorn to start with is really good..honestly they were better than the fries that came with the burger. The fries were kind of bad, reminded me of cafeteria fries and were greasy and soggy, hence taking off one star. The burgers however were well worth the price, huge and delicious. I ordered a steakhouse and, being a gal who sprinkles tons of pepper on everything, enjoyed it very much, however it was definitely more cooked than the medium rare I had asked for. One of my friends got the rising sun which I think I'll try next time, I've never had any burger like it. Another friend got the machete and he said it was the first burger in his life that he couldn't finish, so that gives you an idea about the enormous portion sizes. ;). . Decor is nice, service was pretty slow but overall it was a good experience and I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas. :)
Really good bacon acacado burger and fries. I especially liked the variety of flavored ketchups.. . They had a jalapeno ketchup that was delicious! The menu had lots of options like different beefs or fries. . . Price was good and staff was friendly. Got seated right away.
What an awesome burger place, the decorations and atmosphere was great. I ordered the tiramisu shake and complimentary Cajun popcorn. I also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese which is one of the best I've had! I ordered the Captain Hook as well, I plan to return the next time I'm in Vegas and get a burger!
So my friend who has a great palate tells me we have to try this "burger joint" and picks it over Mastro's Steak House.  Really? Burgers over Steak?  So after about 30 minutes I realize he is not joking and I find myself and 3 other friends @ The Cosmo Holsteins location.  . . We were sat down right away ( I took this as a bad sign) and given menus that were covered in plastic.  Great, I turned down one of the best steak houses for this?  They have a full bar so we ordered Manhattans and Old Fashions.  The waitress was friendly and helpful enough, thanks Ashley.. . Okay so I do remember this place being mentioned on a TV show and the "Billionaire Burger with 100% Kobe Beef,  Foie Gras, and Truffle mayo" was ranted and raved about.  Fine.  I love Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, and am a Truffle man so I ordered it.  At $32 for a burger, this thing better be good.  Went for the Onion Rings for $2 more, $16.50 for the Lobster Mac and Cheese, $16 for Fried Pickles (not my choice), $16.50 for the Country fried Bacon, and my colleges ordered spiked shakes while I passed.. . Lobster Mac and Cheese was, well, watery and just so so.  One of my friends loved the stuff.  The fried pickles reminded me of deep fried zucchini but crispy and salty. Another one of my friends lectured me about pickles and how good they were.  Okay.  The Country Fried Bacon stole the show for the appetizers.  This was a thick slice of pork belly and was oh so good.  4 total pieces were gone in seconds.. . Now one friend ordered the Memphis Burger that had pulled pork on top of kobe beef and bbq sauce.  He was digging his burger.  Another guy had the Big Fat Greek which is Lamb and reminded him of the best gyro he's ever had.  The dude ordered lamb in a hamburger place.  Whatever.. . My other buddy and I ordered the Billionaire Burger.  Okay so mind you, this friend frequents 3 Star Michelin Restaurants and runs bills over $400 for dinner.  I also enjoy fine dining so when he mention this restaurant...Anyway.  This quite possibly was one of the best meals I've ever had.  Yes I know it's a burger, yes I realize half the food on the table were deep fried, and again yes I know we were drinking milk shakes (they were not me) with our meals but WOW!. . This Billionaire Burger was ridiculously stupid good.  It took me 25 minutes to finish it because I savored every bite, seriously.  I refused to drink anything so that the tastes can blend and linger in my mouth it was so good.  I couldn't believe I was eating a freaking hamburger that put a smile on my face so big my cheeks hurt.  I loved this burger so much I left a $20 tip.  . . Not for the faint of heart when it comes to $$$, granted we drank, one of us heavily (again not me) with hard drinks and tried 1/2 the menu but still a bit of sticker shock running up a $275 bill for 4 burgers, 10 mixed drinks, 2 shakes, and 3 appetizers.
This my second time here and it was just as good the second time around.  My daughter and son-in-law suggested this to me when they knew I was planning a trip to vegas months ago.  My best friend and I had lunch here.  She has a serious food allergy and they accommodated her needs perfectly!  As I was lucky to get the chance to come back to Vegas recently with my younger daughter, I brought her here.  Again we had lunch and the food was great not to mention the shakes!  They are heavenly!  I had the Oreo with Baileys Irish creme and she had tiramisu shake!   Both were great!  And huge!  Service was great we had to wait for a bit but well worth it!   Don't hesitate to try this place, you will enjoy it.
How can you not love this place? It's right next to Marquee, there's burgers, and of course... Alcoholic milk shakes! The menu is fit to your personal liking. It's difficult to give recommendations. While my bf got the standard burger, I ordered a chicken burger. The chicken was super juicy and flavorful. We ordered the Drunken Monkey, which is a peanut butter cups, banana, malt and alcohol (forgot which kind) milkshake. Service was on point and ambience was fun... Had a dj that night.
Read the yelp review and tried 2 famous dishes.. Hamburger was okay but it didnt surprised me..... great place in cosmopolitan, . good customer service. However, it was too cheesy and salty for me.
Such an awesome place!  Went here for my boyfriend's birthday. It's his favorite burger joint in Vegas. Shakes were delish, burgers were absolutely amazing, and the atmosphere was cool!
