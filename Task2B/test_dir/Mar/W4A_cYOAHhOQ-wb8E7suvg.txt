Amazing! Best show I've ever seen! Worth every penny, I highly recommend it.
Absolutely the best show I've seen. I don't know what else to say other than it was just absolutely amazing.
Together with O, my favorite shows of all time. I liked the plot as it was sue real. simply one word will do: breath taking
Book your tickets in advance. Great seats all around. This is one of my favorite shows on the Strip. The seats are comfortable too! I'm a local, I've seen many shows on the Strip and this is one of the best. People compare this to O but I don't. Everyone is a critic but the show opened in May 2005 so they must be doing something right. . They also offer a Backstage Tour which I recommend doing after you see the show. You will be amazed at what goes on behind the scenes and how much hard work and dedication goes into putting this show on.
Even though this show is not part of the Cirque du Soleil brand, it is done in the same style. Since they incorporate a lot of water elements it is actually really similar to O in my opinion. I think I enjoyed Le Reve a little more because there is more of a story but there were also some parts I did not enjoy such as the weird giant baby.. . The first time I saw it I was with my husband and we splurged for the VIP seats which was really nice. They were very private and you got your own space with chocolate covered strawberries and champagne so it was very romantic as well. The really cool part was that you also had a screen where you could see what was going on under the water. So, if a performer dove off a platform and disappeared underneath the stage you could see them down there getting air from scuba divers and preparing to climb or jump back up on cue. It was pretty cool. I'd definitely recommend that for someone who has already seen the show but wants a different perspective and a more behind the scenes (so to speak) experience. I saw the show another time with my sisters and I probably would only give it a four (O is better) but because of the VIP experience they offer I have to give it five stars!
Super amazing show and once again Cirque du soleil did not disappoint! Loved all the choreography including the magic! Still do not know how most of it was done, just amazing! Talented staff and loved all the water tricks. Sometimes I was seriously scared for some of the performers... They really put their life on the life for our pure entertainment! The Wynn theatre is just gorgeous and I'm glad we spent our night watching this show.
Phenomenal show!!!  This is why you go to vegas!!   I'm pretty sure my jaw was dropped the entire show!  Constant goosebumps, and gasps!!   The performers are unbelievably talented!  I don't think there is a bad seat in the house!  Oh and I found out the stage (which is water). Is 27ft deep!!   You see some incredible drops/flips/dives!!   Incredible!!
I loved the show! We sat in the 4th row in aisle seats next to one of the canals. The strength of the performers was incredible. My month was open in awe for the whole show. My only complaint was that I don't have enough eyes to see everything that was going on.
After watching ka and o, le reve was a bit boring for me.. . No story line much--can be sum up to about a girl who is a slut, tempted by desire for love or sex. . . Only cool part was the strong men stacked ontop of each other. Otherwise not worth the money. . . The ending stage set is prettier than o and ka... Take pictures.. . Cool part is u r allow to take pictures during the show.
Pretty good show, we were holding our breath at some scenes. Great seats all around so it's ok to get those cheap tickets since the stage is in the middle of the audience.
