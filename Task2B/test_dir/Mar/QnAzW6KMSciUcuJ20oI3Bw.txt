I do like this place, but I think it's received a lot of hype over being on the diners and drive-in show.  If you go on peak hours you're almost waiting 20-30 mins in line.  In most cases when I drive by the line is out the door 30 people deep.  The best thing on the menu for me is the ahi tuna burger.  Everything else is meh.
Went here on a whim, after hearing such positive reviews. The line to get in was ridiculously long and we waited about 30 minutes before we got to order, but the food came up really quickly after that. Downside: it's pretty pricey and the burger that I got (Southwest) was actually a little bland. But everyone else in my party got BBQ and said it was awesome. I tried their garlic fries too and they were really good - very garlicky but what else would you expect? All in all, I'd come here again but order something different. And be prepared to stand in that long line!
Really cool concept- they use local ingredients (some picked right outside of their front door). We went for breakfast and had the a) meat and potatoes and b) chicken and mushroom scrambles. These were BIG portions, so bring your appetite.
Excellent choices of salads and burgers with a twist. Also tender ribs and dogs and also pizza. Excellent sauces on everything and big portions. Casual indoor or outside garden/ lawn seating.
I love this place. The food, the location, the backstory of how it came to be. Fontina Burger!
Great atmosphere with the outside seating areas on picnic tables. It was a very relaxing dining experience. The onion rings were crunchy and great tasting. The sweet potato fries were also very good. Our party ordered pizza for the kids (ate every last bite), the Fontina Burger (very good pesto); the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, and the Grilled Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich. Nobody wanted to share so that means everything was good. I will plan on ordering the Grilled Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich to share among everyone next time. The seasonal Butter Pecan Shake was great also.
Don't go if you're in a rush! Great food but horribly long wait every time. I enjoy the outside seating and love that dogs are welcome at the picnic tables. They only make enough pizza dough for the day so get there early if you want to give it a try!
Imagine a farm, now image the stuff that grows in the farm being served to you as you sit overlooking the farm.  That's Joe's.  Excellent food, and they have a guy that walks around explaining food and the history.  Try not to talk to him, you'll end up buying half the menu, but he is very knowledgeable and his recommendations are spot on!  . . Oh be aware that the wait times are super long, we waited about 30 minutes just to order, than another 15 to get food. I took a walk through the farm at that point.. . Ahi-Tuna - Excellent tuna, cooked rare, just the right amount of sauce to give it taste without being overwhelming of the fish.. Fried Fish - served on that Friday, I think it's seasonal?  Very well cooked fish, good tartar sauce as well.. Strawberry Lemonade, there's lots of chunks of strawberry. It's perfectly sweetened and sour at the same time. . Fried Green Beans - pretty good, could have done without them though. Lamb Burger - it was the last day they were offering this, very well cooked mid-rare burger, great tazaki sp? sauce.  My favorite out of this and the Tuna.. Onion Rings - herb encrusted - I think it's a bit overpowering. Butter Pecan Shake - oooh man this was sooo goodd. One of the most amazing shakes I have had in my life.. . Tid Bit - If it's the day of your birthday you get $10 off!
Love this place, we went in during the breakfast/ lunch transition, a bit slow. The food was delicious, my favorite is the BBQ  chicken pizza! French fries are yummy too! Farm Burger is good, could use more seasoning.
This is one of my husband's favorite restaurants and we love that we can eat outdoors here.  The menu has a lot of great food and the quantities are large, so often my husband and I will split one thing and get either onion rings or the garlic fries.  We love their BBQ Chicken Pizza, too.  . . Any of their burgers and salads that we've tried are good.  So yummy.  And, they are always so friendly.  That is why there is often a long line to get into the place.  Even though, the line does move quickly.. . This is a great place for the family to eat and for dates with my husband with the kids.    The food is delicious.  The ribs are cooked differently than Joe's Real BBQ, but they are delicious nonetheless.  . . The atmosphere, surroundings of Joe's is also very comforting and peaceful.  We love Joe's Farm Grill.  And it's not too far from where we live either!
I love this spot. Such a great place to sit outside in some nice weather, surrounded by greenery and trees, which is a nice break from the desert landscape, and enjoy some AMAZING food.
This is one of our favorite lunch spots on a Sunday. We love to bring the kids and sit outside enjoying the weather. Everything on the menu is farm fresh and grown in the garden close to the grill! Highly recommend the chicken pesto burger and sweet potato fries, yum!
This is one of those local restaurants where you know you can bring out-of-towners to that is sure to impress!  The restaurant is built out of the owner Joe Johnston's 1960's childhood home (renovated of course!).  The bathrooms feature kitschy glass box displays of vintage Barbies and GI Joes.  It's a really cool space!  . . You order at the register, are given a vibrating pager, and can choose to sit inside or outside under the trees overlooking the Agritopia urban farming fields.  The vibe is super relaxed, patio dog friendly, and most of the vegetables are freshly picked from the aforementioned Agritopia fields -- as fresh and local as produce could possibly get!  The place has even been featured on the Food Network.. . Food-wise, everything here is good.  Great pizzas (I love the veggie one), burgers, (once again, I'm a fan of the veggie burger), fries (regular, garlic, and sweet potato -- yum!), salads, strawberry lemonade, date shakes...the list goes on.. . Side Note: Come here on your birthday and get $10 towards your meal (you can also do this at Joe's other 2 local restaurants -- Liberty Market and Joe's Real BBQ if you're up for the challenge!).
Location on the actual farm...now thats farm fresh.  Very casual, Very clean.  Food is the typical Dinner experience but its nice to know that Joe's farm grill makes the effort to use farm fresh products whenever possible.  . . My husband loved the pancakes.  You can tell the cakes are from scratch rather than a mix, plus, they are griddle fried,  not just cooked brown on both sides (if you know what I'm talking about then you know how much of a difference it makes) and they use real maple syrup without having to ask.. . you can also tell the eggs are higher quality than grocery store eggs...score.. . It will be interesting to come out and have dinner during a time of year when more farm produce is in season.  I look forward to harvest time!
Love this place! Can't wait to come back. The line gets crazy long. We arrived at 4:45 with no wait in line. By 5:00 the line was out the door! The portobello mushroom sandwich is delicious! The atmosphere is nice with lots of outdoor space to sit. Beautiful trees and surrounding farm. We will be back next time we come to the East valley.
This place is a must go when my family is in town. They have awesome burgers and some good barbecue selections.. . My favorite is the southwest burger with a side of onion rings. My boyfriend is a big fan of their date shakes.. . The style of the restaurant is that you stand in line to order, then find a table and wait with your buzzer for food. Then you go pick up your food when it is ready. So, it is a pretty casual atmosphere.. . They also offer breakfast that is apparently pretty good. I've never gone myself, but my visiting family members have and they have enjoyed it.
Excellent as always. I tried the onion rings this time and they were crazy good! The wedge salad is my all time favorite. I love the casual feel of the place and appreciate the freshness and elevation of the food.
I love this place! I brought my father here when he was in town visiting. He loved it so much that we came back again just a couple days later. He had the Thai Chicken Salad and the Grilled Salmon Platter. He loved both. I had the Farm Chicken Sandwich and Farm Burger with blue cheese. The sweet potato fries are a must. Great, relaxing atmosphere, able to sit outside overlooking community farming plots, organic and delicious food.
Hands down best burger joint I've been too. There's nothing I've tried that I didn't like. I LOVE 4B Burger and my wife usually gets the Fontina Burger with a gluten free bun and extra pesto. Don't miss out on choosing  from 4 different kinds of fries or grab their famous onion rings!
This place is good just not all that great. Hard to find parking and a very long wait for fast food quality items. Just because the restaurant is on a farm doesn't mean it is all organic or high quality. Mormon central thats for sure! so be prepared to be overwhelmed with large families and children running all over the place
Finally got to try this place. Living in ahwatukee it was never quite convenient since I was in Gilbert on a Friday at lunch I knew there'd be a line, and there was... so expect to wait at least 30 to 40 minutes before you actually get your food. Is it worth 30 or 40 minutes? yes!. Friendly, helpful service.. The BBQ Chicken Pizza was smoky, tangy and sweet--deelish!
The food was great, the atmosphere is fun and the people who work there are the best. . . They have awesome customer service. My wife ordered fish and when our order was ready they informed me that her meal was overcooked and it would take a little longer. We were happy to wait and I was impressed that they didn't serve us the overcooked fish. When her food was done, I picked it up and they gave me a gift card with the price of her dish on it. This was not the first time we've eaten there but it was the first time our order was not perfect and not only did they fix it, they paid for it. . . It was a great experience and the food is excellent.
love this place. I discovered it b/c it's next to cosmo  dog park. This place is an oases in the center of the desert if you like to get that country feeling with greenery, trees and chirping birds. The food is awesome. The burgers are amazing.  The weekends are crowded so if you can go during the week, it's much more relaxing. Wish i can live in this development called Agritopia which is attached to the farm. Lovely farm feeling. Love it!
This is one of my favorite places to go. their fried green beans are a must have. Also, if you want to try something really different, they have a Grilled Peanut Butter & Banana Split sandwhich that is pretty freaking amazing.  The burgers are super juicy and are automatically done as medium i believe. You have to request if you want it rarer or more done.. The workers have all been pretty amazing and the outside sitting area is pretty great. It can get VERY busy so be prepared for a possible wait. Especially on their fish fry fridays!! But definitely go and try them out!!
Love this place, one of our absolute favorites for breakfast or lunch! Fresh ingredients and great outdoor dining. We like taking our out of town visitors :)
