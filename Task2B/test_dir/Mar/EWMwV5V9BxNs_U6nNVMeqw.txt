Fez might very well be the best food in Central Phoenix. The staff is extremely friendly and the food and drinks are within budget.  Recommend as a good first date restaurant.  She'll appreciate your openness to diversity :)
Let me make this simple: Service was wonderful, ambiance was mellow & eclectic, and the food was amazing! ALL 5 times I've been there to dine! The drinks are delish too- love the lemon drop martini. I take people here to try all 3 kinds of fries & their sauces... But to be honest I doubt you could go wrong with anything onthe menu. One of my favorite places.
This place is awesome!  It's comfort food prepared with a fancy flair. I would give it a higher rating but the menu basically consists of sandwiches and salads. Do one thing and do it well. I love it!. #Fezburger #Goodeats
We love it , all bartenders are friendly n awesome people. I am here everyday with tara n the crew. Amazing veggie pasta.  If u see a big group sitting at the patio thats us having a great time!
FEZ is one of my favorite go-to places in Phoenix!!  I'm addicted to the Harisa Fries and the Strawberry Blueberry Cashew Salad is to die for...not to mention the always amazing martinis they serve :)  I've been a loyal client of FEZ for at least 6 years - probably longer.  Every person I bring to this joint is impressed...you can't go wrong here!
This place had great food.  Although it was busy, we didn't have to wait long for a table.
Rode in fora lunch on my bike pretty hungry for Greek food.. . The music there was a bit much for my migraine that day and almost wanted to leave but I needed sustenance so i sat there looking about the menu and decided to start with the Hummus (Hot)*. . Was a fan but I feel as if the chili powder they sprinkled it on top could have maybe been mixed into the batch of delicious Hummus itself?? was still delicious.. . I had gotten the Gyro Kisra and man it was.............. Rad. You just have to try it.. . Chicken curry plate my friend got was pretty bland. Did not compare really to the almost same exactly curry plate I had made at home the night before.. . Our server: was chewing food as he walked up to greet Us. Ew... Also did not give a hint of urgency when he has spilled water all over my side of the table. Our encounters with him were minimal and short. Kinda annoying since it seemed to be a quieter lunch as he had no other tables? Bad impression left for sure.. . I did though really like what I saw on the menu and even had a hard time making a decision on my entree so I will definitely be back! Different server hopefully.
I was really looking forward to trying this place out. Unfortunately, after being rudely greeted, sat and then ignored for 10 minutes I quickly lost my appetite. I then asked for the manager and very kindly explained to him what happened and he laughed and said sorry try us again sometime. That's it. . . I've never walked out of a restaurant before despite some really awful service because I've worked in the business before and I know that it can get hectic. Also, the employees are generally always apologetic for any mishaps. Well, not this place. I'm sure the food is fine but I'm giving this place a below average review (my first ever) because the service was that bad.
We chose Fez after picking a friend up from the airport late at night and were pleasantly surprised. Our servers were very friendly and helpful. The spinach and artichoke dip is highly recommended. My friend and I enjoyed
Great food, the atmosphere was a bit stiffy, but our waiter was really good.  Price are high, more.
I went to Fez for a happy hour.  I ordered the hummus appetizer, which was pretty good. Just kind of your standard hummus app.  I also got a the Fez salad with chicken, which was very good.  If you're looking for a good salad, check it out!. . Overall, I'd say it's a decent place. I'd go back, but I've been to better places.
Trendy and yummy, with decent service and nice flavors.  . . We've mostly been here for lunch on weekends.  The humus platter is enormous and the pita is just delightful - warm and soft and so tasty.  Try the veggie burger - it has won several contests over the years and rightly so.  The fries are yummy, and so are the salads - lots of nice, fresh ingredients.. . It's always been busy when we've visited, so our service has traditionally been a little slow, but always polite.  The atmosphere is nice - trendy but comfy decor, plenty of tables and a nice patio.  They're also open late, which is always a bonus.
This is our favorite burger place in central Phoenix.  . . First, their happy hour lasts until 6:30PM.  It's easy to leave work, pick up the kid, get to Fez and be able to have two beers at a leisurely pace before HH ends.. . The sweet potato fries are my son's favorite.. . For the burgers, our favorites are:  Fez Burger, Blue Cheese and Tangiers.. . Monday nights -- excellent Arroz con Pollo for $6.95.. . Tuesday nights -- specialty martinis are $4!!!. . Good service, good music and they usually have a cool 'pattern' playing on the east wall, which fascinates our 2 year old.. . Their patio is perfect in the evenings this time of year.
FEZ is great!  I love the atmosphere, and I love the Tangier Burger!  This would have received 5 stars however on a select few occasions the service was a tad slow but please do not let that stop you from coming in!
Fez works very hard at being hip. The aesthetics get it all right....the food is ok...the drinks are terrific...the staff is so friendly it's wonderful...but....it's full of Scottsdale matrons and their grandchildren .... take ALOT of friends, and dont' expect phenomenal food, and you'll enjoy it.
I love the food at Fez and try to go there every time I'm in downtown Phoenix. We usually go in a large group and they are always accommodating and have very friendly, attentive staff. The happy hour specials are great too!
FEZ is a neat little happening place buzzing with people at the bar! Love the interior and the ambiance. There is an option to dine in the patio if you are looking for quiet environment. The food was absolutely delicious!! If you are a meat lover and want to give FEZ a try, definitely try their lamb sliders!!!! ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT! So flavorful, juicy, just cooked right! Also their FEZ kisra is a different take on barbeque flavored pizza.... What can I say about the Service.... Serivce was one of the best I've had... Our server was Candice. What a lovely lady! Food was served quick and the experience was really good. Definitely have to go back for the lamb sliders and to try out some of the other awesome food that the chef cooks up!
Awesome.. great food ambiance and service..
Creative menu, nice ambiance and great location!
I always have a good time when I'm here. Drinks are great. Fun atmosphere. . . Chicken phyllo packets are my favorite. I'm not entirely sure what they are comprised of but they're delicious so whatever. Also, the sammies are yum. I got the pear pizza recently and that ruled. . . Try those items. I don't think you can go. Wrong with anything on the menu. I give it 4 stars though because the staff is super flirty and they're not straight and it makes me sad.
Great place for a night out with friends! The food was delicious. Had the vegetarian sandwich with fries. The place is in the middle of nowhere but definitely a great find!
Wow.  Absolutely the best sweet potato fries.  Went to Fez specifically for the fries.  I live in Redondo Beach, Calif but will be visiting Phx a lot more.......  Clifton, our server, was great.
We love Fez!!!!!! We're from Tucson and always stop here. We had both Saturday dinner and Sunday brunch. Great food and service.
Good food, good drinks, friendly staff, kinda pricey but worth an occasional splurge!
Wonderful food, drinks, service, and atmosphere.  I recommend this favorite of mine to everyone!
Love this place! fresh food, great drinks and very friendly staff!
Fast service. Good drinks. Friendly staff! Cool place to hang with new or old friends.
Frequent this place with my hubby for late night food, especially on Sundays for some reason.  I've had the kisra, the fez burger, the lettuce wraps, and a few of the salads.  The spicy harissa fries are amazing!!  The drinks are also pretty delicious and they have tons of drink specials!  I think this would also be a cool spot to go and lounge with some drinks and apps.
