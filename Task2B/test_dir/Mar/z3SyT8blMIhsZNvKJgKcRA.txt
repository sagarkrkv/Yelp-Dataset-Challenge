Aus dem Film Hangover ist das Caesars Palace mittlerweile weltbekannt und gilt als Insitution unter den Casinos/Hotels in Las Vegas. Zum Positiven: Die Lage direkt am Strip ist kaum zu schlagen und von auen und im Eingangshallenbereich macht das Hotel einen richtig guten, pomposen Eindruck. Auch der Poolbereich ist super, auch wenn man fur ein Bier hier 11 Dollar hinlegt.. . Was mich sehr enttauscht hat waren die Zimmer: die wirken sehr alt und fast schabig, diverse Mangel wie keine Luftung im Bad, Turschloss im Bad funktioniert nicht, keine Minibar, sehr teures Internet das man tageweise und pro Gerat dazubuchen muss sind nur ein paar der Dinge die ich richtig schlecht gefunden habe. . . Da es in Las Vegas so viele neue, billige und richtig gute Hotels gibt, fallt mir eigentlich kein Grund ein, im Caesars ein Zimmer zu buchen. Also lieber Geld furs Zimmer sparen und dann hier im Casino verzocken :)
So almost a year ago I contacted Caesars Entertainment, after giving up on their customer service responding to the issues I had, I told then to remove me from all systems, marketing lists etc. . . A couple weeks ago, after booking a trip at non-caesar properties I get a call offering me free night at a caesars property. Explained to the guy that I requested to NEVER be contact by them again. He apologized and continued to offer me 3 free nights. Told him I had no interest and that they would need to make me a crazy offer to continue setting foot on their property again. I also explained free nights meant nothing as I can stay anywhere I want for free whenever I want. He said he would talk to his boss.. . The next day I check my email and low and behold I have 7 days booked at Plant Hollywood. WTF...... . I've now made multiple attempts to contact the corporate office to get to the bottom of this and have had no replies.. . Stay away from the strip.. It's all about the shareholders now days, not you.
Gleich ein Tipp vorweg. Wenn ihr hier ein Zimmer bucht, vergewissert euch, dass ihr nicht im Roman Tower untergebracht seid. Es ist der alteste Teil des Gebaudes und das ist auch direkt sichtbar wenn man das Zimmer betritt!. Keine Minibar, Teppiche hatten schon bessere Tage erlebt, Zimmer sind ziemlich dunkel, der Ausblick nicht erwahnenswert. Alles in allem sehr enttauschend. Fur 200USD die Nacht bekommt man da wirklich deutlich bessere Unterkunfte!. . Dennoch zwei Sterne, denn das Caesars ist alles in alle sehr beeindruckend. Der Eingangsbereich sucht seinesgleichen. Einfach 100% edel, grozugig und legendar gestaltet. Nicht umsonst werden hier viele Filmszenen gedreht. Echt genial.. . Dann der Pool. Das ist wirklich eine gewisse Magie. Man fuhlt sich wohl wie im alten Rom. Der Pool war umwerfend. Nicht sehr tief, aber im Sommer fur Poolparty wohl genau richtig. Aber die anderen Gebaude direkt um den Pool schaffen eine besondere Atmosphare. Ein Bier kostet 11USD. Aber es macht einfach auch Spa dort am Pool zu liegen und ein Bierchen zu genieen. Warum? Es ist so wie das "sehen und gesehen werden" Ding was dort passiert. Extremunterhaltsam.. . Unser Zimmer hat eben den Unterschied gemacht. Denn Casino, Pool, und die gesamte Anlage waren einfach umwerfend. Aber wenn man eben dort ubernachten mochte, sollte das Zimmer auch den Anspruchen gerecht werden. Das hat eben nicht gepasst. Ansonsten ein Must See!
OK...I'm going to start off by saying this: Unless I make a specific comparison to another hotel, you can mentally add "but it's The Strip, and that's just how it is on The Strip" to any negative thing I may say here. Some things are just the way things are in Las Vegas hotels, you know?. . OK, that said, here we go! We usually stay at The Mirage in Vegas, but I got a super-good deal for Caesar's Palace this year and thought it would be fun to try another place on The Strip (and hey...who hasn't heard of Caesar's Palace, right?).. . To jump right to the good stuff: Our room was fantastic! We were in the Forum Tower, room 6215. The room was really big, with plenty of room for the king-sized bed (with mirrored headboard! Wowza!), a lounge-style sofa, an arm chair, a desk and chest of drawers, and a big flat-screen TV. Not much of a view, but then there's not much to look at from a hotel room in Vegas, so no worries there. The real "wow," though, was the bathroom! It consisted of a large "dressing room" area, with a washstand and huge mirror (with a TV built in!), a lighted closet big enough for both our suitcases, a separate toilet room, and a huge walk-in shower with TWO big "rain-style" shower heads and a bench to sit on...very posh!. . Now for just a few negatives: The room didn't come equipped with a fridge (the mini-bar was crammed full of items for sale, and the room information warned you about moving things in there to store your personal stuff...they are on a motion sensor, and if you move that $6 can of Diet Coke to store your own $0.50 carton of milk, they WILL charge you for that Coke. Refrigerators may be ordered from housekeeping, but be aware...there will almost certainly be a charge for that also). We decided to save the money and use the ice bucket -- Yay! Free ice! -- to store a carton of milk for our breakfast cereal.. . The room did have a nice Keurig coffee/tea maker, but guess what? Yes...there's a charge to use it. (Let's all say it together: It's The Strip, and that's just how it is on The Strip, so..."). . The TV had a good picture. The selection of free channels was adequate, but limited. Plenty of pay channels, though!  ("It's The Strip, and...").. . The resort fee (Added on to your room charge. But it's The Strip...) included internet connection for one device. Just one. We had two. But it's The Strip.... My husband needed to connect to work, so we ate the $14.99 charge for the second connection. On the upside, the wi-fi was fast and reliable! There were plenty of outlets too, which is a big plus for us.. . The bed was very comfortable (a wee bit on the firm side for my tastes, but still comfy), and the pillows were wonderful! (we looked for a label on them, in the hopes of being able to buy a few for our home, but the labels had been removed).. . The room also came equipped with ironing board, iron, hair dryer, etc. I didn't ask about charges for those, as we didn't need them. They're probably free, but if you need to use them, ask, because, after all, this is The Strip.... . The hotel itself is HUGE, and rather convoluted to navigate. Yes, I know, this is The Strip, and all roads lead either to the casino or to the shops (or both), but Caesar's seemed rather more difficult to navigate than The Mirage. That said, the people were absolutely WONDERFUL, and always willing to help with directions. The Forum Shops are worth a visit even if you're not staying here (the ceiling is gorgeous!), but they're pretty convoluted as well...we got lost there for an hour before asking for help after attending a show at another hotel.. . The only real negative about Caesar's Palace is the Bacchanal Buffet. It gets a lot of hype, which is why we decided to try it, but frankly, it's overpriced, and simply not worth it. I've written a separate review about it, but to sum things up: 1) it has nothing you can't get at any other buffet on The Strip, 2) it's about twice the price of any other buffet on The Strip (and, unlike the Cravings buffet at The Mirage, does NOT include beer and wine, 3) it is a total wasteland for vegetarians, and 4) neither smelled nor looked clean. If you decide to stay here, I highly recommend either trying one of the other restaurants in the complex or, if you want a buffet, going to The Mirage.. . All in all, not a bad experience (except for the food!). It is, after all, The Strip....
You have to stay here at least once in your life. I will definitely book here again and worth the money.
My boyfriend and I just returned from our trip to Vegas where we stayed at Caesars.  We wanted to stay here specifically because we had a great time at PURE and when we were walking through, we loved it. . . Flash forward to when we actually were staying there.  We got in super early, so we did was was called a 'pre-checkin'  which was awesome.  Basically it was taking care of all the paperwork without actually checking in.  Lisa was very helpful and very nice and basically one of the highlights of our precheck-in.  Once we successfully killed a few hours, we were still early but we wanted to check in.  When we approached the desk to get our keys, the woman working did not want to help us at all. Instead of being customer friendly, she almost refused us because we had 'refused to pay the early checkin' (which is not true..  Lisa did not pressure us at all and we were told we could come back we could check in at any time, and if it was early we had to pay a fee.).  I advsied Zandra that I never refused the fee and she proceeded to check us in with no additional conversation.  With Zandra, I was immediately disappointed.  Not a good start to the vacation. . . When we got up to the room, it was beautiful!  It was comfy and cozy and very well decorated (and there was a tub.. score!).  One complaint, there was no signage or anything that the snacks on top of the minifridge were on magnets that once you had it off for 30 seconds, it charged you (we found that one out when the wonderful bell man - i believe his name was Amir- told us when he brought up our bags). . . When we checked in, we got a coupon book for some deals within the hotel.  With each coupon, we ran into some stipulation that was never stated on the actual coupon (one was at Serendipity 3 and the other at the gift shop). . . Caesars is a nice place to stay, but watch out for cranky front desk agents and coupon books that have fine print not even written anywhere you can see.  Most likely, we will not be returning to stay again.
Like: Indoor has a shopping mall you can walk and pass some time in Vegas. GREAT sales at H&M when we went! Buffet has TONS of options for food it was like the wall of food never ended. Especially if you like seafood. Oysters were a hit by people and constantly needed refilling. . . Dislike: The buffet was SUPER cold the AC was blasting. Expensive too, but it's Vegas at a strip hotel so that's expected. Some of the buffet food seemed to be sitting out for a long time, but that happens often with large buffets like that. Line to get in was LONG like waiting in a zig zag line for an amusement park ride.
This hotel is very very very pricey & expensive! I say this because all of the stores are too darn expensive and pricey. Gucci, LV & etc.. if you do not have money then don't come here Lol but it's a nice place to walk around and eye candy it up! I love walking outside of the hotel because there are so many places to pass by and the escalators are unique as well.. meaning you just don't go straight down or up but in circles! preeety fun 8)
Like ancient Rome, Caesars Palace is old, but still impressive.. . Caesars has done a decent job of upgrading rooms, restaurants, and entertainment in an effort to keep up with best of Vegas. Sure, for similar prices you can usually find a 5-star Las Vegas room, but staying at Caesars in the middle of the strip does have benefits.. . The hotel has a wide range of rooms to fit just about any budget including classic rooms, tower rooms, fancy "Nobu" rooms, multi-room suites, spa suites, exclusive "Laurel" rooms, and, of course, Forum Tower Emperors Suites for bachelor parties made famous in Hangover. In room amenities vary depending on the class of the accommodations. Don't forget about the mandatory $28 Resort Fee per day when booking your stay, too.. . Headliner acts often do short stints at Caesars so if you are a fan of Celine Dion, Jerry Seinfeld, Elton John, Shania Twain, Jeff Dunham, Rod Stewart, or one of the other star acts then purchase tickets online early.Absinthe is an adults-only show five nights a week that blends a cabaret vibe and raunchy humor with acrobatic skills.. . Even if you don't stay at Caesars Palace, the dining and shopping options are worth a visit. The Forum Shops is a huge indoor mall of stores and restaurants under a blue sky. It's an experience to see at least once and take in the architecture, statues, and animatronic performance at the large fountain. . . For eating at Caesars, Bacchanal is the current "it" buffet with lines and prices that will make you wonder if "it" is really worth it. There are dozens of other options including chains like The Palm, Spago, Joe's Seafood, Cheesecake Factory, and such. Other name restaurants to consider are Guy Savoy, Nobu, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, and Gordon Ramsey's Pub.. . Obviously, Caesars Palace is much more than a casino. The gaming areas are relatively clean and smoke-free. Slot machines seem everywhere or sit down to play poker or blackjack for awhile.. . Self-parking is free in the structure behind Caesars while valet is convenient (except when they are busy). Because Caesars Palace is in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, it is convenient to the Bellagio, Paris, Cosmopolitan, Mirage, Treasure Island, and the Venetian.. . Caesars Palace has remained remarkably relevant for over 50 years. Even though it isn't among the elite hotel resorts in Vegas, the "Spartacus meets Rodeo Drive" vibe is well maintained with plenty of attractions, restaurants, and shops to attract visitors and guests.
I so wanted this to be a good experience... But it wasn't.. We arrived at Caesars and were placed in the Forum tower in a non-smoking room which was very run down for how much we'd paid for it. There were scratches and marks all over the TV cabinet, the room was very dark and we had a view of the back car park. Unfortunately I fell ill on the second day of our stay so had to call a Doctor to the room. The receptionist promised to call the company to send one out ASAP, we waiting three hours with no word so called back... She hadn't called the Doctor because she'd misunderstood something I'd said.. We also had a guest moved in next door to us who was a chain smoker, filling our room with the foul aroma of fresh cigarette smoke. When we complained the hotel offered to switch our rooms which, although worked out well in the end, seemed really ridiculous considering we'd been in our apartment for two nights already and they were aware that I was deathly ill.. . On saying that, when we did get moved (to the Augusta Tower) we were given an entire non-smoking floor and an absolutely breathtaking room... why we weren't given this to begin with, I don't know, as we were informed it was slightly less than the one we paid for.. . The ambience on the Casino floor and helpfulness of the staff was top notch. The restaurants second to none and the overall out of hotel experience was wonderful.. Come party and gamble here, DON'T stay here.
Do Not stay at Caesars Palace when the Cinemacon event is going on.   We stayed there during the event and our room was shaby, and the service staff  was really slow.   The room they gave us,  the bathroom sink was plugged up, the faucet was dripping which was a minor problem, and the toilet handle was broken. I complaint to the manager at 10am and the problem wasn't fix until 5pm, plus there were no available rooms to change nor upgrade.  Avoid staying at Caesars Palace during the Cinemacon event, go stay other beautiful hotels near by.
I would just hope that my room and blankets would be cleaned BEFORE I check into our room. So disappointed to take the purple blanket off the bed to find "leftovers" from the last couple stay!
Caesars, what's with the constant checking of our IDs? I understand we're not dressed in either cheap clubbing outfits from Old Navy or Forever 21, or that we weren't drunken morons just dropping money carelessly. I understand that we're just gamblers trying to play a card game without having every new dealer ask us for IDs. I understand that we were just dressed in a shirt and jeans. And I do understand that we're all well into our 30s and into his 40s and haven't been carded in a while.. . Maybe it was our small stack that made you ask questions. But you see, at a $5 table, a stack of $200 should be acceptable. The stack of $5000 by the whale next to us is better suited for a higher limit table. But I know that's why you paid more attention to him and wanted him to win and showed us no care at all.. . This same story followed me and my friends to Bally's; another Harrah's property. Just bad taste. The Harrah's properties have all been going downhill, and now crappy customer treatment seems to be their norm. I'll stay away and give my business to MGM properties instead. Stay classy Harrah's.
