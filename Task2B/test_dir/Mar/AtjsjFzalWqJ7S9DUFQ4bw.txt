I appreciated that the Senior Guest Services Manager reached out to me after I posted a review on my recent stay at the cosmopolitan. She listened and definitely took notes. She even took the time to write an email to apologize for the bad experiences I had during the recent trip and ensure this is communicated to the staff that attended to me. Clearly shows that the cosmopolitan takes their customers' feedback seriously and shows sincerity in redeeming confidence from their customers.. I'm very impressed with how they handled my feedback and also how they tracked down my phone number considering my yelp account is not linked to the cell phone and email account used when checking into the hotel. This shows that the hotel is serious about making their hotel successful and known for impeccable service. With that said, I will give the cosmopolitan another try the next time I'm in Vegas. Great job Guest Services!!
Awesome hotel to stay at, but HORRIBLEEEE customer service.
This was our second time getting an Invited Guest email for two comped nights for a terrace room, and we used it for the two nights leading up to our wedding on Valentines Day.  . . We had a short wait at check in and were welcomed by Natalia, an incredibly friendly young lady who upon collecting our information exclaimed, "You're getting married?!  Congratulations!"  At first it confused me, but then I remembered I wrote it in the comments section on my. reservation- proof that they DO see that section!  She hit a bunch of buttons and with a huge grin says, "I got you a suite!". . She nabbed us a wraparound suite with two bathrooms, a kitchen and dining area, a livingroom and 60 feet of terrace that spanned around the corner of the building.  The free upgrade was an incredibly appreciated gesture and made my last sleep as a single woman very memorable.  I got the suite with my bridesmaids the night before the wedding.  :). . The newly renovated Bond lounge is on point, the Liberace exhibit is great, and Secret Pizza was as good as it always is at 2am!  See you again soon, Cosmopolitan!
What's not to love about the Cosmo?  The service is great, the rooms are chic.  You feel like a baller the moment you walk through the doors.  The Cosmo is the place to go if you wanna see and/or be seen.  If you want to keep it casual, then the Cosmo is not the place.  Tons of restaurants and lots of shopping close by.  Right next to a 24-hour Walgreens for all your basic needs.  The Marquee nightclub is the place to go if you want to do the club scene.  If you stay at the hotel, you get automatically put on the guest list, which is a shorter line, but it's still a $20 cover.   Secret Pizza on the 3rd floor is also the business.  Talk about yum.  No, seriously, talk about it!!. . The Cosmo is definitely my favorite place to stay in Vegas, when I can afford it!!  Do yourself a favor and splurge when you can.
This past October was our second trip to The Cosmo & my husband is a Platinum Elite member. Last time we came, we received an upgrade to a very large suite but this time we were told it would cost $150 extra a night if we wanted the upgrade this time. This didn't make sense to me because the room was obviously available and they didn't charge us last time we requested an upgrade. Apparently they don't offer this perk for Platinum Elite anymore, but oh well. VIP Check-in is worth it so you don't have to wait in long lines. We received a room with a good fountain view, though smaller than I'd hoped for. Terrace Suite was good, clean, and comfortable. They do still offer the Wicked Spoon brunch buffet for two for Platinum, but the drinks are no longer included as they once were. Still, $10 dollar bottomless mimosas or bloody mary's...not too bad!. . For the gamblers: The dealers here are very friendly - as the security guards are too. I can't tell you how many times I got carded and they asked in an INCREDIBLY polite way. My ID was never demanded, always asked politely if they could please see it. I shouldn't complain for getting carded, but when you hear it 15 times in an hour, you want to hear somebody be polite about it.. . The Bad:. . -This entire casino smells like sewage. Am I the only person who thinks this? I'm not sure if it's a combo of the perfumes and central air scent or what, but it's weird.. . -Service has depleted a bit since our last visit a year ago.. . Honestly, I'll keep coming back here since we don't have to pay anything, but had we paid, i would have expected higher service levels than we received this time.
Dear COSMO:. . Your valet guys are freaking awesome! They deserve a bonus, Never had better service than the Cosmo when it comes to that. Extremely fast and friendly. Really enthusiastic about their jobs and it shows. They were the only ones that kept wishing me a happy birthday ;). . Casino staff is better than most resorts too IMO. Stayed up late gambling and had a really really nice time with the dealers. Usually late at night you will get the poker face dealers that do not want to interact with you but this time was amazing. Really enthusiastic and positive dealers that kept me at the table gambling longer than I wanted to stay. That was awesome! hehe :P. . Housekeeping was fantastic. I mentioned that you get what you pay for. So don't even dare to complaint about house keeping if you don't TIP. You get what you pay for.. Leave a good tip ( 5 - 10 ) for the house keeping and your room will be shining upon your return. . NOW time to be a little bitch and complaint :). . When you check in on your birthday you kind of expect to get hooked up because this is Vegas and you are a loyal customer and you stay at this hotel about 4 - 6 times a year because you are a proud Identity Member and you don't want no Gracie  or Mlife cards in your wallet....You support them hence they should support you....right?. . Apparently NOT @ the Cosmo....! No happy birthday to me! There is nothing we can do for you I was told. I had to pay for a room upgrade which was kind of weird because I always tip the front desk and they always hook it up with either a view or move me to a better room. But not on my Birthday LOL. On your Birthday you pay more!! LOL. O_o. You get one day out of the whole year to secure me as a customer for life and you do this?!?!?!. . ( Especially after reading all of the other reviewers that got upgraded for pretty much any occasion there is.). . Sad, sad, sad to see that loyalty means nothing to this hotel...:E - 2 Stars from my previous review :(. . And they just upgraded my membership status too...LOL. . Aaaaand ( drum roll )  the cherry on the top:. . -1 for all the stained  pillows on the balcony. . . Sad, sad, sad really wish I could keep the 5 stars going...:F~ . . I would really love to see some feedback.... . Coming back June 3rd. Lets see if the rating goes down or up :-)
Why do I do this to myself...I stayed at the Cosmo only once and that's like a month or two when it first opened. My mom still has the 30% of for that next stay but they jacked up the price now...I got it for like $150 with $50 resort credit so I spent it on Wicked Spoon downstairs. . . The rooms were spacious. It's like it could have been a studio or something with a kitchen! There was like big empty space that I could probably fit another bed in and we had double beds!!! They said that it was a condo turned into a hotel when the housing market declined so makes sense but all that space..put something in it.. . The only reason why I can't give this a 5 star is because the reason why my mom got the 30% off for next stay. When we were checking out. It took about 30-45 minutes just to get downstairs from our level. I would have walked down but that was like 20 flights of stairs. We were going to check out at 11 but ended up checking out at 12 because everyone and their mama's were checking out. It felt like they had 2 elevators working and it all was full. We tried going up and then down but people had the same freaking idea. And the line to check out was full as well. The moral of the story is to check out on the TV and leave when not everybody else is leaving. I'm sure they probably have figured it out by now, but I just had to give my two cents.
We stayed in the 2 bedroom city suite last year. It was a spacious suite with luxurious amenities and a spectacular city view. I love the chic and glamorous crystal chandelier decor everywhere around the casino and bars!. . We received VIP service at Marquee, which I recommend everyone checking out at least once. When you stay here, definitely take advantage since you can move right to the front of the line and with no cover charge.. . Their spa was nice as well, check it out if you have the time to unwind. Overall, our stay was great and we would recommend it to others, but we are going to continue trying new hotels on the strip before we repeat our stay here!
The funnest hotel ever!. . Ahh what can I say about Cosmo that haven't been said? Cosmo is stunning with more stunning places inside. . . Amazing rooms-check!. Chandelier bar- check!. Best day club ever @ Marquee day club??- check check check!!. . I've stayed here several times in the past few years for bachelorettes and girls trips. We had the best penthouse rooms. Everything is so pretty and when you are on girls trips, esthetic is pretty important. It also helps when the temperature is 100 degrees plus outside. Restaurants are a ok though but you are in Vegas. Go across the street to Aria or next door to Bellagio for food. But for the pretty rooms and young crowds, you just have to be here. Not to mention the best pool parties!! Fun all around.
THE BEST PLACE TO STAY SO FAR FOR ME!!! . . Loving the Balcony and the strip view! The staff was friendly and the room was so spacious!! OMG it was amazing. I practically  lived better than a person in San Francisco living in a studio!. . HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
The Cosmopolitan houses some of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. Hands down. It is perfectly centrally located, and you can get almost anywhere with ease. The aesthetic is ultra glam chic, and there are oodles of chandeliers dripping with crystals everywhere you look. . . Jaleo, China Poblano, and e' are some of my absolute favorite restaurants. Can you tell I am obsessed with Jose' Andres? You can wander around the shops, grab a salt air margarita from China Poblano to go, and get lost in all the passageways. It's truly a fantastic experience!
I've been spoiled. Damn this place is definitely for a celeb like myself lol. The Moment I stepped in this joint, I fell in love. Room was on the 39th floor. View was beautiful from the patio and the tub. Dined at Holsteins. Had a palette salivating burger. That meat between  those buns was Hella good! The Price is Right slots were good to me baby. The drinks they give you while playing, are coming to you in a nice size glass honey. Thank you. I can't stand when I usually get a shot of Cabernet instead of a glass. I got a glass :-) . Didn't wanna leave but had to. Came back home for one day and went back to vegas. Guess where I started again, you Damn right. The Cosmopolitan
This is our first stay at the Cosmopolitan and we love it. The staff is terrific and they provide service that comes across as very personal. The view from our room overlooking the Bellagio fountain and the strip is fabulous and we love the balcony. This is just our second day, but so far we are definitely planning future stays here.
By far one of my favorite hotels in Vegas. Young, edgy crowd with lots to do. Amazing restaurant selection (China Poblano's Chinese-Mex fusion is a must!), great clubs (Marquee!), and fabulous decor. Every corner has something cool to look at, like the repurposed cigarette vending machines that now dispense local artwork on the 2nd floor, interesting sculptures, and vintage black and white photos of parties past. Lastly, don't forget to check out Rose. Rabbit. Lie. with craft cocktails, dancing, several hidden rooms to explore, and cool performances (e.g., dances, raunchy comedy, trapeze) interspersed throughout the night. Also, many rooms in the hotel (if you're staying) overlook the Bellagio fountains and the patio gives you one of the best views of the Strip. This place is pricey, but well worth the experience in my opinion. Renewed my faith in Vegas and the Strip :-) Enjoy!
Everything about this hotel is awesome!!!!  The food, the hidden pizza place at night, the service, the view from our room, people watching, and best of all the location.  I will definitely be back!!!!!  I didnt want to leave.
Wow, this is a gorgeous hotel and the best place I've stayed at in Vegas.  The rooms are very spacious and comfortable.  Shoot,  the shower could be a room in itself!  You could fit ten people in there and I'm sure people do!  This is Vegas afterall. The view from our room was amazing.  You could see all of the strip. We watched the water show at the Bellagio from the comforts of our balcony.  The only thing that frustrated me was everything from lighting to room temperature was remote controlled.  Maybe I'm just technologically inept.. . The restaurants in the hotel are excellent as well.  I won't go into details on those because they are a whole separate review but the burgers at Holsteins are a must do if you enjoy a good burger.  And although Blue Ribbon Sushi is mostly Asain cuisine,  the fried chicken and waffles is finger lickin good!
We stayed at the cosmopolitan 2/26/14. Upon checking in I realized there had been a miscommunication on part of the hotel. No big deal but after bringing this to her attention, Wendy our front desk agent seemed to careless. She then tried rushing me along when I inquired about the hotel fees. So this was our first impression. Later other hotel staff we encountered throughout the casino, restaurants, stores, and shuttle were much more pleasant. The hotel has a great ambiance and is beautifully decorated even down to the sexy see-through showers...very clean and well ventilated as well (non-smokers really do appreciate). After arriving in our room we found our tv didn't work and had to wait a while for repairs (over 1hr) as well as with the safe the next morning. Again not a big deal but time costly. Lastly there was an extra charge for incidentals which I had to dispute. No problem except the customer service rep seemed a little hesitant to refund and assured me they would have to investigate with service staff before refunding. It wasn't until I sort of explained our overall experience that she refunded me. Which honestly by this time was pretty off-putting after all of the other little mishaps. We had a great experience because we made the best of our time. We made it a great time. Not sure if I would book again though.
A lot of stores, bars and restaurant options. Cool interior, well-appointed rooms, exquisite tubs and showers and location on the strip. However, although I understand pricing in Vegas, I disagree alcoholic drinks should cost $18. Not for me.
Fantastic location on the Strip. Wonderful staff. Got an upgrade on arrival. Amazing rooms with great views. Cannot wait to get back to Vegas!
Recently in town for three days attending a work convention also inside the Cosmo.  I was blown away from the room as I walked in.  Large living area/office with small half kitchen (fridge, microwave, and wet bar).  Toward the back was a closed off room for the bedroom and onto the large balcony complete with balcony furniture.  The bathroom was a huge highlight, easier larger than the bedroom itself.  Large walk-in shower than continued into a jacuzzi tub with a huge window overlooking Las Vegas.  Don't worry the glass has a mirror coating, you can enjoy that shower/bath without closing the blinds, at least I did!  Separate room for the toilet.. . There are big flat screen TVs in both the living area and bedroom.  The office desk had tons of power and connectivity options including HDMI for the office TV which was nice.. . For me the true test is the bed and pillows.  I'm extremely picking as back home I've spend thousands on quality bedding.  I must say the mattress was very comfortable and the pillows were to my liking.  I got a great sleep with no back issues the following morning.. . Overall I was extremely impressed and will be staying at the Cosmo again!
This hotel was amazing. By far the best hotel I have stayed in in Vegas. The decor is phenomenal, the customer service was excellent, the housekeeper did an amazing job. Our suite overlooked the Bellagio and Paris, making for a phenomenal view. The hotel is also in an excellent location on the strip. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Vegas!
"So what are we going to do? Sit around bars, sipping Cosmos and sleeping with strangers when we're eighty?" -- Sex and the City (TV Series). . So for this, I'm reviewing the casino and not the hotel accommodations since I didn't stay here. . . Not too bad, but not my favorite on the strip. It seems so upscale when you walk in (upstairs from the strip and you come down an escalator to the casino). The ceiling is draped in jewels and the place is decorated in vintage photos and giant shoes that you can climb into and have someone snap a pic of you.  Once you hit the casino though, it seems dark and sort of cramped.. . I will say, the coolest feature is these old time cigarette machines everywhere.  However, they are stocked with cigarette sized boxes with limited edition art pieces. Random pieces made by artists I've never heard of, but so very creative to retask old machines into something new.. . The machines were all slots everywhere. They did have an Organic Roulette machine, but the drink gals were slow and seemed less than happy to serve the 8 people playing on it. Very disappointing. After some time we decided that there were better casinos and off we went / plus the drinks were stronger elsewhere.. . The bathrooms were huge, and spotless. Always a plus.
Nice price but a bit expensive.  Room was great with good view of fountains. The staff was friendly and helpful
I love this hotel, normally stay here when I am in Las Vegas, great location, great views of the strip, the location is very central and easy to walk to anything.
I'm a regular here. A Cosmo-holic if you will. Ten trips in a single year, and many more to come I'm sure.. . From the moment you're dropped off into the lobby, you know that you're in for a real treat. People like Kristin, who works at the front desk, simply incredible. Accommodating, polite, and beautiful. She has helped me to get into my preferred tower, and will go above and beyond to make sure that your stay is perfect.. . The rooms are nothing short of spectacular. Private balconies on the Las Vegas strip, who knew? Literally worth every penny. Fully stocked refrigerators, full kitchens, big bedrooms, and heavenly beds oh my! But nothing, nothing compares to those wraparound suites. Something like 400sqft of your own private Lanai. Nothing compares.. . Having never used the Cosmo for business purposes, my trips on the elevator almost always end at either the first or second floor--for gambling, or for Wicked Spoon. The Wall Street Journal did a bit on how Wicked Spoon, a Las Vegas buffet, could be "the best restaurant in America." Good god, it actually might be, this place is unreal. Perfect service, perfect chefs, perfect meals, perfect ambience. The TV screens on the walls display information ranging from the definition of gnocchi to the pranks the chefs play on newcomers to the back of the house. Very fun, very good, very Cosmo.. . By the time you get back downstairs to gamble, you should already be on cloud 9. But then you meet people like Maria, the blackjack dealer who works the morning shift late in the week, and your experience gets that much sweeter. Kind, thoughtful, and appreciative. Happy to have players at her table, and even happier to make sure that they're taken care of should they need anything. I took a four-month break from Vegas last year, only to return to Maria, who not only remembered me by name, but asked specifically how my business was doing, remembering intimate details from the last time I'd gambled there. Competitor casinos, are you listening? THIS is customer service.. . While I've stayed at many Vegas properties, both on-strip and off, many five-star and world-class and yada yada yada properties... Nothing quite compares to the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas experience. 24-hour room service, the best nightclub in the country, incredible ambience and decor, breathtaking views... But most of all, the best people in the industry I've ever met. Keep doing your thing Cosmopolitan, and I'll keep coming back for more.
Beautiful casino, but no poker room.  . . No poker room? No thanks.
This place is GREAT. People are friendly and very courteous, the room service I like so much, room is super clean and fresh every time I leave and come back. Not sure about the casino though.
Being chic can be elegant. However, being chic can also be tacky. But being simply elegant can be eternally beautiful. Unfortunately, the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is of the middle. We stayed here for our best friend's bachelor party. Upon entering the lobby, you are greeted with tall pillars of flat screen TV that boasts different wallpaper designs thought the day. Okay, that is pretty cool. Upon entering our City Room, the 'chicness' abound every facet of the room. The flat screen TV is surrounded by a circular raised panel, odd wall paper designs, a peeping tom shower, and so on.... . Okay first things first: one of the sink is clogged, and both bedside lamps aren't working. Not too good for a fairly new hotel. Also the hi-tech switches stopped when you get to the loo where you get a tradition light switch. For me that shouts aloud for being discontinuous. . . Being chic is that main theme of Cosmo. But in my humble opinion, their chicness is very convoluted and disjointed. Their theme may be hip to most in 2014 but would it still fly in 2024? I would think they would have to continually renovate to keep up with the latest trends. Whereas Bellagio, Encore, or Palazzo for example, are simply elegant.  All they have to do is continue upkeep and they will remain beautiful, as aforementioned. . . However, The Cosmo being at the heart of the strip, is undeniable. Plus the fact that they have the most awesome valet service and crew, The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas evens out at 3 stars.
Is it pricey? Yes! But who cares? When you come to Vegas you go big or you go HOME! The lobby is gorgeous, casino was awesome, immaculate view of the bellagio fountain, LOVED it!!  My room has a shower in the middle so some can watch you shower, awesome. The pools are super fun, great restaurants, very clean, going again in May!
This hotel is by far one of my favorite from any of the places I've traveled. It was modern, chic, and yet comfortable. You felt a part ofthe crowd and the party while you were in the perspective areas, but as soon as you went to your room it was just serene. No noise complaints from this sensitive sleeper! The shower and Japanese soaking tub were a wonderful surprise! My only issue would be to be CAREFUL of the tile coming out of the shower... it is tile and there is no texture to it. I slipped my first night, luckily it wasn't too bad...
I have stayed at various hotels in Las Vegas - Excalibur, Monte Carlo, Luxor, Flamingo, Circus Circus, Tropicana, and Stratosphere when I was younger; more recently the Aria as I have evolved into a more mature vacationer. This place was our hotel in a recent stay this week. The room was amazing - we had 69th floor with a north facing terrace. We had a view of the Bellagio fountains, the Paris, all the way up the strip, with even views of the Mirage volcano at night. Our room was flawlessly clean, the housekeeping staff obviously took pride in their work. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Our front desk agent - Will - walked out from behind the desk to greet us and shake our hands and welcome us with a very warm apoproach and smile. We had some trouble understanding how to use a feature of our players card on a slot machine and the agent at the Identity club desk came out from behind the desk, took us to a slot machine of our choice, and walked us through the interface on the machine. We had a great breakfast at the Wicked Spoon, and ended up going to Secret Pizza two times, we liked it so much the first time.. . In summary - despite my experience with other hotels in Las Vegas, this will be our hotel for the foreseeable feature, they wowed us at every opportunity.
i recently went in january for my bachelorette party and again for my honeymoon in march.. . i am so in love with their customer service it's not even funny. everytime i went my rooms got upgraded.. they actually upgraded my honeymoon "one bdrm suite" to a lanai suite which was fucking awesome. we had our own jacuzzi and it was just so.. nice.... . just want to say thank you teresa and the front desk agent (her name started with a B..) for making our trips so worth it.. . we will be visiting again... possibly in july ;)
F#%$ this noise. . . I take clean over fancy anytime. . . . The beds were NASTY-no mattress cover- did not use fitted sheets. Had a naked down comforter (no duvet) with stains. . . This one was the icing-After a hot clean shower I go to put on the robe they provide. As I start getting ready I notice something in my pocket--------I find disgusting DIRTY g-string panty in my robe pocket. . . I don't think I'll be staying here. . . The hotel is  beautiful, hip, trendy, and yes a great day club and night club but when I'm paying $$$$  to stay here-please keep up the quality. Starting with the rooms first and then move on to the disgusting carpeting around the halls.
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!. . The good stuff:. Brilliant art installation in the lobby, even though it stopped working a few days after I arrived . . Beautiful room and a secluded pool called the Bamboo. . . On with the bad stuff:. My room and those of others in my party had bathtub poltergeists that would cause a single jet or two to go off in the night. Not making this up. And it was LOUD. . . The nitwit that checked me in never bothered to activate my key cards. So I sat in a sweaty puddle of exhausted traveler in the hallway for 30 mins before someone let us in and then it was still somehow our responsibility to go down stairs and get it all sorted. The only person who was actually helpful during this whole ordeal was the housekeeper who rang down for someone to come let us in. It was truly miserable.. . Let's see...it was overpriced--I'm sorry, but you can't charge that much for a hotel just because you're next to the Bellagio!!! And at least the Bellagio understand that there are certain times of day when you lower your table minimums. The Cosmo had $25 blackjack at 11 AM on a Sunday. . . And many of the other guests strongly resembled the cast of the Jersey Shore. Just FYI.
I am not a huge fan of hotels and casinos, but this is by far one of my favourites. It's modern, stylish, fun, and eclectic. They have fantastic bands, performances, many different restaurants from a casual pizza place to a beautiful Greek and seafood place. They have the most relaxing and amazing spa suites. Just make sure leave enough time to deal with the driveway traffic if you're driving to the hotel.
Very trendy upscale modern hotel which draws a very trendy hip  crowd.  If you are looking for a quiet room, then this hotel is NOT for you.  The walls are paper thin and I could hear our neighbors music and voices even when I know they weren't being very loud.The doors are heavy and slam shut so was woken up whenever anyone was arriving or leaving their rooms.  We were on the 42nd floor facing The Bellagio could hear all the street noise and even the fountains.  Last time I stayed at The Bellagio and faced the fountains and couldn't hear a thing.  The rooms are very comfortable and spacious.   The lighting system was confusing, the main switch turns all the lights on and off.  We could not figure out how to turn on the bedside lamp even though there was a switch for it, so we had to either have all the lights on or off and could not control them by the bed..  I would only recommend this hotel if you want to spend the money and hang out with the young trendy Vegas crowd and plan to stay up all night and party, otherwise you won't sleep.
First time staying at the Cosmopolitan, absolutely loved it! Gorgeous suites with balconies overlooking the Bellagio fountains and Strip. One of the only resorts with balconies in Vegas. Great service throughout the hotel, extremely friendly and helpful staff willing to go out of their way in the interest of good service. Wonderful food at the Milos Greek restaurant -- most unusual and delicious imported fish selection. China Poblano -- fantastic Mexican/Asian fusion menu in a casual setting. Must try the margarita with frothed salt on top. Lovely buffet at the Wicked Spoon. Caught the Midnight show at Rose.Rabbit.Lie -- quite a nice burlesque style show with incredible talent. Very cool vibe at the Boulevard Pool on the rooftop. A must visit for a warm weather day. Would highly recommend this hotel for a visit to Vegas!
Beautiful. I'm talking like Liberace's-bedazzler-threw-up-in here, beautiful. Well, his blinged-out ride landed there.. . I will qualify this review, as we did not stay here, but we played here. Our friends stayed here, so we checked out their rooms. I have to say I was a bit jealous of the beautiful view of the Bellagio lake, and I'm fond of C.O. Bigelow products. But, I had to laugh when they showed us the peep-show shower. Yep, an involuntary peep-show that is controlled from the outer wall of the shower. I'm sure all of the boys who shared this room... didn't shower all weekend.. . The chandelier bar was very sparkly. I'd hate to be the person who has to feather-dust it every day. This bar turned out to be a pretty decent spot in which to watch the last Super Bowl. Too bad the last Super Bore was such a dud. . . Secret Pizza is also hidden away in this hotel, and it was a life saver. We were able to order whole pizzas (or by the slice) and bring em down to the sparkly bar while watching the game. Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this pizza until I already spent $15 on 3 tiny street tacos from China Poblano on the 2nd floor. . . Next time, I'd probably stay here - good location on the strip, peek-a-boo shower fun, and secret pizza.
Nice lobby.. You better bring your own drawers because they did not have them here.. I have to leave my under clothes in my suitcase.. When we arrived to our room, the bathroom was dirty. Beer bottles in the trash can, towels on the floor, bathroom counter was not clean, soap had been used and the bathroom toilet had urine inside. The living room had beer bottle caps sitting on the table. The iron was sitting in the night stand. They gave us a room that was never cleaned. There was long hair all in the bed and on the pillows. East tower 36floor. Missed dinner waiting for them to clean the room. Hour later, the house keeping lady said they don't have any towels. Still no shower after a long day.. Bad experience..
Haven't stayed at any other hotel since Cosmo opened. Must get a wrap around suite with a strip/fountain view to really enjoy the balcony. It's a very lively hotel/casino so if your going to complain about noise and all that, stay somewhere else.
Hands down the BEST hotel we've stayed at in Vegas. We were in the Terrace Suite overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. The staff was very friendly. Will, was the guy who checked us in, and gave us great service. Only two cons: a little mishap with the keys not being activated and probably the biggest con is how long the elevators take to go up to your room or to go down to the lobby. That's the only reason this place got 4 stars. We definitely will be staying here again!
