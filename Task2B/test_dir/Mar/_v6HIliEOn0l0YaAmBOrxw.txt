This place is doable...It's not too expensive and not to extravagant as the hotels accross the street but affordable and clean. Definitely in the middle or end whereever you look at it to the nearest attractions (Wynn diagnally across the street where you have Tryst and can walk towards Encore where you have XS and Surrender - if you're a clubby person, across the street there's Palazzo and Venetian etc etc. you get the point). If you're not clubbing then you still got those hotels that's willing to take your money hehe.. . I actually liked this place, my friends not so much. We stayed at the second to the highest floor before the Penthouse I think? According to my friend, the walls are pretty thin. After a night out of partying and wishing it was noon. My friend thought she was hearing things at 8 in the morning! After coming home at 4 am!!! She kept saying that she hears the elevator going up and down...don't know but after listening to her it felt that I could hear it too...we tried to complain to the front desk but what can they do about it? They tried to give us another room but unfortunately we had a connecting room so we weren't about to switch. We (I mean she) kind of had to live with it for another night lol.. . We had the view of the street. The downstairs was a bit annoying though you can still see the Pirate show going down every hour? or half an hour? forget. But the whole fire works thing can keep you awake if you try to take a nap during the night but why would you?
My husband and I stayed there over a weekend (Saturday - Monday). The check in was okay. The lady wasn't friendly, but it was easy. Our room was ok. I've had way better rooms at less expensive hotels. We were really disappointed at the tv and cable. We came with a group of friends so we had time to relax in the room before meeting up again. Not only were channels limited, the tv would freeze. I was also disappointed at the lack of restaurant options and the food available. Over all I wouldn't recommend or return.
My husband and I really enjoyed our stay!!  We got a killer deal and definitely got more for our money!  Check in was a breeze... We were given lots of 2 for 1 vouchers, as well as 2 free buffet vouchers.  Our room was very clean and modern.   The bed was super soft and comfortable.  The hotel to me was nice.  We really enjoyed Gilly's.  I had a great steak salad!  The buffet was ok.  Nothing to impressive... It was free... So I can't complain.  The casino area wasn't too smokey except middle of the night.. My husband attempted to gamble a little and gave up because all the smokies were out.   I love that there are 2 Starbucks, and a Walgreens right across the street.  I highly recommend visiting the Wynn and seeing the show La Reve.  It's unbelievable!!   We would totally come back!!
Pros- Great prices, great view, nice room.. . Cons- . NO Coffee maker or lobby coffee service.  You can, however, trek to Starbucks in your pjs for overpriced coffee.  Of course that means you have to meander thru the smoke-filled casino to get it.. . Front desk is a joke!  Stood in line 45 minutes to check in.  This is after 4.5 hours on an airplane.. . The casino bar is TERRIBLE.  The bartenders were so rude.  You're supposed to get free drinks if you're playing the games at the bar. (They require a $20 minimum and $1  bets).  They still charged us every time.  When we inquired we were told they didn't know we were playing and it was too late to undo the charges.  But worse that this, they were just plain unfriendly.. . Cab- apparently if you don't tip the doorman he refuses to shut the door of the cab.  We had no idea we were supposed to tip this guy for doing nothing but standing outside blowing a whistle.  He flat-out refused to shut the cab door.  It was ludicrous!!  Our cab driver cursed him all the way to our destination.. . Outlets-  You wouldn't believe the gymnastics I had to perform in order to charge my phone.  The only plug I could find was on an overloaded power-strip under the bed.  Every time the power strip moved the lamp came unplugged as well as the phone!!. . TV- don't expect to watch television here.  There were maybe 6 channels that actually showed up on the tiny (like 15 inch) televisions and even they jumped around.
Treasure Island wasn't as bad as I expected it to be from all the reviews. . . Me and my boyfriend ending up staying here because it was the cheapest hotel for the weekend. We spent about $260 for 3 days and 2 nights, thats including the resort fee. The room and bathrooms were nice and spacious. The beds were super comfy and the pillows felt like clouds. . . My only complaint was that the cleaning person did not come and fix the room. We left early Saturday morning and came back in the afternoon thinking we were gone long enough for our room to be cleaned and it wasn't.. . Overall our stay was nice. Check in was fast, but that was probably because we came around 8pm on Friday. Check out was easy, we just did it from our TV in the room and dropped the keys in the drop box by the elevators on the first floor.
Attended a wedding here so I decided to spent the night as well.. . I was "upgraded to a petite suite" when I checked in, only to find out they upgraded me to a handicap accessible room.. . I was told to call in after 8am to request a late checkout. I called at 10am to find out that a late checkout would cost an extra $50. What?! What hotel charges for late checkouts?! Especially on daylights savings day when you have just lost an hour!!! . . Never staying here again.
Treasure island is a more than passable hotel casino and a pretty good value to boot.. . I arrived here for a conference and moved the line quickly at check-in.  The gal wasn't overly curt but she wasn't very friendly.  The hotel is trapped between its 90's "bring the kids" past (the way I remember it as a kid) and the need to modernize and shed its tackiness-something I don't envy them trying to do.  In the end, it doesn't work, its still tacky with a pseudo modern veneer that doesn't mix, so I don't recommend spending a ton of time in the casino if you are staying here.. . Pros: the room was spacious, clean, and mostly exceeded my expectations.  The bed was nice, and the restroom was spacious and had great bath and countertops.. . Cons: views are hit or miss, the walls are thin so you will hear noise, the casino is very smokey and not that hip, no in-room coffee machines, the tv is small, and the hotel rooms don't have power outlets that you can find without a treasure map of your own, which despite the name of the hotel, they do not provide.
Love pirates? Love adventures on the high seas? Love women wearing tight clothes, looking like a pirate talking about adventures on the high seas? If you answered yes to the first 2 then treasure island is the place for you. If you answered yes to the third then anywhere is Vegas is the place for you... . Anyway, treasure island, or TI, is a great place to stay! Vegas is the place you go to spend money and try to win some. So much so that I didn't even realize the TI had a pool until AFTER I left. Crazy!. . The rooms are very nice. Great views.. . At night they have their pirate ship battle show. It's awesome. But can easily be canceled due to wind conditions. Don't want anyone getting hurt. They make up for it by taking pictures with the performers in the lobby. Something that would've happened after the show. I'd watch the show from across the street or maybe get there early. It's gonna get crowded fast!. . I loved my time there. I would for sure come back here
Decent and good location.  I didn't care for the casino though.. . Room was fine and as others said, bathroom was a good size.  Other reviews complained about the number of outlets, but there are 4 in the bathroom, if you can make that work.  We paid extra for a strip view and were able to see the pool and pick the right time to head down.  I could also see the volcano show at the Mirage from the room (but couldn't hear much).  I didn't think it was too noisy (from the strip or from inside the hotel).  But I almost subtracted one star for the unthinkable that happened:  the maid completely disregarded the privacy sign on the door handle and came barging in anyway.  While my husband was in the shower and I was getting dressed!!  Luckily I had the extra "top lock" locked, but I am still angry about it.  When I expressed my displeasure, she said she was "checking to see" if we were in there.  WTF.  . . You get coupons to use within the hotel.  I'm sure these change, but ours included 2 or 3 "buy one, get one" drinks and 4 buy-one-get-one meals.  The buffet had a lot of options, but the food wasn't very good.  We used the Kahunaville breakfast and dinner coupons and thought it was good.  Didn't get a chance to use the other free dinner coupon for the Seafood Shack, because they open at 5:00 and we were generally on our way by then.. . I would stay here again as long as the prices stay low.  I felt they were still a little high for the weeknights that we were there (over $100 for Tues/Wed nites).. . I wouldn't recommend this for kids.  We found drunk people passed out in the floor lobby on Friday morning.
Ti doesn't deliver.  Inexpensive hotel with poor customer service.  Check in took forever.  We booked two rooms, both with terrible views. I asked for one room with a better view. NO.  Hotel made it clear, we were stuck in two terrible rooms.  Later, we had a drink issue at the bar near casino.  $15 for two drinks btw.  Waitress noticed the problem, but we had to PLEAD for resolution and were overcharged for the effort.  We drank elsewhere after that.   Valet parking overfilled on Friday and Saturday nights, so difficult to park car when we came back from a show.  . . Honestly, Ti was cheap rooms.  Hotel lost a lot of our money:  We did all of our Dining, Clubbing, Gambling outside of the hotel.   Ti is now dark, dated and really smoky smelling.  One positive: the location. Otherwise, not worth it. Next time, I'll stay elsewhere.
Hmm...maybe 4.5 stars is more appropriate, but I'm a fan of rounding.... . I stayed at Treasure Island this past week and had a great experience.  Everything from start to finish was a total breeze.  In fact, I didn't want to jinx it until the end when everything went just as planned.. . Three important things to note about my stay here:. 1. INSANELY comfortable beds. 2. Excellent buffet. 3. Surprisingly fast internet. . Alright, so the other reviews are not lying!  The beds here are out of this world comfortable.  I woke up every morning in the drowsy/deep sleep feeling where it was nearly impossible to actually get out of bed.  The mattresses here beat my own personal one, and it's not even close.. . If you aren't basking in the 'comfortable-ness' of the beds, make your way down to the buffet in the hotel.  A buy one get one free coupon is included with your stay, so two people will eat an amazing buffet dinner for $28.  Can't beat that!  I had lobster ravioli with shrimp, pizza, pasta, ribs, sushi, chocolate cake, chocolate strawberries, and mini-doughnuts.  Okay, that was split between two people with small portions!  However, if you want to try and take all of that on by yourself, more power to you!. . Last (but certainly not least) the internet was surprisingly fast in the rooms.  Internet is included with the daily resort fee, so you pay nothing extra.  It is simple to connect, reliable, and allowed me to stay in touch with the world.  A definite bonus over other hotels I have experienced in the past.. . Overall, I would totally stay here on my next trip.  It is conveniently located next to the Fashion Show Mall and fairly priced.. . 4.5 - 5 stars.
This review is for my stay during 06/2013. . The suite itself was very kept up. Nothing broken. No mold. Very comfy beds. Decent couches. Large living space. 2 FULL restrooms. Prompt room service. . . The ONLY thing that went wrong:. My group of 12 people must have spent over 200 dollars on those huge souvenir cups from Fat Tuesday. We left to go eat, came back, all the cups were thrown out by the scumbag maids. It may not seem like a big deal to other people but let's be honest, when you pay for those drinks you are basically paying for the CUP. I have been to Vegas numerous times and this has never been an issue in any other hotel that I have stayed at. I have a feeling they were mad because the room was messy but isn't it their job to clean? Totally unacceptable.
Went there for the pirate show. I guess they cancelled that in November, Neither of our room keys worked right and our toilet ran the whole time even after we told the front desk, I can get over all this, but after spending three days in the hotel gambling, I talked to a pit boss who told me I needed to talk to a host for a comp room. Talked to a host who was dismissive, did not comp anything, and told me "good luck finding a better deal"... I did. At least Golden Nugget appreciates their rewards players.
We spent $800.00 on a suite to have a fun weekend in Vegas. We found the bed was short sheeted, there was a nasty green fungus between the glass and top of bed side table, the internet we were charged for was not working. It took 45 minutes and finally a trip down to the front desk to speak to someone about the problems.  When we asked for a different room, they said there were none available. When we told them of the conditions of the room, we were basically told you paid for it, deal with it. Never again will I stay at this hotel!
I think Treasure Island is a solid bet for those wanting an affordable and centrally located hotel in Las Vegas.  Rooms were not super lush but very adequate.  The first night we checked in, we got the handicapped access room and we didn't like the shower set up in the bathroom.  The front desk got us a new room the next day and as my parents were coming in then, arranged for adjoining rooms.. . We booked through Priceline and got a pretty good deal although the Resort Fee is a bit annoying at $28/day.  This gave us a 2 for 1 buffet coupon, free access to the gym, wi fi, local telephone service. . . Beds were comfortable.  Flat screen TV's were ridiculously small.  Elevators were fast.  Casino was good ... paid 3:2 on blackjack (important because a number of casinos are cutting the pay off to 6:5).  Location was great!  We took the tram to Mirage a few times and the bridge over to the Palazzo for Walgreens and Bouchon Bakery.  I would stay here again.
Great stay, beds were very comfy. Got free buffet deal with our stay from orbitz. We payed 25$ extra to check in early and got a few perks with that which was alright i guess. A 2 for 1 buffet was one of the.  Still would like to be a little closer to center of strip. Otherwise we didnt have any complaints!
