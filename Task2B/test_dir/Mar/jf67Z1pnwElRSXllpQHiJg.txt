This airport is the absolute best. The layout is grand and spacious; relative to the Strip, it's so convenient and to the surrounding residential parts of town as well; there are always enough TSA agents so the lines move quickly. And, if you didn't get your gambling fix while you were there, there are slot machines in the terminals. . . Another great thing about Vegas.
Chocolates are delicious! Better than sees candy. But the service was terrible. Very rude. . . Sorry there is no picture; I ate it too fast. :)
Easy airport to get in and out of. Baggage Claim takes a long time off of any flight. One time saw a baggage handler, on the Tarmac, throwing - not placing - boxes into a plane - boxes looked like they had something valuable in them. Overall, a good airport to fly in and out of - not difficult to get around in.. . Down sides: if you are picking someone up they don't have an off-site "cell phone" wait area were you can wait. You have to keep driving around the airport. Also if you need to charge your phone prior to a flight - GOOD LUCK - they are very limited in electrical outlets. Also bad food choices around the gates...
Okay soooo the Vegas Airport isn't all that nice. I have to say that the only redeeming quality is that it has slot machines but then again...it's a little unnecessary.. . -The gates are a little hard to get to. You have to run around in a circle to get to the other side. . -The walkways are narrow and cluttered by tons of trashy kiosks and slot machines....TOO MANY SLOT MACHINES. -The bathrooms are filthy. . But on the upside they have tons of food choices! . . Until next time LV....
Oh Las Vegas McCarran International, how I love and hate you! . . Gates A, B, C are in an older wing of the airport and badly need upgrading to meet today's modern traveller need. My two top complaints about the older terminals aside from the boring old carpet and strange color scheme is 1. It takes forever to get around this older terminal, there aren't enough people movers (Moving Walk Ways) 2. Where are the power outlets! They seriously need to get that electrician into the waiting areas to bring in more power! Charging ports are at a premium. Maybe partner with advertiser's like all things Vegas? Get someone to pay for it :-). . Now the terminal that Delta, and the legacy carrier's are in... That's a beauty, with new modern design, shops, restaurants, and easy to move around. The wide huge open ceilings are a major plus. Still power outlets seem to be scarce. . . All in all Vegas ain't bad. Will anyone care really about the airport? Probably not. After all this is the city of lost wages, and McCarran is simply shuttling people to all the wonders that reside in this strange sin city.
Why does this airport stand out from all other airports? . . SLOT MACHINES!!!!. . So if you're flight gets delayed you probably wouldn't care :) . . There are recharge zones near the restrooms and the carpet makes you feel like you're in a not-so-fancy hotel.
This was my first time in Terminal 3 since I was flying Virgin America to LA and I do have to say that it's pretty awesome because it's new, modern, open, and spacious. Checking in is a breeze if you must do so. All the airlines are all lined up with awesome LED screens indicating each airline's specific counter. . . The security now has two separate lines - one for regular screens and individuals who have TSA Pre-Check. The TSA Pre-Check line moved pretty quickly even if it looks pretty long. Just remember folks, put all your stuff in your bag and don't have any metal like belts, coin change, etc. on your or in your pockets. It'll make the line move much more quickly!. . After getting through security, there are plenty of screen to inform you of you arriving and departing flights. The terminal is pretty big with huge windows that let in plenty of light. In true Vegas style, there are slot machines around every corner in case you have extra time before your flight.. . There are plenty of food options such as Pei Wei, Burger King, Carl's Jr., and Coffee Bean. I think there are a couple more options, but I noticed these just from looking for food. They also had your basic stores in case you wanted some snacks, reading material, Las Vegas memorabilia, etc. The bathrooms are also modern and clean, which is always a plus.. . The terminal is very accommodating to tech savvy folks. There is free wi-fi for your use and there's also a dedicated charging station. It would've been better if there were chargers are each seat, but that's just me being picky.. . If I have to fly to Las Vegas again, going through Terminal 3 would be awesome. It has everything I need to literally make the time fly! You will not be disappointed!
Hey, it's an airport. They did their job. I do wish they had more restaurants on the other side of security. I stopped into one lounge and all they had was 7-11 style sandwiches in a cooler for $8 a pop! But as far as airports go in general, it's decent.
Well, "Viva Las Vegas!". . This seems to be a hub for Virgin America. Interesting, interesting.. . That's about it.
Can't say I was impressed by this airport, in the least. . . Electrical outlets were virtually non-existent, and I was on a two-hour layover in dire need of some power for my electronics. So, I stalked one of the seats at the "recharge" station until someone moved. I put quotes around "recharge" because only one outlet out of the three in front of my seat actually functioned properly. I would've loved to grab a drink at a bar/restaurant, but none of those had plugs either. . . Slot machines are the bane of my existence. I thought the carpet was dingy, there was extremely limited seating, and basically, I'm a spoiled brat.
This airport is newer, clean, and has a lot of sizzle, but its poorly laid out.  For only two terminals, you have to take a shuttle.  The security checkpoint is muddled with overlapping lines and unevenly spread TSA booths.  Food options are okay, with various tourist boutiques,
Where to begin.. Security lines are the worst here, they're so slow and ALWAYS seem to be long.. . Terminal 1 is so outdated, its all carpet and there is slot machines everywhere, it's true Vegas. Terminal 3 is a lot more modern with comfortable seats while waiting for your flight. There's a few slots around, not as much as Terminal 1 though. Nothing exciting at this airport. There's almost no electrical plug ins at either Terminal too.. . If you're a vegan it will be basically impossible to eat here. I had to make a bunch of modifications for my meal at Chophouse Brewery. I suggest eating before coming.. . I've been to this airport multiple times and its just not that great.. At least there's free WiFi.
They have trains! To other platforms! How civilised is this?! I'd totally forgotten about the trains.. . And the buses you can get directly from the Strip to the Airport. Or you can even get a shuttle to pick you up from your hotel to the Airport.. . Basically this is one well serviced Airport!! (Sydney International could learn a few things from here). . Granted it's a bit weird walking through the airport that has pokies scattered through it, however it's Vegas no? There are pokies everywhere! . . This being my 2nd visit here, I have to say I totally forgot to gamble. I know I know. I shopped instead. . . Getting back to the airport however. It's clean, it's tidy, there was a wee bit of confusion trying to find a place to plug in the phone, but after much searching I found that there were plugs on the floor infront of pillars. Yes dearlings, look on the ground!. . Neat, tidy, shops handy... I do love Vegas Airport.
What better way to leave the city of sin than to have a shot on the way to the plane and a last try at the slots :)
I like this airport It's big and a lot of places to eat from......
I'm not a fan of airports in general (who is?), but McCarran isn't too awful.  It has its good points. . . - Trams to terminals are fairly fast and run well.  There was never too long of a wait.. - The TSA security line videos were actually somewhat amusing.  Obviously catered to the Vegas market in particular.  But they were kind of good for a laugh.. - Friendliest TSA/security personnel I've ever run into. I got an apology for a pat-down, go figure.. - On the ball with gate changes and announced them EARLY enough for people to get there.  Thank you for that!. - Must say I've never seen an airport with slot machines before... - FREE WIFI!!!! Something the Miami airport could take note of, eh-hem .. . Of course, there's always bad.....  . - Restaurants/food places close SHOCKINGLY early.  Vegas is a 24 hour town - 9:30pm isn't going to cut it for someone who's hungry.. - Terminal 3 security, while friendly, took FOREVER to get through!. - Lack of outlets/charging stations for electronics.  I actually saw two people get into a verbal skirmish over a free outlet.  More needed.. . Other than the above three bad points, McCarran isn't that awful.  Much better than many airports I've been to.  Just make sure your batteries are charged and that you eat before you show up, and you're good to go.. . 3.5.
You can absolutely live in this airport! Check-in is easy, TSA is fast, and the food options are amazing near the gates.
Little slice of Vegas with slot machines throughout the airport. As a non-smoker, I found the smoking lounges a turn off as smoke poured out when I walked by. Not a bad place for a layover.
Great team of people here.  Faster WiFi than LAX.  Fun security videos.  Lots of shops.  Yes, oh yes, they have a Cinnabon in Gate D.. . My flight did get cancelled going home, but the attendant at American was extremely helpful and spent a good amount of time trying to get me a decent flight home.  I lost faith in a lot of our US airlines due to poor customer service, but she renewed a bit of my faith.  I wish more of our US flight teams were like her.  I'm getting home about 4 hours later than expected, but I'm pretty sure it could've been worse.  She did a lot of digging before we finalized a new flight (most getting me in hours later).  She was extremely helpful.. . Tammy at American, you rock!
It's a good way to get into Las Vegas - here's why:. . 1 - there are salons in the airport, what more can you ask for?. 2 - the airport is less than 15min from the strip, what more can you ask for?
Going to an airport is never really fun. The line for checking in was super long and there was only 3 people working. My fault for not printing the boarding pass out before we got there.. . When we went through security I had to put my hands out so they could do some kind of scanning. When I asked what it was for they said it was for "chemicals". Um ok. We were prepared to take our shoes off and our sweatshirts like we had to do on our first flight but this time I got yelled at for taking my sweatshirt off and it was all so confusing. . . SIGNS PEOPLE. Signs would be awesome.  Here is a few examples.. . 1.) Please use BOTH LINES. . 2.) Leave your shoes and sweatshirts on (because that is not the norm now). . 3.) Walk this way (because it's super confusing and nothing was in a straight line). . Once we got through that fun stuff we hit the bathroom where I got a nice breeze while sitting on the toilet from a blower fan that was on the floor.. . Once we actually got to the waiting area everything was fine but it all felt slightly tramatizing by the time we got there.
Not that many outlets for people waiting for their flight. Also, most outlets are on the ground which is inconvenient. . . It's nice to have slot machines everywhere, so if you're of the gambling variety, you can stay occupied while you wait for your flight. The airport is pretty chaotic, similar to the city, but not hard to navigate.
My favorite things about this airport are: 1) it's location - it's basically on the strip.  Flying into it is so cool - landing amongst all the lights at night; 2) in true Vegas fashion, there are slot machines everywhere; 3) it's very clean, bright, and modern feeling.  . . My least favorite things about this airport: 1) there aren't electric outlets where you can recharge your electronics.  Instead, you have to find a charging station and pay to do so.  Lame. 2) It's hot.  I know it's in a desert and all, but so many people and windows don't help keeping it comfortable either; 3) I didn't interact with a single friendly person the entire time - gate agents, shuttle drivers, security, food employees, no one even smiled.  I guess not everyone is from the south?
I've gone to Vegas so many times, I cannot count them.  And I'll go back many more times.  So, without a doubt, I will have to go through McCarran.  The terminals are nice enough with shops, kiosk and eateries spread throughout.  Security, like most airports, can be slow and tedious.  The shuttle rides could be a long wait and ride, unless you time it perfectly.  Then they built the new Terminal 3.  Much nicer with a shorter security check in and shorter shuttle ride.  The biggest issue is trying to figure which terminal you must fly out of.  The rental car center is a million miles from the airport, so you must give yourself ample time to turn in your car.  But what makes it nicer than regular airports are a number of things.  First, it is literally on the strip.  Your taxi ride is a skip and hop away to and from the airport.  Then, with the new Terminal 3, it is really nice and so far has shorten the security lines.  Also, you get free Wi-Fi.  And finally, slots, yup slots in the terminals.  I really don't mind flying in and out of this airport.
I love this airport. Fun shops, good bars and free wifi. Also a great place to people watch. If you go to the end of the c gates there's more private bathrooms and a nuce bar kind of tucked away from the crowds.
Good airport with good transportation and good restaurants and services. They have a tram system that takes you to gates quickly and clean bathrooms. The best thing about LAS is the rental car purchase and return. The return is lightening fast with shuttles right to the terminal. Add in a TSA pre program and you have everything you could want in an airport. MIA is still way better though. :-)
Confusing layout. Annoying that the options for food are so significantly different between concourses, depending on what you're flying you may have access to a lousy selection. Shoot for the D concourse, or hope that you can convince security to escort you from ABC to D.
The only reason I give it a star is for terminal 3 and the D gates. Beware if you need to go to the A/B gates!  Security lines are a mile long and the employee/wheelchair line usually has 18,000 wheelchairs trying to get through!  I have seen flight crews have to stand behind  all of the wheelchairs! Absolutely INSANE!!!!!!!! Once you FINALLY get through security, you are welcomed to a very  outdated and old school airport...carpets are dingy, the gate areas smell of stale smoke embedded into the walls and carpets, the moving walkway (when it's working!) is so narrow, people never realize that there is a "WALK" and "STAND" section, passengers do not realize that they are not supposed to have wheelchairs on the moving walkway...I have already witnessed a couple of people in wheelchairs fall flat onto their face when they reach the end of the walkway....this not only creates a hazard to the people in the wheelchairs, but also to those behind them....as a catastrophic domino effect can occur....!!! I hope the county can handle the lawsuits!!!  Also, the restrooms by the A gates are always shut down and dining choices are very limited! Very poorly maintained terminal for a big city like Vegas. Not to mention the zero level area where they pick up and drop off tour groups and limos smells like an elephant/gorilla exhibit in a zoo...apparently, due to the fact all the trash dumpsters are located there!!!! Welcome to Vegas!!!!!! That smell just slaps you in the face!!!!!!!!!!!
Excellent service...clean..organized..nkt too many shops..but usually one is done shopping as theythey've vegas
