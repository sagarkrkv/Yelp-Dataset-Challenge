The price was not bad compared to everywhere else. Visiting you a conference. Rooms are clean not amazing but nice. The suites are a fair accommodation.
Paid $175 for a non-smoking newly renovated Samba Suite.  The upholstery had stains, there were crumbs on the carpet and the room smelled of smoke and deodorizer.  We asked to be moved and were happy with our Samba Suite on the 37th floor until we realized we could've danced to 3am in our own room.  We were able to hear the pounding beats of the Voodoo Lounge from the 51st floor!  I believe the Rio has an obligation to make their guests aware of this significant fact.  Don't get me wrong, we enjoy a good party... Just like my sleep too!
Super disappointed with this property!  I think they must be experiencing some financial difficulty although their occupancy was pretty high. I was here for 5 nights from March 9th. . . I pulled up to the front - waited, waited, looked and looked. There was NO ONE to come get my bags or car.  Yes, it was 5:00 pm on Sunday which is one of their busiest days, but no staff to greet guests.  I went inside to check in counter and said there was no one outside, they then called the bell dept and had someone show up.  When I said I was checking in and handed them my keys they said I had to go to the valet parking spot, drove there and they said oh no, you have to park in the check in lot - which was around the building!  So far, bad impression. No longer can you pull up to a hotel to check in.  You have to park 3/4 miles away.  No doorman to greet you. I ended up carrying my own bags.. . Check in clerk was pleasant, but my "guaranteed" room was not available.  After asking her to check again - 3 times, finally a king bed room appeared.  I was not told a thing about the hotel, no map, nothing - just room keys. I went over to Total Rewards to get my card, and given a little more info.. . Room was clean, spacious and nicely decorated but smelled like bacon.  The housekeeper was super nice and called and had someone come up to spray the room, adjust the temperature in the refrigerator. They all came promptly.  I did notice each day when I returned to the room it smelled like food.  I asked the engineer who came in to adjust the brightness on the TV about it and he said I was above the ventilation fans for a restaurant below.  I was on the 9th floor. It wasn't bad or I would have asked to move. I felt there was something missing from my room - no hotel directory. I called and asked about it, front desk knew nothing about it and I never got one.  Odd, nothing which lists what is here, what hours they are open and what they offer. . . The internet is horrible! the connection time is around 5 minutes and I kept having to login whenever my computer went to sleep, I left with my computer and came back, or changed browsers. . . My biggest disapointment is the Masquerade in the Sky is NO LONGER HERE!!! That is the main reason I made my reservation here :(  Also, the buffet is very expensive.  I seem to remember $14.95 for lunch - it is now $21.95 if you are a total rewards, and dinner is $29.95.  (there is a groupon avail now for dinner,  2 for price of 1) the seafood buffet dinner is $49.95!  Good grief! The buffet looked nice, but it encourages people to eat way more than they should just to get their money's worth.  No wonder America is obese!. . There is a Vietnamese restaurant which wasn't too expensive, kind of fast food like , prices were around $12.95, The sports cafe was next to it with prices starting at $8.95, but you can buy a piece of pizza for $4.95.. . One of the best things about this place was the spa. Very nicely laid out, perfect amenities and very clean. Use is included with the day use fee. Unfortunately it closes at 7:00 PM. The fitness center is located here. My day use fee was supposed to be $22.00 but appears as $24.60 on my bill - I guess they tax it?. . The casino is nothing special, lots of penny slots if you like those. Smoking is allowed in this casino and very noticeable.  All in all, the best things that were here are no longer what make it the best. It is very noticeable that they have cut down on staff.  Vegas is still busy no matter when you come here, I don't get it!. . Pool area is nice but the hours are very limited. It closes at 6:00 PM. Not sure if they have longer hours in the spring and summer, but for March it seemed pretty limited. When I went out there none of the bars or eating places were open. again, staff cutbacks. . . The Starbucks in the hallway on the way to the Ipanema Tower elevators is always open and very busy! Happy hour special: from 10:00PM to 11:00 PM all pastries are $2.00! They have two Starbucks here for your coffee fix. They do have Keurig coffee makers in the rooms,  so if you have a Keurig, bring your coffee pods with you because they don't seem to be available to purchase, or they are $8.00 for 3 (supposed to be in the in-room bar, but mine didn't have any). . I passed a few other restaurants that weren't open so don't know if it was the hour I went by or if they just weren't open. . . TV channel selection was pretty bad, very limited channels.. . Compared to some of the newer hotel casinos, this place isn't that big. Which can be a plus. You only have to walk 3/4 mile to get to your car instead of 1 1/2! Felt isolated from the strip - it isn't walking distance, and the shuttles they have only run every 30 minutes. I wouldn't stay here again unless I was coming to a convention in this hotel. This is part of the very large Caesar's chain which includes Paris, Harrahs, Ballys, Casears.. . Don't expect much in the way of customer service. The bed is comfortable but the pillows are not!
Feels like I got forced into a time machine and got transported back to the 80s. Casino looks really run down... Stay on the strip. Only reason we are here is cause the wife and her gf wanted to see chippendales. Lots of old timers and people that look like they have a gambling problem.
Another stay at Rio.  We like the place even though it's aging. . . Staff is first class. They really seem to work hard at customer service.. . WiFi: slow, included in the resort fee, but only for 1 device. Watch out if you have several phones, ipads, and computers. You'll pay $14 a day for each if you sign in thinking wifi is free. It is, for 1 device only.. . Parking: Always a challenge. Valet is the way to go. They get your car parked safely and retrieve it toot sweet.
Wow, Rio, you need to rethink your penchant for greed over experience.  I've enjoyed staying at your hotel every few years for vacation,  eating at the Voodoo Steakhouse and dancing at the Voodoo lounge.  But this past week when I went and it has been a few years, I was highly disappointed with everything that I loved about the Rio.  No Mardi Gras parade in the sky (why not?  Why get rid of something fun and can enjoy with the kids? It's bad enough the "free shows" are dwindling as it is).  the room, well, I've never stayed at the Ipanema tower, always the Masquerade tower, but geez, never again.  And then there's the whole Voodoo Lounge issue, which is a big one with me-I don't gamble in Vegas, I go clubbing because it's AWESOME!  Always enjoyed the Voodoo Lounge, inside and out, but now-NEVER AGAIN!!!!  Your greed has totally RUINED IT!  First, all the "lounging" can no longer be done, as you have cordoned off all seating booths for those only who order $600 bottle service.  My feet were killing me and I would have liked even a CHAIR to sit down at!  Then, the outside.  The place where I USED to be able to go right to the rail and enjoy the view of the strip.  Nope, now THAT'S cordoned off 10 feet from the edge on all sides with seating for those-AGAIN-ordering $600 bottle service! (by the way, only two groups actually ordered bottle service Saturday night).  So, everyone is basically corraled into a middle section, not the big dancefloor I used to remember, AND there was like, half a dozen pillar/fire heating units, so not only are you squished that you can't move, let alone dance, but now you're worried IF you move, WILL YOUR HAIR CATCH ON FIRE?!  And with my feet already hurting and I can barely see the strip now, I just left after 20 minutes, not even ordering a drink.  So, their greed is backfiring, because I wasn't the only one leaving shortly after arriving, by the way.. Bummer, this was my fav hotel, but now....Luxor?  MGM Grand?  Gonna have to check these out now....bye Rio!
The place little outdated. The hotel is not on the strip but has some good views of the rest of the strip. They have Penn & Teller as a permanent show.
I went to the Rio to see Penn and Teller, who were fantastic. I wasn't initially going to review this place, but my husband and I experienced something that was so shocking that I needed to mention it.. . After the show, like most people who have attended an hour and a half long show, I needed to use the restroom. My husband and I were a bit turned around while looking for the tram to Harrah's in order to get back to our hotel and ended up near the lobby, and ended up deciding to use the bathrooms to the left of the front desk. My husband did his business just fine, but when I went to use the ladies' room just past the VIP lounge, the entrance to the bathroom was barricaded and a very intimidating man was standing behind the barricades with his arms crossed over his chest. I had a feeling I was not going to get to use the restroom, so I returned to the entrance to the men's room to wait for my husband. When he came out, I told him what happened and he told me that two women were in the men's room because this same man was not only belligerent, but threatened to call security on them for trying to cross the barricade.. . My husband and I agreed that we will probably return to see Penn and Teller, but we will not spend money at the restaurants or at the slots because of the egregious behavior of this gentlemen.
I just had a really nice stay here. Yes I agree that the place is starting to age and look a bit outdated compared to all the new stuff on the strip. My room or "suite", was pretty standard for a Vegas room. Not really sure what made it a suite, but for $50 hard to complain. Back in the day the Carnival buffet was the best in town, now very average if that. My positive review however is all about the people here. The front desk lady who checked me in was very pleasant. The waitresses, card dealers, floor bosses, and bartenders here are very personable and fun. Even the other players at the tables make this place a fun spot to stay and play at. All very friendly and social. Drinks are stiff and easy to get everywhere. Lots of gaming choices and space to move around although their slot machines were pretty tight. Low table limits too which is nice. Another great thing is that the place doesn't reek of cigarette smoke like a lot of other places. I would certainly come back to the Rio on my next Vegas trip.
We recently stayed at the Rio.  There were two major problems with our stay - there are huge check-in lines with no place to sit for us old folks and our new tower room had no hot water in the shower!  But for $136 we had a god time, bed was great, food was good but expensive and guest services were good.  Hotel is also very convenient to the freeway system.  But nit being Abe to shower was very bad, had to wash up in the sink.
My room had not been properly cleaned. Bathroom was dirty and someone elses clothes were hanging in th bathroom. A/C worked sometimes and sometimes it blew hot air. Everything is top dollar even the in room coffee which you have to pay for. I stay in Vegas a lot I will never stay here again
We went to see Penn & Teller and the Security Lead Johnny was extremely rude. . He had no regard for sensibilities. Johnny rudely yelled at us that we could not bring in our drinks to the show. Then when the show was almost over we were smoking by the restroom. Johnny came over and strongly grabbed the cigarette from my girlfriends hand and put it out while rudely informing us that it was a non smoking area. Then Johnny slyly said leave now the exit is there while another security agent spoke to us about the show very courteously. He is the most rude security guard who has no clue how to handle the public. Just to be sure it was head security guard Johnny. Very rude and doesn't deserve his job.
so I'm staying at the rio on a business trip and I love it! It's a greatly decorated hotel and the shows they offer are amazing!. The weather was nice, so going to the pool was nice as well.. But what I really appreciated the most was the shoe shining booth that was there. My co workers and I decided to get our shoe shined. They use the best top of line waxes and creams that I use to use when I shined my shoes. It was very professional and I  left with my shoes looking better than when I bought them new! The name was "Goodfellows" if I remember correctly. . I also saw penn and teller at the rio and I'll tell you what- not only were they good magicians but also hilarious ! . Las Vegas was a pretty fun business trip I might say
After booking a room for my birthday celebration, I became concerned reading many of the reviews on Yelp. Much to my relief, Rio turned-out to be a wonderful place to sleep, play and watch a great show. My room, although somewhat dated, was very spacious, clean, comfortable...and the water pressure in the shower was just fine for a hotel that is required to follow stringent local regulations. I didn't smell cigarettes or any other offensive odors, and never a bug. The only loud noises I heard was the train going by a couple times a day. The room itself was great, the view wonderful. The only real complaint was housekeeping never made-up my room during my 2-day stay...but probably my fault...I stayed in bed until early afternoon after a long night of partying and gambling, and I never requested a cleaning.. . I think many on Yelp either expect way too much from a lower cost hotel, or just love to pick their nits. Or maybe there's another Rio Hotel Casino in Las Vegas. The one I stayed at met or exceeded my expectations for the price I paid. This isn't Caesar's people...and none of you spent dearly to stay here.. . Everyone on the staff I encountered, from the check-in desk, the casino staff, the servers in the restaurants, the security, to the bell desk at the end of my stay proved to be polite, friendly and efficient. No one was ever surly or rude. Not one in the bunch.. . The Penn and Teller Show was simply wonderful, and was even upgraded in seat selection because I went early and asked. But will review their show separately. . . The only slight disappointment was the Hash House a Go Go, but not enough to not recommend. Will review separately.. . The Rio Carnival Buffet, which was indeed huge and spectacular, seemed slightly overpriced given the Rio's location in Vegas, especially since the Gold Coast Buffet next door is half the price. I won't bother with reviewing this buffet as it's buffet food, and not much more. You get what you pay for.. . The pool had very restrictive hours, 9am to 6pm, and it never fit my lifestyle. I like to enjoy an early morning swim, around 6 or 7, OR a swim in the evening. I'm not a sun worshiper, and have no use for pools in the daytime. Although the pools were plentiful and beautiful, being closed when I needed them made them worthless.. . The lobby and casino DID smell of tobacco, more than other casino's I visited in Vegas, but by the nit-picky reviews of others, I was expecting to cut thru a fog of cigarette smoke. I never encountered that experience, and my clothes didn't smell of smoke at the end of the night. Lower priced hotels seem to attract a higher volume of smokers by sheer demographics. Wasn't too bad, but longed to return to smoke-free California.. . The Voodoo Lounge on the roof was another disappointment, and will review separately, but just to say that the only thing to buy a ticket for is the view. The club itself was horrible. Thank God I came on a free night.. . The shops were okay, but overpriced for the Rio's location. They needed a discount gift store, and I would have spent more. Spent my dough at the better priced Gold Coast hotel next door.. . Won't complain about the Casino, as you place your bets and takes your chances, but very stingy slots. Beware.. . The resort fee was steep for the lack of a resort. I couldn't use the pool, and I don't go to spas. The WIFI was indeed slow, but much better than dial-up. Some reviewers are funny, expecting lightening fast speed in a massive hotel complex.. . Not sure what the Rio's true market is...it desperately wants to be a luxury strip hotel, but also wants to be known for value. I used the free shuttle to Bally's a lot. Overall, if you're on a budget, or just want to spend your money on other things than lodging, the Rio Hotel Casino is a great place to stay. Don't expect the Bellagio, and you won't be disappointed. Keep expectations limited to the price you're paying, and you'll be rewarded with a wonderful stay. I highly recommend the Rio.
Worst experience, you have to either blind or broke to stay here. Room was dated in early. 80's furniture, drapery,and carpeting .the wall paper was peeling the ceiling had major visible cracks. The room smelled like animals were living there. Stay away!!!!!!!
terrible terrible old ran down hotel!! there was an old moldy banana in our room and from a distance it looked like a mouse... ew!!!! cleaning ladies don't know how to clean... okay so that was fixed they came and cleaned it up and brought champagne and strawberries because the were "fully booked" and couldn't switch our rooms. that was okay. the next day saturday my family took a trip to the baker to vegas run. it was awesome well mean while i was in the pool and room, calling my local friends to meet up with them. keep in mind i was using the hotel room phone... (not knowing i was going to be charged almost $300 dollars) saturday night my family returns and were hanging out in the room when we come across another old moldy banana! like really??? can they clean up?? the shower handle broke off while taking a shower that night as well. (dangerous) sunday! we head to the desk to check out and pay for the 2 nights we stayed.... then a random amount of $700 dollars was charged.... the few phone calls i made were almost $300 dollars! wow! cheap hotel, every other place ive stayed i was never charged for my phone calls. long distance or not. and then there was about 4 to 5 hundred dollars charged for miscellaneous bullshit. if i can give this place no stars i would... cheap old ran down hotel needs to close down... they don't even have the show with the marti gras girls anymore.... that's what they were known for... now i know them as the worst hotel i've ever stayed at.  never again...
Solid value with huge rooms, a nice uncrowded casino and a great pool. Look its a b string hotel Off the strip but close with easy parking. Good shows, clean and a friendly crowd. Overall if you wait too long to make reservations, this is a decent option
Booked a room for $40 a night and was amazed how cheap. The resort fee was kind of lame, but it's where I needed to be. The room is huge and amazing. Little bit of a pain in the ass to get to because of the casino maze. Only real complaint is the vending machine for a soda or water was $5. Uh why?
