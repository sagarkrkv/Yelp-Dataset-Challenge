This place is amazing!! Customer service is great....food is great.....atmosphere is great.. and the price is unmatched if I lived in vegas this would be my all the time breakfast spot. The owner of the shop welcomed my wife and I and he genuinely cares about his customers.
This little inconspicuous restaurant just blew my mind. This is, by a massive margin, the best breakfast experience I've had. The food was exceptional and the service was unparalleled. . . I'd like to talk about the owner for a minute as well. There is a distinct difference between a "boss" and a "leader." This man exemplifies the very definition of a SERVANT leader. He runs his business from the tip of the spear and drags the "cart of business" as it were, from the front just like his employees. I amstill reeling from the experience I had here. . . 11/10!
Hands down best breakfast place in Vegas!! The food was absolutely delicious and everything I wanted. My favorite were the pancakes and sausage. The customer service was outstanding!! The employees were so welcoming and friendly. Will be returning again tomorrow and everytime I come visit Vegas.
BEST breakfast in Vegas and exceptional customer service.  It's off the strip, but worth the drive.  Everything cooked to perfection...a good old American breakfast, just the way restaurants use to serve.  My father who is a retired chef gave it 5 stars as well. I plan to eat here again on my next trip to Vegas!
Great spot away from the strip.  Owner greets you at the door with his relocated Midwestern hospitality!  My husband will be craving his chili cheese omelette for a long time to come.  We'll be back next time we are in Vegas
Breakfast: The one meal that every single person should be able to cook... so when we go out to pay for it - we are all critical because we are all master chefs at making bacon, eggs, and toast right? How hard is that???. . Maybe so, but Mr. Mamas food gets an A+++ in my book for Taste, Freshness, Presentation, Speed, and most importantly AWESOME SERVICE. The owner is super friendly and is hella funny too!. . I miss this place already! Best breakfast/brunch in LV we will be back I hope you guys maintain these aforementioned positive attributes forever!!!
This small breakfast and lunchbreataurant pulls no punches... It is exactley what you would expect from a industrial strip breakfast lunch place.  The decor is simple and relaxed. The food however is fantastic.  I had the manhattan burger. Essentially a patty melt nothing fancy just quality ingredients to make a quality sandwich.  My friend had one of the Omelets which gave me a slight case of food envy, but I had seen the manhattan burg in a old weekly and had already made up my mind to try it and I was not disappointed
This is an excellent place for breakfast. Not your traditional gravy for biscuits and gravy, but was so delicious. Steak and eggs special was top notch. Excellent service, very attentive. Great to find an out of the way restaurant in Vegas that is soooo good!
We went here based on the reviews and were NOT disappointed! We created our own sampler and ordered the short stack of pancakes, a piece of French toast and a 1/2 order of biscuits and gravy. It was all delicious. The biscuits melted in your mouth and were so yummy with the delicious gravy! The bacon and hash browns were perfect and we loved the pancakes and French toast. But besides the food, the service was great and quick. This will definitely be on our list of places to return!
This place knows how to do a simple breakfast very well and they are very inexpensive too. For a weeklong trip here with my fiance, we needed to find places that were mostly affordable. Since we had a car, we didn't mind driving away from the strip to find it. . . We ordered two breakfast combos with flapjacks and everything was cooked well and our dishes looked consistent. The coffee was decent and I would love to try other dishes especially for lunch. . . I'd definitely make a trip out here again, no matter how long my trip is, as long as I have my car.
Came here with high expectations and left a bit underwhelmed. Had a craving for hearty and delicious breakfast food and everything we ordered was just... mediocre for the lack of a better word. I didn't care much for my omelette as it was lumpy and tepid and my boyfriend's steak was grey in color and it had a rubbery texture to it. The venue is off the beaten path but you get to avoid the hustle and bustle of the strip. Their servers were friendly and helpful.
The food is good, nothing that is really any different than you'd get anywhere else, but it is yummy and fast. The five stars is for the service. The owner is out there busting his ass with the staff, and checks on every customer.  It's phenomenal customer service that makes you want to become a regular. Oh I almost forgot, it's pretty decently priced- breakfast for two was $20.
Delicious breakfast! We shared some pancakes which I highly recommend. My husband had the breakfast burrito which he thought was great also. Great atmosphere and service. Best meal we had in Vegas so far and it was the most affordable. Can't be beat!
Very good breakfast. Food is very fresh and tasty. Chicken fried steak smothered with a maple sausage gravy.. . My wife had the omelette with the avocado also very good fresh.. . This is a Popular place so get there early. Staff is friendly and efficient.
This is a must stop when you come to Vegas! The country fried steak is slap the chef amazing!!!!!
Seriously...if you have transportation, put this place on your breakfast list. Fresh, tasty, filling breakfast choices, all with amazing service from Mr. Mama himself. Oh, and it's the best value in town and the best staff in town.
These guys are the best. I've eaten every day on my Vegas business trip here for 20 days straight. Mr mammas will be my first stop on my next trip. . 6 eggs!
This place is close to my house and so low key. While waiting for our table (took 25 minutes on Saturday for brunch time), the host told us that the majority of their business used to be tourists. Now, more locals are noticing this gem. The decor is definitely nothing special, but will hold you while you scarf down their massive pancakes. Will definitely be coming back for my simple breakfast fix.
This place is superb.  Not only is the food delicious but the owner is a hands-on control freak in a good way!.  You feel so taken care of and welcome when you step inside. . . We had the specials which included our drinks -- around $10 each.  I LOVED the cinnamon chip pancakes and the ribeye steak and eggs with hashbrowns and toast.  The coffee was decent too.  I'll def. be back when I return to Vegas.
All I can say is WOW! The owner greets you at the door and makes you feel like your a regular. The food is excellent as are the prices. We might end up eating only at this place during our vacation. Thanks Mr Mama!
Amazing! The best french toast, biscuits, hashbrowns and omelet (california) I have had in forever! I came with a party of 8 and everyone was pleased from the toddlers to the elders. Owner is a very outgoing and personable man, food came quick and the service was very good! We will definitely be back!
This place is awesome Location is a bit off the main drag, and there may be a bit of a wait. But that's it for the negative. Nick the owner is friendly makes you feel like family.. Good food, good prices, good service . What more can I say. Check this place out when in Vegas it certainly is worth the trip
Amazing breakfast! Great prices, excellent service, and a perfect way to take a break from the overpriced, touristy strip fare.
Nice local business in las vegas. Nick the owner is very personable and greets u at the door. It seems there is usually a wait cuz he holds a clip board with the wait list and takes your name with an estimation of when u can be seated. U can also do take out as well as sit down.. . Venue is on the narrow side with two long rows of tables and chairs, still a good size. And everything is blue guessing his fave color to walls to tables to chairs and its a nice touch that he puts vintage pics of his family on the walls. Being a family oriented person myself I could def appreciate that.. . Menu varies from breakfast food to comfort food to subs and sandwhiches and burgers. My fiancee and I had breakfast the mamas French toast, with 3, eggs n two sausage patties, and pancakes and bacon with a brownie. All was delicious.  Pancakes were fluffy and perfect and the brownie was ginormous and it was served nice and warm. And it was only like $6.75 and $8.75 for huge servings.. . Service was good nick checked in on us when we were waiting for our main dishes and asked to staff to put a rush on our order. Turned out a big takeout order came in and they were catching up. We didnt ask too and they comp'ed the brownie. . . Overall nice breakfast eatery. Would come again for the chicken fried steak plate!
This place is awesome! Great food, great prices! If you get here after 10am there might be a wait but worth it!
My husband and I got to vegas on thursday and we have been back to Mr. Mamas friday, saturday, sunday and now monday before our flight back to Los Angeles! The owner is super friendly and greets all of his customers and you can see how dedicated and detailed he is when running his business. His team is also friendly and speedy to get your food in by using  ipods to take in your order. Their coffee is delicious, I love their ham breakfast sandwiches on English muffin. Their crispy hashbrown is to die for! They serve these delicious thick cinnamon flavor french toast...Omg! Its making my mouth water just thinking about them! Also, their pancakes are spongy and yummy! We will be back!!!!
A great place off the strip. Veggie Omelette and breakfast burrito were wonderful. Good service and nice atmosphere.
Owner is super friendly & greets you at the door, he's got a great smile & you can tell the place is run efficiently. You can also tell when a place is good when it's in some random strip mall on a Tuesday morning and is packed with people. This particular morning was my birthday & I was there with my mom & sister. The wait wasn't horrible & we were taken care of well. Suddenly a big beautiful cinnamon bun came out to the table & I was told it was for my birthday :) Such a nice touch to the morning-it was the best cinnamon bun I've probably ever had too. The rest of the breakfast food was tasty & great portions as well. I can see why this place is rated so highly on here :)
Found Mr. Mama's on Yelp and went there in lieu of my usual Vegas brunch buffet. Mr. Mama's breakfast and coffee were excellent! I ordered the Denver omelet and it was the best I've ever had. I got it with a side of hash browns, which was good, but next time (and there will be a next time) I'll ask for the hash browns to be well done. . . The coffee was strong but not bitter, just the way I like it.. . Lastly, I wassuper impressed by the service. I usually don't expect much in terms of courtesy at a diner-style place like this, but they did good. Thanks Mr. Mama's! . . Oh, and did I mention that the prices are actually reasonable unlike so many places these days?
This is a true family owned restaurant.  This was my first time with my wife; we loved it!. . Food:  I ordered the chicken fried steak; the steak had a delicious greek seasoned batter, gravy was out of this world, and my scrambled were perfect.  The portions were very generous.  Love the greek influenced seasonings on almost everything...the gravy was the best!. . Service:  Fast, friendly, and accurate service and ordering.  My tea was always filled and food came out just as I ordered it.  Mr. Mama is very friendly; I like how he personally tries to greet and meet all his customers, it gives his place a real "home" feeling.  . . Price:  At only $4 for an order of home fries and a half order of the best biscuits and gravy this side of southern nevada; it can't be beat!  Everything was reasonably priced.. . Location:  Great use of a commercial strip mall location.  I wish they had a huge sign because it's not the easiest to find if you aren't familiar with the area.  I always shop at McFadden Dale Hardware so I knew exactly where this place was.. . ***Overall, this was a great first impression of a real Hometown Greek diner; love it.
There might be a long wait, or not, but it's worth the wait. This little gem of Vegas is worth the drive. Home-made flavors and reasonable prices. I recommend the biscuits and gravy, steak and eggs, the omelet that comes with feta cheese... yumm!! Can't wait to go back to Mr. Mama's.
Really love coming here. Food is so good.  Homemade at that! If you want breakfast or lunch I highly recommend it to you. The service is always good. Prices are not high. Might have a bit of a wait but it is worth it..
Ordering at a new place is always a risk b/c you never know if you're going to really enjoy the food.. . You won't regret it. It's reasonably priced, the food is delicious and the staff is generally friendly. What more could one ask for?
Love it, you can taste when people cook w love, and this has some much love, totaly coming back
Given the great reviews I had high expectations for Mr. Mama's.  They were not met.  It is clean and the staff is friendly but there is nothing exceptional about the breakfast other than the long wait to be seated.  The hash browns, omelette, and French toast were average and no where near as good as other reviewers described them.  I was surprised that they did not put out real butter.  If you want it be sure to ask.  . . The prices are reasonable and the food is not bad but I think that Mr. Mama's is living off the momentum of earlier popularity.
Loved the service here! From the greeter to our waitress Claudia, everything was top notch! My pancake was perfect, cooked but light & fluffy without me mentioning anything to the waitress. When we originally arrived, we were quoted a 50 min wait on a Monday morning but left because we were hungry. Went to Max Brenner (which closed yesterday apparently?) and returned about 30-40 mins later and had a 10-15 min wait. . . If your looking for a delicious, cheap eat provided by happy & wonderful staff, look no further! I would definitely eat here again if I'm in the area ;-)
Good food at cheap prices. The service is very good. The servers are extremely friendly & helpful.  I had the country fried steak with eggs and it was good.  The portions are big, so you can share one dish with two people depending on how much you eat.
