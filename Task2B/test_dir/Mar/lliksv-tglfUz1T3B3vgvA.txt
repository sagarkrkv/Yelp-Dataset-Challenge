Best place in town. Everything is so good! It's always busy, and the decor isn't great- through its huge! I would totally stop here if your in Vegas and are craving Thai- take it from a local!
BEST Thai Food I have tried since visiting Thailand! The food is extremely authentic and tastes amazing. I had the crispy rice as an appetizer.. it was an explosion of flavor in my mouth! Each individual piece of rice was packed with fresh lime, Thai chile, and cilantro. There was onions, tomatoes, and peanuts mixed in which put this dish over the top! I also got the Yellow Curry-medium spicy and it was very good. The serving size was perfect, and the flavor was great! The service is also great!
I stopped in my last trip to Vegas and ordered the crispy duck panang. It was amazing. This is now a staple of my Vegas trips although it is not on the strip. The stuffed chicken wings are fantastic and they have a great wine list. Well worth the trip every time.
+ yes it is pretty tasty. +servers are friendly and attentive. +im pretty sensitive to MSG but I felt okay after eating here.. -----. - it is expensive. . . Portions are ok but expect high end pricing for 8/10 food. . Nothing was to die for imo. . President's thai in east pasadena is more flavorful and cost 50% less. . . They have a lot of wines... in house cellar maybe?. . Parking is big. You have to go in  and park in the back where there is front door to the restaurant.  It appears to be a little run down outside. . . Went here after seminar... people at the seminar recommended.  . . Ill try something else next time.
The menu is huge! but the portions small and the price just not ok for Vegas especially for a Thai Restaurant. I guess the taste is OK, Unfortunately had better or I may have just ordered the wrong thing.. . Definitely make reservations. We waited for about an one hour cuz of the people rush from the outlets and you got people going in front you cuz they were smart...also weird from a regular thai restaurant. . Although they had a big menu it was a difficult to understand or I was just exhausted...but what's funny is that after going here...thai menus are so confusing..for one they actually put names in thai and describe the ingredients to you...but everything is almost the same.... . We ended up ordering four things, pad thai, minced ground chicken salad - i think that's what it was, and the wings...the people i went with didn't want soup so that took out a quarter of the menu. couldn't do the fried rice because we were getting white rice another quarter of the menu. got the pad thai can't do the other quarter of the noodles. There was the fish but it was market price (so expensive). We thought you know its thai big portions we were still hungry! so we asked for the menu again and it took so long for us to look and find we want and we just told the waiter what he recommended. We ended up getting something that was off the menu - chinese brocolli with fried pork and hoisin kind of sauce with garlic. Took forever though but it did the trick!
Wow, I was really disappointed. In my opinion this place is very overrated. I've had much better in Seattle, California and Ithaca (believe it or not). . . I asked for recommendations, and the waiter recommended drunken noodles, and duck panang curry. I was a little disappointed because the dishes sounded ordinary, and I felt like he may have assumed we were not adventurous by our appearances. I may go back and order dishes off the northern menu, or make it clear I'm adventurous. . . Anyway, off of recommendations online and from the waiter we got the garlic prawns, crispy rice, and duck with masaman curry. . . The crispy rice really didn't appeal to me. It tasted overwhelmingly of ginger and even had large strips of ginger in it. A little ginger goes a long way! It also had too much lemon grass. Eating it made my mouth fatigued and overwhelmed and not in a pleasant way at all. The sausage was really not good. The flavors just weren't balanced and the texture of the rice was good but not great. The pig skins in there were very good - I wish there had been more. . . The garlic prawns were really not good either. the shrimp meat was overcooked, but my main complaint was the flavor. The fried shrimp shells were very interesting and the texture was pleasing, but there was just no flavor in the dish at all besides black pepper and an oily fried food taste. Some kind of dipping sauce would have been ideal, but proper seasoning might have been enough to make it good. I keptdipping it in the red curry that came with but I would've preferred something acidic or sweet. Really ANYTHING to balance out the oily taste. It was served over slaw, but that was not dressed either - it was just there to catch the excess oil. . . The duck dish was very good. The duck was excellent, but I don't think it paired that well with masaman curry. I would order this again with a different sauce. It was silly of me to order the curry because, c'mon, you can get that kind of curry anwhere! But the curry tasted good. It didn't blow my mind, and I would've preferred if it wasn't broken. Overall, very disappointing. It wasn't worth the stomach ache of three deep fried dished, that's for sure! . . Also, yes it's easy to get a taxi there but how do you get back?? I had to wait an hour for a taxi to come get us after the meal and they had no idea where it was and couldn't find the restaurant.
I need to come back and try another entree.  This is a good Thai restaurant.   All the cab drivers know how to good to it and it was easy getting a cab back to the strip.  The shopping center is fine or average.
I came to this place after hearing great things and reading about how many world class chefs have ate there. Finally after visiting, I have to say that I am a bit disappointed with the food. The service was impeccable, and having worked in a higher end restaurant for several years, I could not find a single flaw. The food doesn't feel like it lives up to the standard of the service. I came a large group of people and we ordered the nine most popular dishes. And I mustsay that nothing about any of the food stood out.  I couldn't find a flaw with the taste or texture, but nothing about the food captured me. It was a bit of a let down, the food was still good, but everyone I was with felt the same way. Overall I would give it an 8.5 out of 10. If the food matched the service, it would be the best restaurant in the world.
THE BEST Thai food in Vegas, by far. I don't even feel the need to write more than that, but I will. . . Chef Saipin was gracious enough to greet me and wish me a happy birthday while me and my family dined here. Their staff made excellent suggestions as to what to get. Papaya salad, soft shell crab noodles, drunken noodles, pad thai, fried prawns, the soup... that could have been my last meal and I would've been fine with that.. . Don't let the location around the Lotus of Siam fool you. This place is well known for a reason.
This place is awesome!! . . Location:. Ghetto ass shopping center that if you go at night, looks pretty docile and empty everywhere else in that area.. . Food:. I had the Nam Kao Tod appetizer which was great. Good amount of food for an appetizer dish and it tasted amazing. I would order this again. For the entree I had this Pad See Ew noodle dish over grilled duck. Since I was with a bachelor party, I got to sample many noodle dishes with mine probably being the most popular. If you love duck & you love Pad See Ew, this is a MUST try! There are other duck dishes w noodles, but the Pad See Ew option was my favorite. . . Service:. We had a group of 12 or so and it worked out great. Service was fantastic and tended to us well. Everything came out in a timely manner too. I'd def recommend doing reservations here because it's that serious. If not, you'll be waiting a long time to eat.. . Overall:. One of the best Thai places I've eaten at. Def would go back to try what I haven't yet, and to get another noodle dish. Prices are fair and the menu is HUGE! That was the only tough part for me since I'm so indecisive. However, being in a large group and sharing everything, it made it easier that night. Cab here from the strip isn't that pricey at all!
I was in Vegas with my brothers a few weeks back. We wanted to try a place off the strip & had heard about LofS. We were starving but it's a quick cab ride from the northern end of Las Vegas Blvd. so we arrived in less than 5 minutes. Once inside, the short wait for our table naturally led us to their bar for beer & sake. . . Immediately after getting our drinks we were seated & ordered a bunch of food to share. It was so delicious that half way thru our meal we ordered more to take back to our room for the following day! Haha! . . The guys at the table next to us were regulars. They told us some really funny stories about the restaurant. And as they were leaving they gave us an expensive bottle of sake they hadn't opened. Score! It was soo smooth too! After our entrees we were full but had to order dessert. We ate like pigs! . . If you want to leave the strip for a few hours to relax in a different environment I really recommend LofS. The food is fantastic, the staff is very friendly, the mix of good people is diverse and it's all pretty inexpensive. I can't wait to go back!
Best Thai food in Vegas. Very fresh and a great menu selection. The wine cellar addition isn't half bad either!!! Always packed, and worth the wait!!!
Had the Squid salad and beef Chow Mien.  The squid salad was refreshing, very good.  The chow mien was good.  Not that much meat, but very good.
We ordered the crispy duck Panang curry and my oh my!!!!!! My tastebuds exploded into millions of joyful happiness! . . Tasty, crispy duck. Juicy as well. definitely true to the Thai Panang curry flavor. The serving however is a tad small. We licked the plate clean. Screw the stares! Lol.
Had lunch at the famous "lotus of siam" everyone talks about so I wanted to see it for myself... Ordered stuffed chicken wing . Chicken satay . Spicy fried rice with basil . Pad thai . And panang curry beef... All the dishes were okay.. not awesome.. The problem was at the curry.. As shown in the picture there were almost no curry in there.. 5 spoons at most and I told the server I don't see any curry in there and he said that's how it is... I ordered curry not beef with curry sauce... mediocre taste and expensive portions small... guess that's what happens when you make too much money and busy.. lose quality..
This place has really good Thai food, the service can be hit or miss but the food is almost always good! It's also pretty reasonably priced for what you get.
First time trying Thai and it was DELICIOUS! The options were vast and the customer service was wonderful! Glad I found something different off the strip!
So glad I trusted the 4 stars on 1600 reviews and experienced Lotus of Siam. After eating overpriced crap food everywhere on the strip, my palate and entire body was screaming with joy here.. . First off, what an interesting interior. The massive wine cellar and list is impressive. It still gave me a hole in the wall feel but it was a very large hole in the wall, unusually. The chandeliers were pretty to look at but it was hard to avoid the emergency exit sign/door that was next to my face from where we were seated. It didn't matter though, I was aching for some tummy comfort.. . Papaya salad, Musamun Curry and Salt & Pepper Prawns. Holy eff. It did more than the trick and I literally cried when the bear wouldn't let me eat the leftovers after we got back to the fridge-less hotel & they had been sitting out for a couple hours, I was aching for more of that deliciousness.... . I really wish I had gotten more chances to eat here and try some of their other specialties. Some of the best Thai I've had, ever.
I now understand what all the hype is about. The dishes that they do well are incredible, some of the other options where lack-luster, especially when you factor in the price. I have to say they gain at least a star on the wine list alone. Great selection and variety. I know for my palate I would stick with a white wine, but some of the more complex duck dishes would be a great excuse to try some of their red varietals.. . The staff here is kind,fast, and knowledgable. Every recommendation was spot-on. Dishes I will go back for include: . Drunken Noodles with Crispy Duck or Sea Bass. Salt and Pepper Prawns. Chinese Broccoli and Pork Belly. Soft Shell Crab Salad. . I was underwhelmed by:. The Beef and mint. Satay. Chili Basil Seared Scallops. Stir Fried Eggplant. . I'll have to go back with a different group and take advantage of the staffs suggestions.
My first visit, more than four years ago, was not remarkable by any means, but I decided to give Lotus of Siam a second chance.  Hallelujah that I did.. . Lotus of Siam has definitely expanded since my last visit, having taken over the space next door so that the location is now huge.  I worried upon arriving, resevation-less, on a Sunday at 5:30pm, opening time, and seeing guests lined up at the door, but once I set foot into the seating area, I could see that accommodating us, along with anyone behind us in line, was a non-issue.. . The menu, 15 pages with at least 10 offerings per page, can be overwhelming, so try to do your order research ahead of time.  The two of us went for the following, and boy did we hit our max:. . - Nam Kao Tod (4 stars): unlike anything I've eaten before.  Spicy, tangy, and citrus-y with crispy rice (love). - Roasted Duck Curry (3 stars): just your standard duck with red curry.  Passable, especially with other much more enticing options. - Sea Bass Drunken Noodle (5 very enthusiastic stars): at $29, definitely not inexpensive, but worth every deep-fried and wonderfully crisp, rich, and succulent sea bass bite.  Request mild if you can't handle spice because this delicious dish is packed with Thai chilis. - Mango Sticky Rice (4 stars): perfectly sweet and smooth mango coupled with coconutty sticky rice. . This was most certainly the best meal of my trip.  I am not much a fan of Vegas and have avoided the city for the past four years after countless previous trips, but now I am looking forward to returning if only to eat every meal at Lotus of Siam (of course with the Seabass Drunken Noodles).
Love the Northern Thailand pork dishes like pork stew and ground pork.  Curries, noodles and traditional dishes are well executed.  Worth a trip to the ghetto Commercial Center.  Coming  in between 1-2  is best to get in quickly.  Buffet is mediocre so go for the al a carte fare. The curry dishes, Thai style, is the best in town.. Expect a line on the weekends.
Spoiled rotten with my first time eating Thai food.. . From the outside, you will say "wow, really? This is what people are raving about?" in a sarcastic tone.  When you get your food, you will say, "wow, really! This what people are raving about!" enthusiastically.. . I am a very pedestrian eater when it comes to ethnic food. I don't like spicy, I don't like weird things.  So I was dreading my visit.  I was expecting to like 1 or 2 of the 10 things we ordered, in reality, there were only 2 of the 10 things I did NOT like (the spicy things)!. . Since I do not have a baseline, I will just say everything was great, so from a picky ethnic eater, here was what stood out:. . Mee Krob - interesting.  Just thought South Park made this word up.. Sea bass with Drunken Noodle - waiter recommendation over another sea bass pairing.. Crispy Duck with Panang - another waiter audible. Was spicy, but a great taste.. Pad Thai - again, interesting my unrefined palette. Mango Sweet Rice combined with Coconut Ice Cream - never had mango before, this was a treat! Definitely a great closer. Mango is only served in season. Wait for it.. . Finally, the Thai Iced Tea was really cool.  Warning, do not let this water down in the ice, it will destroy the epic flavor.. . By now, you should be reading this from the restaurant.  Just go!
The food was decent. Not the best. I've definitely have had better thai food. Overrated and overhyped. I read most of the yelp reviews with 3 or less stars and I agree with them. The portions are a little small.  My pad thai tasted like they burnt something in it which ruined the taste. Same with the moo yang. The yellow curry tasted okay. I did like the bamboo shoots with red curry sauce. Service was pretty good and fast. . . We went at night and there were a bunch of bums walking the parking lot asking for money. Not very comforting. . . Honestly I like komol way better which is just across the parking lot and their menu has pictures. Haha
They have gone down-hill since their expansion a couple of years ago.  I used to rate them 5-stars, now it is two.. . First the very positive: If you want the best and amazing flavors, this is the place.  They have their flavor profiles totally dialed in to perfection.. . Now, the problems... all of the proteins (meat, chicken, etc.) are too over cooked.  Bad texture and chewy.  The other problem is their "heat scale".   I have ordered food to be medium, and it can be all over the scale from barely spicy, to so intense it is inedible.. . The last experience we had last week delivered the flavors to perfection, but our proteins were way overcooked, and we had a salad that was inedible because it was extremely over-saturated with pepper heat, even though we ordered it medium.. . I had been going their for over 10 years.  Last week was my last time.  It is so sad.  I used to love this food.   Now I cannot eat it.
While being on the road to Vegas for a grueling ten hours, my cousins and I were very famished. I wanted a buffet, but majority ruled on getting something off the strip. Then my cousin suggested eating at one of his MUST EAT AT restaurants in Vegas, Lotus of Siam!. . We just got to the restaurant just in time before closing for dinner service. The hostess sat us quickly and hand us our menus. I wanted to try some of their popular menu items, but I had to hold back on them. Since it was the season of Lent, I had to avoid beef, pork, and fowl foods. Being in the city of sin, I decided to be good on a Friday. It was a hard decision for me, but I went with the pad see-ew.. . Our entrees were served withing a couple minutes. The pad see-ew was composed of stir-fried wide rice noodles, eggs, and Chinese broccoli all mixed with black soy sauce. Although the pad see-ew had egg in it, it was oneitem that I could have while observing Lent. The noodles were nice and chewy. The Chinese broccoli was crispy and fresh. The egg was in the scrambled form, but added the protein element to the dish. To complete the melody of the dish, the black soy sauce gave the right amount of saltiness. Just like one of my favorite dishes, Chow fun, I really did enjoy this dish.. . I do need to come back again and try the other popular dishes when in Vegas and not observing Lent.
Funny story, Lotus of Siam when you drive by from Sahara looks like a hole in the wall broken down place that you would never want to eat at.  On 2 different occassions I planned on going there and both times when I drove by we decided to go somewhere else. About a year ago we bit the bullet and decided to try it.  Surprisingly enough the front of the restaraunt is in the back and we were basically looking at the back of the place when driving by. It can be deceiving. I've been there 1/2 dozen times since. Last night we went and there was a 1 hour - 1.5 hour wait to get seated. The foods so good we waited over an hour. . . I've read reviews from more than one food critic calling is the best Thai Food in all of North America and I believe they are right. I've been to Thailand for a month to train and the food is actually better at Lotus of Siam! The owner apparently started cooking in Thailand at age 5 with her mother/grandmother and brough that experience to Vegas.  Just yesterday I saw on Yahoo that Lotus of Siam was #89 on the list of the best 101 restaraunts in the USA. . . As for the food, some things I recommened for an appetizer are the Prawns in a blanket, spicy chilli chicken wings and also the Tom Kah Kai Soup.  For dessert the Mango Sticky Rice is the bomb plus it is way healthier than eating cake or ice cream! . . Iwent with 3 people total and for our main courses to split we got Crispy garlic prawns, Panang Curry and Sea bass over drunken noodles.  I've had numerous dishes here and they are all good.  All the curries are great, the pad thai, the crispy duck. Great flavors and taste you wont find many other places.  I see myself going back very soon!. . Follow me on twitter/instagram @MikeCies
Holy crap this place is good. Eat the crispy duck drunken noodle and achieve ultimate happiness. Don't let the exterior fool you - this place is badass
best Thai food I've ever had in my whole life!!!!!. . my bf and I went here during our spring break trip to Vegas. he heard of this restaurant from a Foodie friend and really wanna take me here. I was not very impressed during our first visit as the restaurant is located in a shady, shady, shady neighborhood. we arrived there at 3pm that afternoon only to find that the restaurant only open for lunch 11ish to 2:30 and dinner starting from 5:30pm. so at that moment I felt somewhat relieved.. . the next day we were looking for places to have a quick dinner before heading to the airport. as I was curious how this restaurant was able to deserve such a good review on Yelp, I proposed we try this place! we arrived exactly at 5:30, hoping to get in immediately when it opens. and guess what? there was already a very long waiting line in front of the restaurant! definitely a good sign! . . as soon as we were able to get into the restaurant, a waiter comes to us with a charming smile asking if we had a reservation or not. (so apparently they take reservations and can be overly booked) we expressed our need to catch a flight and the waiter was very kind in finding a seat for us as quickly as possible. when we sat down and started to checking out the interior of the restaurant, we realized where the  owner have spent all her money. the interior decoration looks like a fancy, high-class dining room with chandeliers, hard wood tables and chairs, mirror-like clean floors and a huge wine collection!. . it's quite unfortunate we were not able to try the wine due to time constraints and we only had one dish as neither me nor my bf was hungry. we tried the crisp duck curry  as recommended and it turns out to be really really great! the duck was crispy outside, juicy inside and when the curry swims in your mouth, you would want to bite your tongue off! I also ordered a Thai ice tea and it doesn't fail to surprise me either!. . btw, the waiter is very tentative and knows what dish to get!. . well, enough has been said. this is a much try in Vegas!
I'm going to say 5 stars for the crispy rice dish, and 2 stars for the jack fruit curry (it was interesting, but really not what I wanted), 3 stars for the drunken noodles, and 4 stars for the crispy duck on top of the noodles... It's a wash. . . Reservations are highly recommended! I made reservations for 2 a few weeks in advance, and they actually said that my first choice for time was unavailable. When i got the restaurant, a few parties of 2 walked in and were told that the wait was 45 minutes (!?). . . The service was prompt and the menu is overwhelming! I liked that they have Isaan food. However, I think that I may have ordered the wrong thing...I was intrigued by the jack fruit curry, but it was ok...It was really watery and more like tomato water with herbs :( The drunken noodles were ok. Thecrispy duck on top was really good, though, which sort of made the dish, but the noodles on their own were average. . . I do have to say that the crispy rice dish, though, was FANTASTIC! Very flavorful, in all the right ways. . . They say that it's spicy. I got a 3 (out of 10). I can handle spicy food, but they warned us that 3 or 4 packed a lot of heat. The crispy rice was spicy, but the drunken noodles and jack fruit curry could have had a bit more spiciness.
I went to this strip-mall restaurant based on Yelp reviews, and they were right. This is one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to, and I'm a big fan of Thai. The crispy rice appetizer was completely new to me and really remarkable. All four people in my party loved their entrees as well.  The only down side of this restaurant is getting there - you really have to have a car to get there. The place looks like nothing from the outside, but we arrived 15 minutes before they opened for the evening and there was already a line to get it.
Great place to find wonderful Thai food. We had the pad Thai and garlic prawns with drunk noodles! Also had the Tom Kah Kai soup and egg rolls. Delicious, and the bill was only $53!
The food here is good, but i have to admit i was a bit disappointed. Everyone kept saying this is the best thai food they have ever had, so i had to try it. The food was a bit dry and didn't taste fresh. I understand the place is always packed, we waited over an hour for a table, but the food needs to be fresh. I just feel like if you wait for so long the food needs to be amazing. It was definitely good, but in my opinion not worth that wait. Have to say this place is really overrated. But try it for yourself, and see what you think.
