Great food, service and overall good time.
Awesome food and Tony &.  Karen are the friendliest folks ever - what an amazing menu.service is always outstanding 9th check in here. Come hungry - love the Diavola pizza .. Actually never had a bad meal!! Ciao Bella
Cibo = Yumminess!!  Plain and simple!!  the ambiance is awesome and the food doesn't disappoint!!  I've always received great service here, and the staff is great at suggesting items that I probably wouldn't have tried, but will reorder again and again!  The patio is awesome!  Take advantage of it while you still can :)
Not really necessary to add to the compliments but why not if they deserve it. Food was phenomenal. Really. It was. Best pizza I had in a long time (ever?), and my husband shared that sentiment. Grilled veggie appetizer was very good too. Next day we went back (not our M.O. in a city where we only have 2 days) and got pizza and desert, crepes. Hmmm. Only complaint we had is the first day, the service was really rushed. Girl wanted to take our plate while there was still some olives on it, and when she brought us the check, while she was thanking us she was already turned away to the next table. A few extra seconds go a long way here, I'd say. Also, they "switched out"  some beers without telling us when we ordered, which I didn't like. Service next day was better and all in all, I'd very much recommend the place!
Cibo...where do I even start? Hands down the best pizzeria in Phoenix, and remains as the best pizza I've ever had. I've had nothing but great experiences with Cibo, everything I've ordered here has been amazing. The staff and owner are really friendly as well. My personal favorite pizza is the Tartufata, so good! I also really enjoy their patio and outdoor seating, looks awesome at night when all the lights are lit up.
This place has the best to offer eh? meh.   . . Date night around 8pm on a Saturday?. 1) waited 10 minutes at the bar for a beer that was served half cold. Meh. . 2) lady has a pesto salad, could not taste the pesto and nuts very well. Meh. . 3) I had the genova pizza which left a lot to be desired. Overwhelmed by too much cheese and an over-olive-oiled crust, I barely tasted the potato. Meh.. 4) banana nutella crepe was excellent however. . 5) service? Again, meh. Not terrible, not great. . . If you come in with 3* hopes, you will get a 3* return, maybe 4* if they are not going during peak hours
I've been to Cibo numerous times, and I feel it's losing a bit of its footing as one of the best pizzas in the valley. The crust on the pizza came out dry and half of it was burnt black around the edges. Also I've always wanted to have dessert but never had room until last night. I was excited to try the Nutella and marscapone crepe....what an utter disappointment! There was barely a full teaspoon of Nutella and I couldn't even find the marscapone. I literally felt like I ate a plain crepe.  If you want a fantastic pizza with little wait, check out Lamp in N. Scottsdale...you won't be disappointed!! So much better!!
Tasty town
All I have to say is awesome. Our waitress was friendly, the food was great and the atmosphere was perfect. Downtown Phoenix has the best little places to eat at!
Our new favorite find on yelp!  Amazing food, great little place, will be back every time we go downtown for an event. The pizza and desserts were the BEST. Loved everything about this place, a must try restaurant.
Great place for lunch. Meatball sandwich is my fav! I have not had pizza there- I think it is served for dinner only, but I hear it is good. Cozy atmosphere for dining inside or out. Minus one star for lack of parking.
My daughter and I had dinner at Cibo before a show.  They were unexpectedly slammed.  Our waitress Christina was really fabulous.  Calm and gracious. The food was, as always, wonderful.  Wish it was closer to my house in Scottsdale!
Ok, this is making my pizza at lunch choice difficult.  I love POMO on 1st street and am beginning to like La Piazza Locale also on 1st St. so adding this one into the miix is not helping.  . . Where Cibo wins out is in dinning atmosphere, it is in a house and has a wonderful garden/patio area.  Nice feel.  . . It is a small walk from downtoan but I would not recommend making the hike in the summer as I did last year.  Too long and too hot for the same quality pizza that you can get closer to downtown.. . Very nice thin crust pizza, napoli style.  Nice salad and sandwihich options also.
Cibo is absolutely fantastic!!!. . The patio is the perfect spot to enjoy their authentic pizza.  Have the quatro frommagio... it is the best I've ever had!  Love the fact that the owners are there most nights, and the staff are really fun and friendly.
Love the urban ambience, great wine list, but the salad and sandwich menu is to die for. I've visited this place many times over the past 5 years and the quality of their food and service remains consistently outstanding.
Cibo itself is a oxymoron. Very cozy but large. Very romantic but busy. I will explain that later. This Italian restaurant is that but much more. On the corner of North 5th Avenue and West Filmore. At night, you will see a house lit up with strings of white lights and the sound of a guitar playing sweet melodies. . Getting there was a small challenge for me. Not being from Phoenixand not being familiar with side streets. My main route was using the freeway. Which I am not a particular fan of. . This night, Friday, was filled with a lot of ambulances, cop cars and fire trucks with lights and sirens blazing. One incident, my wife counted around 12 of these emergency vehicles going the other way on the freeway at the same time. I just pray that they all got there on time to help the people who were in need.. Getting closer to the restaurant. You can see the tall buildings of downtown. We were following the maps app but a lot of the streets are not well lit. So we missed a street or two. Luckily we did find the restaurant. Again the strings of white lights and the guitar music were a good indicator that we were here. Plenty of parking on West Filmore street.. Besides the front patio dining. They have a small bar once your inside. The bar itself holds, at most, 9 individuals. A good selection of bottled beers, wine and shots of different cocktails. My wife tried a limoncello drink that she thought was real good. Too bad she got the last one so she couldn't order another.. What makes this restaurant cozy but large is the inside of the restaurant is broken up into smaller rooms. So you never see everyone who is dining there. You can just focus on your present company and the meal you are sharing. This also explains the being romantic and busy part. Waiting for your table you see servers and patrons going back and forth. It's not until you get seated into one of those smaller rooms that everything starts to slow down.. The crowd that eats there is a very diverse crowd. From hipster guys and gals to men in suit and ties and women in dresses. Young and old come here.. And they come for the atmosphere but mainly for the food. Great Italian fare. Pizzas, pasta dishes, colorful salads. The food is amazing. House chop salad is great, 3 pairs of different prepared bruschetta is great and the bolognese sausage dish that I had was so good. It was all delicious. If you come here. You will not be disappointed.
Overpriced. Tiny dishes.. Food was cold. Avoid at all costs.
Well the big fuss was overrated, however it is an ok place to dine with friends. The crust nothing to brag about but it's home made ,very nice.  The Orr of the place is a winner . Loved the  verify of dish to choose from. Will recommend to others just not Ooooo a must gotta go there recommendation .
I went here for dinner by myself. I went on a Friday night at 8. I had to wait maybe 20 minutes,  but it went quickly. I can tell this is a place I would come to often with my husband if we lived here, but I'm from indiana. I ordered a root beer and margharita pizza. It was ready really fast. It came to the table very hot and topped with huge basil leaves. The cheese was sparse-the way it should be. The cheese and sauce were of excellent quality.  The crust left something to be desired so I didn't eat the edges. It tasted like toast. Not bad, just not ideal. My bill was $14.50. I would definitely go back.. . A side note/caution: don't walk there by yourself. It is not a well lit area and there were a few times I thought I should not be alone. This however, should not reflect poorly on the establishment.
Fruit crepes and peach belinis on a sunny patio, while the guitar is strummed lightly in the corner. Awesome atmosphere.
One of my favorite places to eat in downtown phoenix. Their patio is very cute - I would definitely recommended sitting outside when the weather is nice. . Everything we ordered was very good - there were 4 of us and we ordered a few things to share: . . Pear salad - an arugula salad with balsamic, pears, honey, cheese, and toasted almonds - Very good, would definitely recommend! . . Burrata - creamy mozzarella with a balsamic glaze served with prosciutto and toast  - so good but not enough toast in the cheese-to-bread ratio! . . Vegetariana pizza - a pizza with mozzarella, artichokes, zucchini, roasted red peppers - comes with mushrooms but we asked for it without. This was good but the veggies are separated by section - so you only get one type of veggie on a slice of pizza, rather than having it mixed. . . Prosciutto Crudo pizza - sauce, mozzarella, topped with prosciutto. Very tasty but the pizza is cut before the prosciutto is added to the pizza, so you have to recut it to avoid ending up with all the prosciutto on one piece. . . Pizza is good - very thin crust and all the ingredients seem very fresh. . . Service was pretty good - although they must have been training when we were there, they seemed to get the tables confused and kept attempting to drop off items we hadn't ordered. But normally the service is great. I'll definitely be back!
My favorite pizza place (Pizzeria Bianco is great, but this place is better). I live in Gilbert so it is kind of far, and yet I still make a trip out as often as I can. Have brought multiple friends to show them the goodness that Cibo is and we are never let down. Great atmosphere, live music outside. The Diavola is my favorite. Complete it off with dessert (Nutella and Banana) and you'll be in food heaven. Two suggestions: turn the music down on the inside and have a better hostess bar (every time we walk up to be seated they seem confused)
Great Pizzas and a phenomenal cous cous salad! Good service and a cool outdoor patio. It is located inside a converted house, which makes it very homey and comfortable.
Great pizza and I love the beer selection. It's a super cute place that is perfect for a first date. The pizza sizes are generous as I could have easily shared mine with a friend. Parking can be difficult during peak dining times, but as long as you are willing to drive around a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.
After reading so many good reviews I was excited to try Cibo. To me it just didn't live up to the hype. However, the patio was perfect for an afternoon lunch in the shade. I had the Salsiccia Saltimbocca Caldi which was good but VERY greasy. I'd definitely try it again next time I'm in Phoenix!
So good! Worth the wait for a table. Definitely recommend you arrive early before 7 p.m.
Great food, terrible service! We made a reservation for a graduation dinner and there were 10 of us. Our server had two other large parties and could not get out of her own way. As a previous server, I know this can be overwhelming, but we had to get up and ask to order our food and drinks and to have the table cleared all night.
