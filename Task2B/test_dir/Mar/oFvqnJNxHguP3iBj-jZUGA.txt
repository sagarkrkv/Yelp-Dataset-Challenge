Living in Las Vegas, I don't go to the Strip often. But every time I do, I try not to miss the fountain show. Usually hang around for an hour or so to watch 3-4 different compositions. Always a delightful experience!
This should be on everyone's mandatory to-do list! I went when I was much younger but it's even more amazing than I remember. . . I would describe it to a stranger as "water fireworks," especially if you see them at night. Lots of music, lights, loud thumping. . . We first saw them really late one night and the show was brief and not so good. Go during really busy hours because that's when they really put on a show that's worth it. I'd say right after sunset would be a great time. . . There aren't any benches, so try to go when you're not exhausted! Lots of great places for drinks across the street though.
This is something that you have to see at night, and frankly, it doesn't hurt to have a couple of drinks in you to really be swept away by the music and the show. These fountains are quite spectacular, and very interesting.. . The music is one of the best parts and dances along with the fountains. The lights, the color, the music, and the people all add to the experience, and this is yet another Las Vegas 'Don't Miss.'
We've been going to Vegas for years.  The Fountains of Bellagio never get old.. . You just cannot walk past without watching the water and wondering at the engineering that can time the water dance so precisely. . . Nothing more to add.
"What is the ritual again? Water from the fountain and a mermaid's tear?" -- Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011). . Having made a few trips to Las Vegas over the years, the fountains are always a fun and touristy thing to do.  This time out I would have been fine skipping this particular event, but a couple of gals in my group had never seen it in person, so off we went.. . Having walked the entire strip a few times already during our trip, the decision was made to cab it there - only $15 with tip from our hotel (Mandalay Bay).  Not too bad for a Sunday night.  When we got there, the bellman told us 3 minutes til showtime.  Off we went and it was already crowded - so we were stuck towards the back side towards the front of the hotel - but we still had a good view.. . This is where disappointment sets in - the show seems so much shorter than it has been in years past.  Maybe 2 minutes long?  And the song was nothing I had ever heard before - something classical and not recognizable.  My past trips have been Frank Sinatra (very Vegas) and Tony Bennett (also very Vegas).  While the waterworks are impressive, it is time to update it and make sure even the music is WOW.  And believe me, I love classical music too.. . Overall, I think it was lackluster.  Time to upgrade, Bellagio.  Or at least make sure the music is snazzier to go with the Vegas atmosphere.  Otherwise it was just OK...unless you were 80 (which the crowd coming in after us was).
how can anyone hate on this?. . they play every 15 or 30 minutes. . its very pretty and free to watch. it does get crowded sometimes at night but its still worth it, see it at least once.. . watch out for the people asking more money on the sidewalks though
It was my first trip to Las Vegas, and I was definitely down to see these fountains. All I could think of was Oceans Eleven.. . We rode over to catch the 9 or 915ish "showing" on a Sunday night. Christ, there were a sh!t ton of people there. We got a decent view closer to the hotel side rather than the street view. I don't know how long it went on, but I think I was pretty impressed... after all the drinks I had drank that day. And evening. . . Maybe my memory is skewed, but the majority of people seeing this thing are drunk, right?  So, it's probably not a big deal what it looks like.  Anyway, I'm giving it 4 stars, but I'd probably go for 3.5 if I could. I was really excited about it, but it was probably not as magical as I had thought.. . STILL I think it's worth seeing if you're there. :)  It's definitely one of the prettier, less smelly parts of Vegas.
Best outdoor fountains in Vegas by far! The only ones too, at least as far as I know.
It's a must if you've never seen it before.  . . I think the show is every 30 or 15 mins depending on the time of day and the music usually different.  They did a spectacular job in designing and developing it and in maintaining.  Its a wonderful attraction that is FREE!. . However, there are several special spots to see it... making it no longer free, but some are well worth it.  Several of the restaurants have some great views.  You can sit on the patio at Yellowtail (hard to get a reservation, but awesome if you have a large party.. or try to request the table next to the window) or see it at several restaurant like Scarpetta and Paris.  However, you won't hear the music but you also don't have to stand outside with everyone else.
I could watch this run all day.. . Each show is different, as is each song. The night shows are spectacular. I only wish that the speakers pumped out more volume. It's a little difficult to hear them when 10 people are standing in front of each one, acting as a sound buffer.. . They should also post signs about personal etiquette. Some douchnoggle behind me kept bumping the back of my head with his tablet as he reached above me to take video of the show. Others just push their way in. It's a good thing I have elbows and aren't afraid to use them.
love watching the fountain shows! . so much work goes into it, and it's always amazing! . seen it a few times now, and will definitely be back. . . A must see when you come to Vegas!
A free show in Vegas. Gets no better than that. I had to look up the times the fountain show was suppose to start but once we got that down, my goodness. During the slow season the shows are every 30 minutes from 3 to 7 pm and then every 15 minutes after that. To know that every show is different is spectacular. People crowd in the best locations to get great pictures so get there right after a show ends to get a great spot. I enjoyed this.
Water shows are like every 30 minutes the only thing that you may not like is that there are a lot of people "performing" on the strip here and there's a lot of walking traffic here.
I make a point to visit this 1-2 times every time I'm in Vegas. It is fun, and honestly a lot cooler in person than on video or TV.. . Highly recommend going and maybe staying for a couple songs. And best of all, it is free!
This is the best free attraction I have seen anywhere. I think I have seen them 4 times so far during my stay, and plan on watching a few more night time shows. All shows are different. I did see one afternoon show that was not as impressive as others, but on the whole...these are phenomenal! They go at the top of the hour and sometimes on the half. Definitely stop and watch!
When people say not to miss this you should listen to them! This is easily the best free show in Vegas (just a little better than the child street performers in old Vegas!). . . It became the running joke because the first time we came to see the fountain show it was cancelled because of high winds. . . The second time we went it was 1pm and a voice came on and said "The first show will start at 3pm". Come on!. . Third time was the charm, we'll kinda. We got there 10 minutes until 11 pm and he show had already started so we saw the last two minutes and let me tell you the show as beautiful!. . Minus two starts for the inconsistency and plus one for the actual show being great!
