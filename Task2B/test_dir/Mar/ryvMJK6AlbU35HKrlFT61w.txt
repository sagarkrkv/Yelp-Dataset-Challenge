Simply delicious, Everytime I go to Vegas, I stop by here to get my meat fest on
The best food and service. The lamb is to die for and the lobster bisque is delicious. I am never disappointed. Although the prices for the drinks and high the food is worth it.
First thing, if you are planning to eat here make sure to sign up for their rewards club.  You'll get an of instant coupon for $25 off (sometimes it changes) and future offers for discounted meals.  The buffet at dinner time is 50 dollars for all you can eat.. . The actual buffet area has quite a few nice items.  I try not to fill up on too many of them so I can get my moneys worth on meat, but there is definitely room for some nice cheese and a few sauteed mushrooms, which go great with the meats I might add.. . My personal favorite meats are the Beef Rib, Filet (rare of course), and lamb chop.  The Lamb Leg was the only thing I didn't particularly like as it was a bit too gamy for my tastes.  If you want to request something specific you can ask your waiter and he will normally help you out.  . . On that note the only real trick I have about coming here is to try to make a reservation about 30 minutes before closing.  This still gives you plenty of time to eat as the kitchen still produces food for 30 or more minutes after closing, but things are settling down so you have much more chance to just ask anyone around to get you whatever you would like.  I've been 3 times and the 2 times I went towards the end of the night the meal was significantly more enjoyable.
Oh holy cow!! This place is the best. Better than Fogo IMHO.  Went here to celebrate my new job with my husband. The cold bar was delicious, though I didn't love the roasted garlic as it wasn't soft as I had hoped. The meat was top notch, as expected.  The top sirloin, first cut, is the best.  The beef rib was soft, flavorful, and had just enough fat and salt to be perfect!!!  The service was also fantastic.  We will be back when we are there next.
i came here a while ago with my brother and his girlfriend and we left stuffed to the top! this place is amazing. they have people come around with different meat selections and make you want to try everything! i had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse so they explained it all to me. you get a card with red and green sides. of course red means stop and green means GO!!!! you get to make your way to the salad bar which has a variety of different salads and bread and cheese and cold meats.. then the fun begins. when you turn your card over to green one at a time a server will bring delicious meat to your table. they cut it right in front of you or just drop it on your place. AMAZING. they have waiters, of course, that come and check on you and fill your drinks but they don't to the greatness the servers do. :) it was a really fun and delicious experience.
Excellent meats.  If you want lower quality meats like flank steak, they have that but it's not as good at the minion or lamb.  the lamb chops were perfect.  The leg of lamb was a little gamey.  service was great.  as fast as you could shovel it in your mouth is how fast they had another piece of me sitting on your plate.
Great meat and great food! Ambience is awesome! .  It was my daughter's 20th birthday when we went there and we told them. They were sweet enough to bring us a "happy birthday" slice of cheesecake with a candle when we were done BUT when we got the bill, the cheesecake that they served was in the bill! I did not even know how to react to that..why serve us a cheesecake that we did not order and then charge us for it? . But the food here is so delish!!
The food here is tasty and unusual, but I would have a hard time saying it was gourmet.  Certainly there is quantity, but I would argue that the quality is less than perfect.  Of the meats, I'd suggest the chicken/bacon combo was the best, while the others were hit and miss.  The salad bar was remarkable insofar as salad bars are concerned, with offerings both unusual and creative:  buffalo mozerella, marinated onions, grilled mushrooms, salmon, and lobster bisque.  We were here with a large group and the format worked well for our food, but our drinks were tardy and ill prepared.
The food was absolutely amazing. The salad bar has anything you could ever want to put in a salad, and then some. To highlight: a handful of different kinds of lettuces, cold cuts, cheese, sauteed and steamed veggies, shrimp, and more. Once you're back at your table, they bring you mashed potatoes, cinnamon sugar bananas, and Pao de Queijo (which is awesome cheesebread). Now on to the meat. Servers walk around with 15 kinds of meat on skewers, all of which are cooked perfectly. Our favorite were the sirloin, flank steak, lamb, and filet mignon, but they also had lamb chops, sausage, Parmesan-crusted pork, and bacon wrapped chicken and filet mignon. As for drinks, I recommend the red sangria. It's a little sweet, but still really good. . . It's pricey (what isn't in Vegas...), but totally worth it. You have to make a reservation, but I highly recommend trying this place.
Very good food;  excellent service. The salad and side bar is full of fresh and unique items. The meats are very good-tender and flavorful. The flank steak is the most flavorful and is my favorite. The bacon-wrapped filet melts in your mouth. Our service was excellent-drinks always full, server made sure to send over the meats we were waiting for. Overall a very nice dining experience.
This was our 3rd time to this restaurant and we were supremely let down and won't return to this location.. . We've been to 3 locations, Yonkers, Aruba and Las Vegas, all multiple times. This most recent experience was very disappointing. . . The main two downfalls were the service and food quality. . . 1. Service: The entire meal felt very rushed, especially for 6pm on a Wednesday.  For us, it's all about the experience; eating good food and staying out of the casinos! Unfortunately, the servers rapidly kept coming to our table, and one was in such a rush, he whipped the lamb around so fast that we had pieces of meat and au ju on our table for the remainder of the night. Also, one time around, instead of thin slices of flank steak, the server cut off a huge hunk of meat and it took up a majority of my husband's plate, not very appetizing! The waiter seemed very overwhelmed, unwelcoming, and barely paid our table any attention. . . 2. Food quality: on our visit, we experienced dry pork tenderloin, tough flank steak (those are the main two that stand out). The best cut of meat was the top sirloin,  however, it was very salty. . . Why 2 stars you ask? Because their sangria is phenomenal!!  . . A visit to Texas de Brazil is often the highlight of our trip, and worth the cab fare from the Strip to get there. Regrettably, for us, that is no longer the case. Save yourself time and can fare and visit a steakhouse on the strip.
I love this place but be careful you WILL overeat! Also, making reservations is better than not! And eat the meat and not the salad bar or you won't get your money's worth!
Great food. Great atmosphere. The Salad Bar is great but the Service is Rushed, maybe to clear the tables because they are so busy. If they Slow the rush so that I could give this great restaurant 5 stars.
Salad bar is good. Meat sweats garun-teed! The staff is very good and make sure that youi have everything that you need. Don't fill up on the salad bar before the meat train pulls into the station.
