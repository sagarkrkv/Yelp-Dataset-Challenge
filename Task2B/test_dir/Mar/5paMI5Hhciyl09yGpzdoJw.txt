Wonderful suites, connected rooms, clean, modern. Very nice.
I absolutely love the Palazzo.  . . It is one of the nicer hotels on the strip, at least in my opinion.  It is so convenient and the pools are so much fun not to mention the fact that it is also connected to the Venetian.  So it is like you are getting two hotels in one.  . . They have several pools on site and also Tao day club, which is not all that great, way too crowded.  Like I mentioned before the Palazzo and Venetian are connected so if the Palazzo pool is too crowded you can always just walk over to Venetians pool or vice versa.  . . My group and I stayed at the Bella Queen suite, check in was a breeze.  It was fairly quick and we were given a coupon booklet and some offers for the day club that they have there.  . . I love the rooms there.  They are incredibly spacious and the beds are very comfortable.  The room is split up into three parts.  There is the bathroom which is accessible through double doors on your left when you first walk into the room.  Then you have the beds area, which has two queen beds a little mini fridge in front if the beds.  Fair warning, they do not allow you to put your own things in the fridge and charge you if you remove what they have inside.  There is a sensor that notifies them if you remove the products inside the fridge.  There is a flat screen tv above the mini fridge area in front of the beds.  . . The last part is the sunken living room which is a few steps down from the beds area.  There is another tv there along with a L-shaped couch that folds out into a pull out bed and also a business area with a phone and a printer.  . . My favorite aspect of the room though is the bathroom.  Ladies, the Palazzo Bella suite bathrooms are the best bathrooms to get ready in.  They are huge, we managed to fit 5 girls getting ready, pretty comfortably in the bathroom and the best part is there are mirrors everywhere in the bathroom.  They have a mirror above the bathtub.  A full mirror that runs the length of the bathroom where the sinks are and also a nice little vanity with a chair by the doors to the bathroom.  The best bathroom ever to get ready in, mirrors everywhere, awesome lighting and so much room to unload all the makeup, fake lashes, hair extensions, curling irons, hair spray and all that good stuff.  . . 5 stars well deserved!
I'm a gold Grazie member so I've been here several times. My husband and I planned a trip to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. We married at The Venetian so naturally we wanted to stay there or Palazzo. . . I usually get a pretty good hotel rate as a gold member. But because there was some big convention at the hotel during our dates, they didn't offer me any kind of discount. Ok, fine. So I emailed guest services and asked for a suite upgrade and explained our reason for our visit. I even said I don't care about the view. I have done this in the past. Usually just for small requests such as a high floor or to put a humidifier in the room. They have my history and know I don't ask for a lot. I just wanted something special for our anniversary. I was told it wasn't possible. And they didn't even offer anything else as an alternative such as a free upgrade to Prestige or hotel credit. There are tons of things they could have done if they really wanted to. . . And this is in the middle of their website hacking incident so I'm getting a little nervous about the fact that it took them a week to get only a basic shell of their website back up. And I'm getting more and more irritated by the lacking customer service.. . So I'm paying full price for the basic suite and as a gold Grazie member who has been a loyal customer for 10 years and they can't be bothered to give me the time of day.. . I searched around online and for the same price that I was being charged at Palazzo, I found a much bigger and nicer suite at Bellagio. I wrote their guest relations department and explained the purpose of my visit and admitted that I was a longtime Palazzo/Venetian customer. They responded to all of my requests quickly, within hours. They put us in a beautiful suite. It was 1,000 sq feet and had 2 full baths in the bedroom plus the living room had a powder room. I couldn't believe it was the same price for what I had booked at Palazzo.. . Our stay at the Bellagio was amazing. It made me see how the service has really slipped at Palazzo/Venetian. The room service breakfast arrived when they said it would. Food was hot and really, really good (try the pancakes). The housekeepers came by twice a day yet it seemed like we never saw them and their carts in the hallways. The suite was immaculate!! You didn't see dirty plates sitting in the hallway. When we requested new pillows, they were delivered immediately. The light went out in the makeup mirror in my bathroom and it was replaced right away. These are things that are sadly missing at Palazzo/Venetian.. . I'm sad to say that I don't understand how they keep their 5 star rating. And I never thought I would consider staying anywhere else. But I seriously doubt I will be staying there again. They really need to get back to the way they used to be. Thanks to their lousy customer service and insanely high prices, I found a new place to stay in Vegas that truly is a 5 star hotel.
The Palazzo is a beautiful resort with amazing suite rooms.. . The rooms are very very spacious and decorated very nice!. The pool was closed when I was there, so I was not able to check that out.. . The hotel is VERY VERY clean and the smoke-free sections are very nice.. Be prepared to spend here - the "cafe" for breakfast can easily run you $50 for two people.. . Overall - I def would recommend the Palazzo to someone looking for a classy stay in vegas with a higher budget.
I absolutely LOVE this hotel! . . Staying here for a week long work conference and so far it's been wonderful! . The suite itself is elegant, clean and has a modern home feel to it. . . The rooms are equipped with double beds, two televisions, a small fridge stacked with drinks which of course are not included. The room has two steps from the bed to the window. The couch, desk, coffee table and second television are located bottom of the steps near the window. . . The restrooms are adorable with a shower stall, and good sized bathtub that I would definitely be using if I had time lol. . . . I love how they supply two bathrobes! . . I am definitely coming back here.
This is my favorite hotel. I've stayed here multiple times because they are reasonably priced compared to other hotels on the strip, conveniently located & have tons of places to shop & dine. The best part are the size of the rooms-a room with 2 queen beds and a living room with a L-shaped couch can fit up to 6 people. The bathroom is large enough for a bunch of girls to get ready in at once. Also like to to mention that there are a plethora of mirrors & outlets which is so great! (I once had to do my hair using my reflection in the window when I stayed in Planet Hollywood, ugh never again). Also right across the street from Fashion Show mall, just take the walkway. Oh and try the restaurant Cut while you're there too.. . I've recently stayed in Aria, Luxor, Excalibur & Treasure Island...... Palazzo still remains my fav. I would definitely recommend staying here!
The rooms at the Palazzo are quite luxurious and spacious. The bathroom is huge. Comfortable bed - although the pillows are somewhat small. Internet service is fast & reliable (which is becoming rare in hotels). The coach in the tv area is huge and comfortable. The casino is practically smokeless. You can spent the entire night there and your clothes won't smell like smoke. Decent eats. Overall great experience.
The Palazzo is really nice on the outside and pretty nice on the inside. There is a waterfall, some nice displays and access to the shopping mall that the Palazzo shares with the Venetian. I just didn't find the palazzo special in any way. It seems to be a kind of convention hotel where the rooms and hotel are setup to support conventioneers attending conferences. I didn't think that any if the restaurants we visited (especially Morels) were very good, but all of the restaurants were outrageously priced (see my reviews).  I did not try all of the restaurants to be fair but the ones I did try were expensive and not really great. Nothing bad to say here, but nothing really good either.  Not a bad place to stay if your here for business, but if you're looking for special treatment, I'd look elsewhere.
There is no other hotel better than Palazzo.  I live in LA and going to Vegas for 25 years and have tried every hotel - mostly the higher end ones and have fallen in love with this one for many reasons.  For what you get, it's the best deal in town.  Super spacious rooms - great for big groups, very clean and high class feel.  Love the pools and Azure pool cub especially rocks!  The service all around is superb - whether you're at the pool, spa, gambling, restaurants - the people that run this hotel are top-notch when it comes to customer service.  The prestige level is worth the extra money.  A sweet breakfast spread and great lounge/bar environment where you can chill and regroup.  It's a memorable experience going to this hotel.  You really shouldn't have to leave, unless for a show, because the restaurants are amazing - tried BOUCHON and SUSHI SAMBA last weekend ....  both amazing and exceed expectation.  Fois gras at Bouchon is orgasmic.  I also love the location being connected to the Wynn and Encore.  I've stayed here many times and just getting around to writing a review because my last weekend stay was above exceptional and all the girls in my group commented on the superb hospitality of the hotel.  The head of Food and Beverage for this hotel, Sebastian, is a gem!  He will help you with any special requests and always with a smile.  If you haven't tried staying at Palazzo, do it, you won't be disappointed.  I also think it's a more mature hipster crowd, rather than young chaos crowd ....  just my two cents!
This is a great hotel. Everyone is friendly. There fast to check you in. They have a variety of food. Tv on the bathroom was the best. Relaxation!! But what I did not like was that I bought a cheesecake and wanted to save it for later but the fridge that they have is full of wine and beer that I do not like. I could not put my food in there. I had to waste the food. But everything else was great. Will recommend. And will come back here.
Although the room is beautiful and comfortable, the air quality is awful! I stayed 6 nights for a conference and my nose and lungs got so bad. I got a bloody nose several times and my chest hurt. I was not sick. Several others from my team had the same problem. I understand that the desert air is dry, but after I left that hotel/conference center and was in the airport, my nose felt better. I have been home for 3 days and my lungs/chest still hurt and I'm coughing a lot. They need to clean the filter system! Yuck. Don't want to stay there again.
