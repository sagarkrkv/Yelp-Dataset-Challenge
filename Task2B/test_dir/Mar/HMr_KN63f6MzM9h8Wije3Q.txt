Checked in for my daughter 13th birthday night going to the Miley Cyrus concert. I got the Penthouse Suite. . . I am a local and stay at hotels on the strip for quick getaways all the time. I worked all day and while my daughter was getting ready I opened the mini bar to have a cold beer. None to be found only soda and water. I called the front desk to have the girl laugh as I let her know my mini bar wasn't stocked. . . I stay at many MGM properties and have never had anyone check me in with such a slow pace and no service skills. . . Room service couldn't do a birthday cake because "we don't have a baker on staff for the weekends" . . Valet shouted at me after I got out of my vehicle and was getting the suitcases out because he was moving the line and wanted me to get back in my car and move it for him. Don't they drive cars for a job? . . The elevator didn't work with our room key in it. We rode the elevator up and down four times before getting to our floor. . . I will never step foot into this hotel again and letting my whole network of friends family and clients know not to come here.
Stayed there Feb 26-1st. Got there around 4:30pm or so. It was a little confusing getting to the parking garage due to the construction but not a big deal. . Unlike a few of the other places I've stayed, it was a pretty quick walk to the check-in counter. No line, so checking in took no more than 10mins. . . We had a Park Avenue room(2 queen beds) with a view of the roller coaster(would be cooler to see if it was lit up at night too) and partial of the strip. You could hear the people screaming on the roller coaster only really when you're going to bed because it's quiet in the room by then. Beds were really comfortable. Bathroom was a basic bathroom, hair dryer, make-up mirror. Nice to be able to adjust the shower head to aim higher & lower, especially when your friend is shorter than you! :). . Lots of food choices. The America restaurant has decent variety and pretty convenient for when you're ready to call it a night and eat after a long night out. . Checked out Coyote Ugly on a Thursday night. Got in free so even if it had sucked, couldn't complain. It was kinda small but didn't matter. Had a great time there! . . Overall I would stay there again, just maybe ask for a room not by the roller coaster.
I'm rating off my one experience here, which was only a quick trip to go on the roller coaster. So. Much. Fun. There are signs directing you to the roller coaster, which is helpful. I went with a small group of people pretty late Saturday night- I think it was around 11. There are lockers to store your things (purses, bags, etc.) that cost .50 to use. They have them at the end of the line and there are a few at the platform to use if you've neglected to put your stuff away before getting in line. The roller coaster was quite entertaining. I especially loved that we went at night, so we got to see all the city lights flying by (although I had to take my glasses off, so everything was pretty blurry). I haven't been on a roller coaster in years (2006 was the last time, I believe), so this was a great time. Thrilling enough to keep me entertained but not scary enough to make me swear off roller coasters.
Not clean. . Where the wifi guys???. Happy with location and easy to find but the room need upgrade. . Room and resort fee RIP.
Check in dragged, but we got there right at three. Staff was pretty friendly.. . We had a suite room with a hot tub for our week long stay. The hotel could use a face lift, but our room was well updated, clean and large. The bed was incredibly comfy! The casino is the same as most the others on the strip, and it was sadly not lucky for us but we didn't spend a lot of time there. The spa at the hotel is great, and it you wait till the second day of your stay they leave you a voicemail with deals for services (I got 20% off a pedicure- by the way one of the best I've ever had!). The location is great and right in the middle of town. If you're going to be there for a bit, buy a pass for the Monorail. It really pays off.. . Coyote Ugly was fun for us, but the drinks pretty bad. We went in around 8'before going into Zumanity, and it was dead, but we got our hands stamped for free cover the rest of the night. We came back after the show, and it had livened up a little bit. The drinks were awful and expensive so we got drinks at the bar next door and went back. I wouldn't go back and back for it but it's something to do while being able to stay in the hotel. The pretzel stand outside it pretty amazing, especially after a night of dancing.
I love this hotel.  Truly.  From the moment I stepped through the doors, I loved this place.  Front desk was fast, efficient and very nice.  Our room was amazing, beautiful dark wood furniture and a bed so comfortable you sank into it - and almost didn't want to leave your room.  We had WIFI and ample storage space.  I did wish the room had a mini fridge but that's a miniscule detail.  The restaurants and bars inside the hotel were great as well.  It would of been even better if they had an eatery that was open 24 hours inside the hotel.  The gift shop was nice, and they also had a little boutique that had some cute things.  They have a show there called Zumanity, although I never checked it out.  At the very top is an arcade for the kids and they have a roller coaster...not for the faint of heart!  I was always a little too buzzed to try and ride it (hey! Don't judge! The bar on the casino floor makes great hurricanes!) Bottom line: I will definitely be back. I missed Vegas the minute I had to leave.
Checked this casino out before and after our Zumanity show.  We got comp tickets through MyVegas.  So you have to go there that day to pick up your tickets, then come back that night for the show.  We killed time gambling there, and the casino area is HUGE - with very high ceilings, which really helped to keep the air pretty clear, probably the least smoky casino we visited.  . . The show is in a pretty small theatre, so even with balcony seats we felt a lot closer than you would at other Cirque du Soleil shows.  The food and drink options were surprisingly limited and very mediocre looking.  As far the show itself, due to the setup and theme of the show it actually isn't quite as acrobatic as the other Cirque shows I've seen, and it is a smaller setup so there is less going on at once, more of a focus on one performer at a time.  But there were still some pretty great performances.  It was definitely pretty risque stuff, but my wife loved the show, so there ya go.. . Afterwards, we checked out Coyote Ugly bar.  It actually was a pretty small area, and unlike what you think from the movie, etc.  there was only one girl doing the bar-top dancing, etc. and running games.  But, she did an excellent job keeping everything going.
I really enjoyed our stay at New York New York.  I chose this one based on price and amenities and it's proximity to the airport.  There is a lot to offer here in entertainment and a choice in dining for almost any tastebud.  I really like the "sidewalk" seating.  This also seems to be a very kid friendly casino based on the seemingly hundreds of junior soccer players there during our stay
Awesome decor!!!! They make it look just like New York....
As I'm originally from New York, my husband thought it would be fun to stay at the New York-New York Hotel. Let's me just say that it didn't disappoint! There was even a small city within the hotel that highlighted all of New York's best food and entertainment. From pizza to Italian bakeries and Irish pub music to dueling pianos at the bar, you are in New York.
Our number one favorite place for price, location and the best suites,the marquis has a full size 4 seater jacuzzi tub and room to spare. The NY pizza (downstairs) has the best pizza and for a little class you gotta visit the Nine fine Irishmen.
I've always wanted to stay at NYNY and I was excited to get a good deal on our room for one night. The room was pretty nice but our view of a roof kind of sucked.. . Also it was a tiny bit disturbing to have a vent open to the hallway on the opposite side of our bathroom mirror. . . And I always wonder just how long do hotels let room service dirty dishes sit in the hallway? There was the same tray the whole time we were there.. Gross!. . I was sad to leave after one night though since we were really enjoying ourselves. I'd totally stay again but try to get a room with a better view.
2 dollar minimum craps and some strong comp long islands is enough to make the NYNY my favorite stop on the strip for a poor college student budget Vegas weekend. Throw in the dueling piano bar and I'm sold! . . Seriously though if I were to be asked what my favorite hotel was before I got to Vegas, I don't think I would have answered with NYNY. I really like the Cosmo, and Ceasars, and hotels with better more modern decorum, but NYNY wins out because of their drinks and casino alone in my book.
