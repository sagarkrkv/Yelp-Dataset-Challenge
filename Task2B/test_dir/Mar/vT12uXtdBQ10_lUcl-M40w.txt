Was in town for my friend's 40th birthday and stayed at Bally's. Dirty room. Found toe nail clippings throughout the room including a massive big toe toenail clipping.
I've stayed at Bally's twice now, once in newer rooms and once in the cheapest room. The newer rooms are comfortable, on par with any mid-scale nice hotel chain. The older rooms are...old and worn. But if you need to stay on a budget and want to be in the middle of the Strip, there are few better choices. It's true, the location is really hard to beat. This is especially true when using the monorail since there's a station attached. "Who uses the monorail in Vegas?!" I do - it works.. . I also like the table games at Bally's. They're usually cheaper and don't have hardcore players at them. I found a $5 Texas Hold'em table that was a blast, especially for those who aren't serious poker players but want to play (the tournament rooms on the other hand are too intense). There's also sports betting and cheap food options in-house.. . So not the nicest place to stay, but if you're on a budget or can go with an upgraded room, Bally's is just fine. Plus you're in Vegas, you shouldn't be in your room much anyway, right?
Centrally located right across the street you got Bellagio and next door you got Paris and it's even connected! I would think that this is the oldest hotel on the strip right now since everything seems so renovated on the outside other than flamingo.. Unfortunately it's not even at the top five oldest!. . The rooms are a bit dated try the deluxe rooms but if you're on a budget the regular rooms are ok too. It's clean and reasonable since you're going to just sleep and take shower there right?. . Walking out and walking to the monorail is long walk though. I don't think I ever rode the monorail since college lol...And there's really nothing to see inside since it's not themed. Like you would see Parisian things in Paris or the garden in Bellagio. It's a hotel that people usually pass by unless you stay there or accidentally walk through from Paris.
Right on the Vegas strip, great place to stay, however no free Wi-Fi is a disappointment.
Definitely the WORST hotel on the strip! If you want rude front desk people checking you in, wrong reservations, overflowing toilets, unmade beds and 5am wake up calls with construction workers drilling away outside your room...then this is the place to stay!! . . OVERALL WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE! I have been to Vegas 100s of times and never have I been so disgusted by the "customer service" or lack thereof. And to top it off, when I tried to complain, the manager Jose (who was so rude) gave us a measly comp at the cafe! What an INSULT! It took over 2.5 months to finally get a hold of another manager (Darryl) who ended up being even worse than Jose. . . After spending over $450 for 4 nights and enduring 2 unbearably loud mornings waking up  to pounding drilling noises, one of these managers should have adequately compensated us for ALL THE INCONVENIENCE!!!  The Caesars Acquisition Company (which owns Bally's, Harrah's, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Flamingo..etc) SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES!!! At least learn how to train your management at Bally's to be a little accommodating!!!!. . Corporate offices will definitely be hearing from me soon! Attached with a video clip of the horrendous construction noises!
I have a long history with Bally's. Years ago when I first started going to Vegas, I stayed at Bally's, and for some reason they always upgraded my room. So it always made me a happy camper and so I kept going back. I have great memories of this place.. . Fast forward - I recently stayed here in the Jubilee tower. Wow. What an upgrade in itself. The rooms have been updated and are now a bright red with some really cute accents. They have been modernized - gone is the dark blue (or overwhelming beige) of the other rooms and ushered in is bright red and dark brown. They are really put together nicely - a nice modern touch. I really liked this room. . . This time, the room looked to the north, so we could see the Flamingo next door, and the ever cool looking High Roller as they were testing the lights. Definitely a good view. . . I like Bally's because I really like the area of the strip it is in. There's a lot around and a lot going on - so it's the perfect location. The casino itself is so-so, but hey, can always walk to Paris, right?. . Drawbacks: a couple - you can hear a lot even high up. So if you're wondering what that strange noise is that sounds like cannons - it is. It's the fountains at the Bellagio.. . The second big drawback is the casino floor layout. Bringing my bags into the hotel, from the parking garage, there aren't many ramps, so to get to the Jubilee tower or even to the check in, you have to drag your bags up and down the stairs several times. Not fun. . . One other complaint - they have cheapened up and no longer have conditioner in the hotel room. Fortunately, I had brought my own, so I didn't call and ask if they had any, but I would hate to have to buy it if they didn't. Other than that, I can say my experience was quite pleasant.
It doesn't look great. It's not the newest and most renovated in Las Vegas. It can be quite smokey inside but you know what, for the price and location, you can't really beat it. . . The staff was extremely friendly. . . Sadly, my room, on my last day, I found an empty vodka bottle underneath my mattress, which worries me. I hope the staff changes their sheets because I don't understand how that was possibly missed!
Was hesitant about our stay here after reading reviews. However, our room was just fine. Updated, flat screen tv. Not the outdated 80s decor as shown in other photos.. Has a little strip mall on it's basement level - good to get your souveniers at. . Breakfast buffet is well worth it's price! Get there early, the line to get in gets long, as well as the line at the buffet. Also, the mimosas are NOT bottomless - you pay for each one. Boo!. Pool is outdoor, so it's closed during the winter.. Good size casino floor - it was always fairly busy.. Connected to Paris, which is super convenient especially if you have part of your group staying there.. . The biggest downside: the casino floor was very smoky compared to other casinos.. Upside: amazing location on the strip. . . Will stay here again.
Very nice I'm impressed....
COMPED ROOM. . Last month I stayed at the Flamingo. A couple of weeks after I came back I checked my Total Rewards account. I noticed that I was eligible to comp a free room at Bally's. I wasn't planning to go back to Vegas anytime soon however I had to redeem my Asia Miles frequent flyer miles, which I earned 4 years ago when I went to South Africa for the World Cup, by the end of April. Because of those two factors I decided to go back to Vegas again. . . At Bally's I stayed for 4 free nights. I was very happy with my room at the Indigo Tower. The room was spacious compared to most standard rooms. I had a lot of space on the left side of the bed. On the left side of the bed was a couch and a small coffee table. This was an ideal room for a free vacation. The room was clean and there was no cockroaches as I've read from other reviews. This room felt I was the king. With all the amenities and the room free of charge (with the of the resort fees) why didn't I give a perfect 5 star rating? First even though the room was spacious the wall was close to the right side of the bed. The best hotel room I ever stayed at was the Roman Tower at Caesars Palace. That room was spacious but also was equally spaced on both sides of the bed; a wall wasn't closed to either side of the bed. Second like the Flamingo last month the swimming pool was closed. Since the season is late winter/ early spring I wanted to relax and swim in the pool. Other than those two issues the room at the Indigo Tower at Bally's is a great room if you're eligible to comp it.
We chose to stay at Bally's because of it's location on the strip.. Upon arriving at the hotel, we asked about an upgrade, and for an additional $20 we got a Jacuzzi tub and a view of "The Linq".. . The good:. Location on the strip can'tbe beat, right across from the Bellagio and connected to the Paris. Didn't feel like I had to walk too far to anything. Close to bus stop out in front. . . The room was nice and clean on a non smoking floor.. . Spacious floor plan and comfortable bed.. . Multiple sinks and great vanity area for a girl and her makeup, there is even a little stool to sit on. . . . The not-so-good:. The tile in the bath area is ridiculously slippery when the slightest bit wet, and the shower temperature and pressure was poor. . . Whenever someone above or below you uses their shower, the loud sound of water wakes you up, as does the sirens on the street passing by multiple times a night. I, however, had a terrible head cold on my trip so I had trouble sleeping anyway.. . The pool was closed and construction being done at the entrance.. . I understand Vegas isn't cheap, but $3.50 for a bottle of water in the shop downstairs? Room service has a $20 minimum plus delivery fee - they wanted $15 for hot water for tea?! Luckily I didn't bother. . . No mini fridge - maybe only suites have them?. . I know people don't come to Vegas to watch TV in their room, but since I had the aforementioned head cold, I had to come back to the room to rest and the channels are extremely limited. Mostly Vegas ads, and Japanese channels.. . . All in all, the location trumps the other issues and I would stay here again (next time with no cold!)
Kinda old and dirty hotel/casino. Receptionists were less than helpful. Room was nice and large though.
Sleeping arrangements for fifteen consisted of four rooms with two queens in each. . That's room for eight, I know.. But we're all dudes in town for the NCAA March Madness Tournament and that means not everyone will be in their room sleeping at the same time. . It works out. It does every year.. Except this year.. . The little bitch at check-in informed us all they had were single beds and no connecting rooms. She said to guarantee sleeping arrangements, we needed to pay an additional fifteen dollars when booking. . One problem.. Hotels.com doesn't have a guarantee feature for fifteen dollars, or any amount for that matter.. . Fifteen adult males in four rooms with four beds. . Even if I was gay, it still would have been a problem due to the man stench after day two, a blend of beer farts and that cheap shit perfume strippers wear.. . If that wasn't bad enough, Bally's stuck us in rooms atop the Indigo Nightclub where those of us who did try to sleep couldn't, due to the rhythmic thumping from 2am to 8 am. Their after-hours party.. . It gets better.. Bally's, in their infinite wisdom, knowing fully well Spring Break and March Madness occurred on the same weekend, booked a handicap convention for the same time.. The National Ataxia Foundation.. Fucking great.. . A convention for people who are unable to walk, their only ambulatory device being either a walker or Rascal motorized scooter.. . No sleep.. Trance, albums #1-7 burned into my brain.. Feeling bad about myself from cutting off Rascal drivers whenever the first available elevator opened. . Who needs that shit.. . The fifteen of us will take our business anywhere next year but Bally's.. Bally's, you suck horse balls.
Stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms for a convention. The room was spacious and pretty nice. I had a great view of Paris hotel and everything was clean. Would stay there again in the newly renovated section.
