It's been a while since I went to the Buffet at Bellagio last time. I remember my first impression - fantastic! All together I went there 4 or 5 times and loved it every time. Don't understand why some people are not impressed - was it a bad day for the buffet or a personal bad day?
The Bellagio has always been my favorite buffet in the world and I myself am a huge buffet eater.  Every time I am in Vegas I am sure to hit this place.   I have been very happy every sing time until the recent visits.  Their decision to keep breakfast food on the buffet throughout the day instead of adding the usual lunch items, makes this place a total waste.  The breakfast fair is on pair with a golden corral nothing special.  Even though they are still serving mostly breakfast they do continue to up charge you.  It is so bad I didn't even see things like corn on the buffet except cold corn for salads.  I guess it is time to try Wynns new place or that 17 million dollar new buffet a ceasers.
When my family go to Las Vegas for CES we stay at the Bellagio and always eat at this buffet. It's pretty good and lots of variety.
I cant say much other than purw amazement! This place had EVERYTHING and the best part is it all tasted as if I made it at home and thats saying a lot since i'm a classically trained chef! Much love to all the kitchen workers here... They do a GREAT job! Our server was awesome too
My family and I went to the Bellagio buffet on a Friday night and we paid $37 each. It seemed to be on the somewhat pricey side, but the great variety of food made up for it. The line was took more than half an hour. That was okay since we expected it to be long anyway.. . Some of the more memorable, tasty dishes that I enjoyed were Alaskan king crab legs, lamb chops, prime rib, Kobe beef, and sea bass. I especially liked the desserts, such as macarons, bread pudding, and chocolate covered strawberries. Soda and juices were included in the price. Service was good as well.. . Overall, with such a price expected at Las Vegas, I think the wide selection of dishes makes this a decent hotel buffet.
Over the years I've been to many Las Vegas buffets and I would say my all time favorite is the one at the Bellagio.  With a well rounded selection of foods, I find the Buffet at the Bellagio the best restaurant to hit up when I'm absolutely starving and want to take down copious amounts of delicious food.  Prices are a bit high, but the food is worth it.  And after a long day or night of having fun, a smorgasbord of food is just what one needs.
My family and I came to eat at the bellagio buffet this evening. I got the idea to come here after I saw a piece on it from food network. I was a LITTLE let down because it seemed a lot better on the show. There was a small variety of different food. . To be 100% honest, the buffet in the grand Sierra in Reno has a wider selection than this buffet had. The food was pretty good, but the desserts were delicious. . I ordered a mojito with my meal. I was rather disappointed in my drink. . For 3 people your looking to spend $130 just to get in.
I have tried just about every buffet on the strip and this one is my personal favorite. However, depending on your tastes, you might like others better. I am crazy about quality seafood, sushi, salad, and crab legs.  Its the only buffet on the strip that offers sashimi poke, and steak tartar at less than $50. . However, if you don't do sushi and prefer comfort foods with a different twist, this might not be the place for you. You can also find better deserts elsewhere.. That being said, I still feel that Bellagio has the best food at the best value in Vegas.
$40 and I am stuffed! Chicken that has waffle breading, candied apples and crab legs! Yes! I loved it. There's so much to choose from that you can eat something different every time you go up!
Vegas + Buffet = Lots of food. Good solid buffet at Bellagio. We happened to have some credits and gave it a shot. Good, nothing special, nothing overly below average either.
My wife and I came here on a Wednesday evening at about 5:45pm and walked right in with no line.  The food station selections were a little better than most buffets that I have been to.. . The flank steak and prime rib were delicious, as was the poke.  The rice on the nigiri sushi  could have been a little smaller, but that's OK.  The beef roast that they were trying to pass off as a Kobe beef roast was just regular roast beef.  If it were real Kobe beef, that meat would have been buttery tender with no effort in cutting or chewing.  The king crab legs were great, especially when heated!  I don't think anyone knew that they could have it heated, as I was the only one requesting this (or the other people just liked really cold crab).. . I went to look for a pair of chopsticks at the sushi bar and did not find any.  I asked the counter person and he directed me to another station, where again I didn't find any.  I asked our waiter for chopsticks and he promptly directed me to the sushi bar.  It was not busy at this time and he did not provide good customer service by saying that he will be right back with some chopsticks.  I did finally find chopsticks because previously, no one cared to fill the basket up.  For this incident with the waiter and other staff, I cannot give a 5-star rating.  I work at the Wynn where customer service is everything and that is why no 5th star.. . Other than that, the waiter was pretty good at keeping our beverages filled besides giving me regular iced tea on a refill rather than raspberry tea.  Will I be back?  Most definitely.  Some things can be overlooked.  I think I may have found my new favorite buffet!
Allot of food choices, very vegetarian friendly. The price is okay for the amount of food you get. You must try the omelette bar. You have options for every meal at any time of day. Breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner. A must for every visit to Vegas.
Please keep in mind this was my first time to any of the Las Vegas buffets. . . That being said, GOOD GOD LORD BABY JESUS SWEET ALLAH HOLY BUDDHA. It was everything I wanted and more. I came at 1pm and they still had breakfast food available! Since I came during the st paddy's day weekend, I had to pay the holiday lunch price(even though it wasn't st paddy's day) which was $35/person. Still not bad! It's an additional $12/person if you wanted unlimited domestic drinks/beers/bloody Mary's/mimosas. . . So anyways we got seated quickly and was able to get our food while our drinks were on the way. . . HIGHLY RECOMMEND: prime steak, eggs Benedict, eclair, strawberry tart, salad, pizza. . I would stay away from their seafood as it wasn't that great but their selection is nonetheless GREAT. I would highly recommend this buffet to anyone looking to pig out in Vegas!
Not worth it!  The eggs Benedict was good tasting, but cold!  All the other food was very bland.  They need to focus on quality and not quantity!!!  Too many selections of bland food!
After all the hype, I finally got to experience this buffet.  It is an ok buffet, but definitely not a contender for best in Vegas.  They have a variety of desserts, but no real standout dish for me.  The wait was down the ramp, around the ropes, but only took about 30 mins.  Maybe it was over-hyped and my expectations too high, but I don't think I would return to this one.  I heard this buffet has steadily declined since Steve Wynn sold the place.  It is one to try once to rest your curiosity, but if you miss it, you will live.
This honestly has to be the most expensive effin' buffet that I have ever eaten at, but my other RE/MAX buddies wanted to eat here, so I thought "why not?".  . . This ended up being really good though!  They had sushi that was fair considering we were nowhere near water (LOL), prime rib which was tasty, and a whole bunch of other fare.  They even offer certain adult beverages on an "all you can drink" deal.  I did not partake of this because this has to be cheap liquor for them to do all you can drink.  . . Give this a try, it's well worth the $40 something you'll pay!
I've eaten here a couple times. It's my second favorite buffet in Vegas. I like to come just before dinner so I can pay for lunch and get the dinner spread. Again, love the crab legs! Love the meats, the salads, the breads, etc... . The Bacchanal Buffet just had the upper hand for some reason, I guess the way they serve the crab legs at The Bacchanal is quicker, because there's a station where you can pick up cold crab legs and another separate station if you want boiled crab legs. The line at Bellagio was so slow! . I did have a great sort of private booth, it made the experience better. . The line for this buffet went so slow too! The Bacchanal went fast, just to let ya know!. The food is still top notch though.
MUCH BETTER.   :). . My husband and I enjoyed lunch here on a Thursday afternoon, and were happy to have a much more pleasant experience with the food and the service than when we visited during the month prior.. . The servers and hostesses seemed less confused and disorganized from the moment we walked up, however, they were not very friendly and seemed to not care about much personal interaction with the guests as we waited in line.. . I had several of the sushi items and a hearty salad from the salad bar, and everything was fresh and delicious.  The Salmon and crab roll was particularly tasty, and the tuna sushi was also very good.  My husband had a few slices of prime rib that he said were very tender and perfect to make into a mini-sandwich with some of the plentiful bread options.  We also were happy with the service we received, which was much more attentive and friendlier than we had experienced prior.  . . The one issue we had was the when you order a mimosa they bring you the champagne (sparkling wine, really), and the orange juice separately.  I recommend serving mimosas without this presentation, and it does not bode well for cleanliness or guest enjoyment.  . . We will consider dining here again on an upcoming Vegas trip, and were happy to see the food & service here back on par with what people come to expect of a dining establishment at the Bellagio.  Cheers!
This place is gross, disgusting, dirty, and a complete rip off. The serving counters are filthy and so close together that you're  rubbing derriere with total strangers. I will NEVER eat at this overpriced dump again. They don't even serve real ice cream here! Go to Aria buffet it's clean and deeeeeelicious!!!
Overpriced for mediocre typical buffet food.  This place probably used to be the buffet to be at but Vegas has evolved and this buffet is not up to speed.  Service was lacking, which is tough at a buffet seeing as how the only thingwe needed was to place a drink order and have our drinks refilled.. . The Aria Buffet and Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmopolitan were MUCH better quality, better selection and comparable prices.
Here for the brunch. It's not bad it's just not living up to the reviews. I would compare it to the rio buffet.
