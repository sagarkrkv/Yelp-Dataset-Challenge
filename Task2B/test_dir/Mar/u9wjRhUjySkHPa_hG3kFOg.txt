I would like to give this place a 3.5!!!. . The rooms are so white my eyes hurt. I've been waiting to try the Wynn when it first opened. Got a chance during Thanksgiving when the price was an amazing $129 per night..yeah that's the lowest it will ever get. I thought I would get the $50 resort credit but I didn't read the fine print. If I was going with my friends this is waste of your money you can go to other hotels for cheap and still get the comfort of hotels. If you go with parents or significant other and would like to sleep in etc. I do recommend and at least you can check out the amenities this hotel has. I actually had to work and it was comfortable in the desk with the view of the strip.
I could give this resort 10 stars. Five is not enough for this remarkable property. Yes it's more expensive, and yes it's superior to any hotel on the strip. Make sure you have dinner at the SW Steakhouse and visit the Sinatra bar. Every detail of this hotel that Steve Wynn created is just magnificent and mind blowing how every customer is treated like gold. How is that for a review?
Beautiful Hotel. Most beautiful lobby Decor with the flowers. Just breathtaking. The rooms are so beautiful with the red carpet it truly make you feel like a Royal. Not to mention the mirror ceiling wow sexiness!!! Also the view is absolutely amazing especially the one overlooking the mountains. The best of both worlds! : )
Definitely the rudest hotel staff I ever encountered. Everyone was rude. The check-in people were rude, the concierge was rude, the maids were rude and intrusive, the restaurant staff was rude, the people who worked at the gift store were rude, and the luggage storage guys outside the hotel were rude. It's like, "Wow, I'm paying a butt-load of money to stay here and I'm being treated like dirt." . . Steve Wynn must not care about keeping his customers at all because I never want to step inside that hotel again.
Here is my comprehensive review of one of my favorite hotels in the world:. . ROOMS: If I could afford it, I would live in a Salon Suite in the Wynn Towers for the rest of my life. My first time going to Vegas over 21+, I was spoiled silly being able to stay in the Salon Suite courtesy of one of my high-roller friends. I pretty much ruined it for myself because nothing can ever live up to that experience again. From the impeccable service, to the amazing floor to ceiling views, and plush carpet that feel like heaven after 4+ hours of standing in 4 inch heels, everything about the Wynn screams luxury fit for a princess. And at an average rate of $800/night for this Suite, it better.. . I've also stayed in the more affordable Deluxe Resort King at the Wynn and the Resort Suite King at the Encore, the attached sister hotel. Both are a downgrade from the size and amenities of a larger suite, but are still very comfortable and provide the same immaculate quality of service. . . THEME: The hotel itself is quite spacious and feels much airier than some of the other hotel casinos. The theme is classic with a modern twist, so both young and older patrons will feel comfortable, which may not be the case in some of the newer hotels such as the ultra-modern Cosmopolitan. . . CASINO: I'm not a big gambler so I can't say much about the quality of the tables here except that the minimums are higher than average for the strip.. . FOOD: "Affordable," the food options here are not. However, there are some flavorful choices that won't break the buck. I particular enjoy the Red 8 Asian Bistro for their Braised Pork Knuckle with Taiwanese Flat Noodle Soup. Of course, the award-wining Wynn Buffett is worth a stop if you want a quintessential Vegas Buffet experience. With the onset of newer buffets opening, I wouldn't say it's the best buffet in the city, but it's convenient if you're staying here and like crab legs. Unfortunately, staying here will not give you discounts to any of their restaurants. . . CLUBS: Wynn and Encore are home to 3 nightclubs: XS, Surrender, and Tryst, and 1 dayclub: Encore Beach. Staying at either hotel allows you to use a special entrance when entering XS and Encore Beach which can be lifesaving if the line is ridiculously long (always). If you are a guest, you can also request complimentary tickets when you check in and they may or may not have some available depending on the day of week, headliner, etc. . . Of the 3 nightclubs, XS is the largest, most popular, and my favorite. During the winter months, when they close the outside, it can get extremely stuffy so I would recommending getting a table to avoid getting your feet stomped on. But in the summer, there's tons of space and its a much nicer experience. The best part of XS is their Sunday Night Swim which is basically a big pool party at night. You are encouraged to wear your bathing suit (under your clubbing outfits) and splash around to the sweet, drunken melody of EDM. . . Surrender and Tryst are much smaller and underwhelming when compared to the behemoth that is XS. Both are nice options however, if you're with a group of guys wanting to pay less. Surrender gets better headliners and opens up to Encore Beach in the summer. . . Encore Beach Club (EBC) is an awesome dayclub. Yes, their drinks are overpriced and there are suspicious things floating in the water, especially later in the evening, but it's beautiful, I don't have to wear heels, and the DJs are pretty much touching distance. It's huge compared to some of the other day clubs so it's never too squished in the water.  . . OVERALL: If you can afford it, this the place to stay in Vegas.
Very nice tapas, each one tastier than the other, nice atmosphere, modern look of the restaurant. Unfortunately the service was terrible. It took forever to get anyone's attention once we got seated. There were 4 of us and the service unfortunately will make me not rate this place very high. Also bring your wallet......
just got back from a 3 day mid-week stay at Wynn, our first time there.  Nice hotel, great buffet, staff was friendly, all as expected.   The resort fee of $ 25 per day covers the usual (WiFi, gym, pool, etc).  . My one complaint:  We went to the pool on a somewhat cool day (mid 60s) to get a little sun.  The main pool is closed for the season (no big deal), but they have the smaller Sunset pool open.  It's a big rectangle shaped pool with 8 large round lounges in the pool, and chaises on all 4 sides of the pool.  Here's the problem: all the lounges in the pool, and all the chairs in the front row are "Reserved".  I asked the pool attendant who these chairs are reserved for...his answer..."People who pay for them".  I told him that my daily resort fee covered pool use. Not so much.. Apparently, if you actually want a chair in the sun, you have to pay extra.  Of the 100+ people at the pool, nobody had paid for a "Reserved" seat.  No extra revenue for Wynn.  What they did accomplish was pissing off every single pool-using customer that was forced to take a chair in the shade.  This is not "5 Star Resort" level customer service.  Next time, we're going back to the Four Seasons.  They know how a high-end resort works.
Hands-down, my favorite place to stay in Vegas! Amazing (and more importantly, consistent) service and amenities. I have now stayed here 3 times and have zero complaints. Steve Wynn has really done an exceptional job to create the best hotel on the strip. The views from the hotel are amazing- I have stayed in the tower suites facing the strip and also facing the golf course- both are beautiful. Also LOVE SW Steahouse and Mizumi for sushi! Everyone should experience this hotel at least once in their life!
Stayed in a Villa and was absolutely amazed! We had our own private pool on the balcony of the villa. Anything we needed was at our beck and call and everyone was extremely nice! They made reservations for us at places they thought we would like without ever asking and there was always a person to drive us somewhere when needed. Ordered room service one morning and it was amazing! Would definitely stay here again.
Let me start by saying that the Wynn Las Vegas is an absolutey beautiful hotel. If you have ever been to Vegas and toured around many of the hotels (specially on the strip) you are hit right in the face every time you step foot in the Wynn just how elevated and above all others they really are. . . We decided to head to Vegas a day early and try a night at the Wynn (already booked at the Bellagio). Booked a Tower King room, Non-Smoking. Upon arrival greeted by the valet, bellman and off to a great start. The valet at the Wynn is much more intimate than most resort/hotels in Vegas. Sets the mood for the hotel experience at the  Wynn and I really like the difference. . . Then we hit the Registration Desk. Maybe it was the dud we ended up with, but considering the reputation and considerable expense just to say there we were expecting much better service. Maybe the clerk was not blessed with any discernible  personality, or maybe he was having a bad day? Either way check in was lacking in a big way. That can be overlooked, until you get to your room and open the door and are hit in the face with the powerful lingering smell of cigarette smoke. Yep, you guessed it. Even though I booked a Non-Smoking room......we ended up in a smoking room on an all smoking floor! The room itself was nice (if not totally in order), but I was on the phone immediately to request the Non-Smoking room I had reserved. Though the front desk operator was polite, I was informed that while I had requested a Non-Smoking room when making my reservation, that was not a guarantee. You would think this was a little tidbit the registration clerk would have mentioned? They put me on hold and when they came back on the line, I was informed that the only option available right away was a room with 2 full beds. That was unacceptable, and I really found it hard to believe that on a Wed. in Vegas the  Wynn had no other options available specially since they tried to pawn off an upgrade at check in because they had the room availability. I was placed back on hold and again informed that at that time the double bed option was the only option. I asked her several times what the wait time would be for a king bed option (as she implied that these rooms were coming avail.), and could not get a straight answer. Place on hold for a third time, and finally pay dirt! They did, in fact have a Tower room w/King bed ready to go. We were informed that our current key cards would work, just needed to head to the new floor/room and should be good to go. So, down the elevator bank and up another bank we went. As you can probably guess the key cards did not work so down to the registration desk we went. Thankfully there was separate registration desk in the Tower so not a long treck to have new keys issued. . . The second room was not completely ready to go, the furniture was also mismatched and dirty. My husband and I both got the impression that this was a kind of throw away room, somewhere you place the overflow. At the Wynn, you would have expected much, much more. Disappointed for sure. . . Our experience did improve from there however. We had a fabulous meal at Botero thanks to the recommendation from our bellman Bob. Room service the next morning was among some of the best we have ever had, and the food was wonderful. The Wynn manages to handle those details that most other hotel/resorts in Vegas lag way behind. This is noticed throughout the whole facility. Service at the registration desk upon check out was night and day from the day before. . . Will we be back? Maybe, if the price was right.
My gf's and I came here for her birthday. Her bf and his friends had deals for the hotel so I was glad to check it out since I've never been, only for the buffet ;) The inside is real nice and clean. Lots of pretty colorful decorations. Very nice gambling layout. A few nice restaurants and a cafe. . . We stayed at a room, that we got to luckily upgrade to 2 full size beds instead of 1 queen size.  We had a great view and at night it was so pretty. Right as we walked in it was real spacious, good layout and the lighting was real welcoming. I loved the bathroom. The sinks with a vanity in the middle. Perfect for 4 girls sharing a bathroom. And as you enter there's a huge mirror so you can look at yourself from head to toe. That's a plus for us ladies before we head out to the clubs and for selfies hahah. The bed was pretty comfy, which is always a plus. . . I went to the gym which is located in the spa area. The gym is a decent size. When you enter you check yourself in. They have towels, water and fruits. There is a few trainers on the floor. in the front is some treadmills and cardio machines. As you walk a bit towards the back there are weights and other machines. The gym was clean and great to get a quick work out session. . . Service was great! every time we asked for something they brought it up and always called to make sure we got what we asked for. Make sure to always have your room key because there is a worker in front of the elevators that you have to flash your room key to. Wynn is a great hotel and a good mix of people.
Overpriced, but then again you get what you pay for... I prefer staying at other nearby hotels. I probably won't stay here again, unless I get the same deal. Just don't see the value...
The staff from valet parking, registration, housekeeping, and dining were extremely friendly.  The view from our room was spectacular overlooking the strip.
My husband and I went here for his graduation present. I surprised him for graduating with a master's software engineering degree.  We had gotten the king deluxe suite. We had so much of a good time I don't think we will book anywhere else. This is it and will now on be our place to stay every time we go!
This is a first class hotel. This is my first choice of hotels in Vegas.  The beds are the best.
Byfar the best hotel on the strip!  Stayed in the tower suites and I'll be back again
I am not sure why some of the visitors give low rating.  We have stayed at this hotel more than 20 times and we've never been disappointed.  First class everything.  The restaurants, the exotic sceneries, the rooms, the buffet and the clubs are all second to none.  This is a very high-end hotel and most people are dressed very nicely.  It is the hotel to see and be seen.  This is what my wife and I call the beautiful people hotel.  Try the green juice at the cafe.  It's one of the best.  Also, only hotel to give out Fiji water when playing.  Everything is over the top.  Bring money because everything is a little more expensive here compared to other hotels and make sure you're ready to dress up.  Le Reve is also one of the best shows in Vegas.  It means "dream" and truly is like you're dreaming during this show.
Lovely hotel. Staff is professional, helpful, and polite. Hotel is beautiful. People inside are well dressed. Everything in the hotel is just very pleasing to the eyes. Great restaurants inside and the best clubs.
The hotel was beautiful--great lobby, nice restaurants (I loved the buffet!) and pretty, large, clean rooms. The bathtub is big enough for 2 (or maybe 3, wink wink) and the bed was very comfortable.  The only negative experience I had was that the front desk staff wouldn't let us check in. We arrived at 12:30AM and they said we could check in at 5AM. We offered to pay the $350 night fee for the early check in, and they said it would be $700 (for 5.5 hours!) WTF? Needless to say we spend the 5.5 hours sleeping in the sports betting room until we could check in....they definitely did not go out of their way to make sure we were satisfied customers. Then put us in a shitty low room facing a parking lot.... . I would return, though Mandalay Bay and the Venetian are still higher on my list!
