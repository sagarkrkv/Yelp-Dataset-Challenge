Been here a few times. Very contemporary design. Lobby is clean and looks great upon entry. . . NO self-parking. Valet only. Two nearest possible locations for self parking would be to park at the Aria, going towards the west valet and cutting across outside, over the bridge over Harmon and back in OR you can park at the bellagio, and walk passed the flower garden towards the jean phillipe patisserie, and along the path towards the tram but following signs towards Vdara instead of going on the tram. Both estimates around ~10 minutes walking time. . . Now for the rooms :P . . Executive Corner Suite - Have been in this room twice. Corner room. Room designed in a long upside down L shape. Upon entry, a dining table for 4 on the right. On the left, you have a 1/2 bath as well as a mini kitchen with full size fridge, stove, and microwave. In a "closet" you have a washer/dryer as well. The living room has a sofa as well as a chair with coffee table for the TV area as well as a desk facing outwards by the window. Turning the corner, you'll have a door-separated room for the bedroom. Bed is super comfy with reading lights on each side. Bathroom has a walk-in shower, twin sinks, as well as a separate stand-alone bath tub window-side. Great for relaxing in the tub and enjoying the view ! Great room for parties. Lots of room for a good amount of people, while being able to have the bedroom off-limits to guests :D. . Vdara Suite - Much smaller room in comparison to the executive corner suite but a lot nicer compared to a normal hotel room. Upon entry, there is a small 2-person dining table as well as a mini kitchenette with a microwave and stove. There are two mini fridges. One is stocked by the hotel (charges apply upon use) and an empty one. But these mini fridges are super small. Good for a few drinks, thats about it. Before getting to the bedroom area, you'll see the bathroom. Bathroom has a single sink with a standard size bathtub and a walk in shower. Bedroom has divider that separates the sitting area with a TV with a sofa and chair, and the bed with a TV as well. Like the executive corner suite, it has two reading lights as well as two separate lights on the side. For some reason, the bedroom portion is brighter than the sitting area. Sitting area only has 1 light. . . Valet is good. Fast service and quick response. . . Overall, great hotel to stay in or to use for parties. After a specific time, they'll start restricting entry to elevators to those with only key cards. Two separate elevator lobbies for a lower portion and higher portion of the hotel.
Horrible customer service the guy getting our cab RANDY was a duche bag he wasnt considerate of peoples mood he just immediately judged and gave EXTREME ATTITUDE. WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF RANDY. Thanks VDARA glad I stayed here.. . Suggestion, get rid of your horrible terrible employees such as RANDY getting people cabs. Not a very informed guy.
Hidden gem between Cosmo and aria. Easy access to bellagio, aria, and 5 min walk to Cosmo. Starbucks in the lobby.
Great Place to have HQ for Bachelor Party.. . . Just got back from an awesome LV weekend, while my thoughts are still intact, I wanted to write it down.. . Vdara customer service is above-average! I originally booked a City-Corner Suite, got an email to upgrade to the Panoramic Suite, which has awesome views on the LV strip. The discount was so cheap it was hard to say no! . . Upon arriving, I was greeted by an very friendly associate. I then gave her my ID and Credit Card ($40 between the two), and she offered me another upgrade, on the house. Which was the 1 brdm-2 story penthouse on the 56th floor (which is the highest floor). . . The view from the Penthouse was worth the generous tip and i would do it again a 100 times over. Although the rest of the weekend was a blur, I can say that the bachelor that I host will remember the kick@$$ penthouse with the skyline view we stayed in.. . The other thing about Vdara is that there is no casino, which I was perfectly happy about. Because Cosmo and Aria 3 min walk outside can suit those needs. It felt like a true resort that happens to be in Vegas.
My friend owns a timeshare so we were able to book a day before arrival. (Last minute trip...). Vdara is located in the City Center. Beautiful, modern, clean, simple venue and layout. No casino... just a lobby, convenient store/food joint, Starbucks, and pretty bar. Love it. The room layout is awesommme. Very spacious... and yay for a kitchen! . . My only complaint is the lighting. I know... dimly lit is sexy, but not when you're trying to do your make up... no matter how hard you try, you will never look right in their mirrors. Then you end up cakin shit on and you come out lookin like shit. No buens.
This hotel is very nice. Like everybody is saying it is tucked away in the back of city center. They only have valet parking no self parking garage. I liked it because there is no casino lobby does not smell like smoke. all the people from the valet people to the people checking you in to security to housekeeping were all friendly. Now on to the room. all I can say is WOW. I booked a regular room at first then got a email about a week later asking if I wanted to upgrade for an extra 15.00 more and i figured why not. I am so happy I did .  I ended up getting a room with the view of the bellagio water fountain. bed in the room was very comfy. bathroom are very nice. kitchen is nice also. couch with pullout bed was OK.  Overall I would stay at this place again hands down. this hotel is at the top of my list  for hotels on the strip.
The best place for the money if you have your family with you.  I love the location and the fact it does not have slots and a bunch of drunk ppl and smoke all over the place. very clean and nice rooms.  I've stayed here 5+ times and is one of my first choice when with the kids.
"What a luxurious and modern hotel to stay at...". . VOUCHER:Purchase a voucher from travelzoo which was only $79 per night.... . ONE NIGHT ONLY: Stayed there for one night and then had breakfast at the Vdara Market Cafe (best place for a quick & over priced breakfast, I recommend having some PHO instead).... . BEDS: So roomy and comfortable! Loved the hot tub & sofa by the window!. . Would be back, back, back, when travelzoo has another special ;)
I had the pleasure of staying at this lovely location and to say I enjoyed myself is an understatement!  I checked in and the young woman at the front desk put my boyfriend and I on the 50th floor facing the bellagio fountain talk about a beautiful view! The room itself was comfy with modern decor.  The bed was amazing and the spa tub in the bathroom was relaxing.  The customer service here is great.  Now the hotel itself is a non smoking non casino hotel and personally I liked that. It was quiet and fresh here especially after walking around the strip with smokers and the noise of a casino.  Its also valet parking only. I myself enjoyed that feature. All in all, the hotel is beautiful and I had a great time.  Ill be back again! !
The hotel suite has breathtaking panoramic view of Las Vegas--one of the most beautiful views I have seen and It is exceptionally romantic at night.  The room we stayed was extra clean, spacious and modern. We were concerned about the bed bugs as one previous review has posted photo, and the hotel manager offered extra care to make sure our room is bug free. I like that it's casino free hotel and it feels more private and quiet, yet easily accessible to nearby casino hotels. We were able to walk everywhere.. . The gym was extremely clean, but with quite limited machine selection. The spa facility was also very modern and very, very well quipped. I got to use the jacuzzi on my own and it felt like heaven.  They stocked up cranberry juice, hot tea and bottled water everywhere. The massage was decent, but not the best I have had.  The spa front desk staff who checked us in was cold and unfriendly, and that's the reason of one star off.
We recently stayed at the Vdara Hotel in Las Vegas.  We chose this hotel because of it's location, lack of a casino, and because it looked beautiful and elegant, which it was.  Atmosphere was friendly and staff seemed dedicated to making our stay a success.  . . Now for the downside...unfortunately I left an expensive swimsuit behind upon leaving.  Hung it in the closet in the bathroom to dry.  Called the hotel to report this and had a tough time getting to Lost and Found.  FInally on the 3rd try got an employee who stated he'd check and call me back.  Never did.  Then I emailed guest relations and didn't receive a response for almost 24 hrs.  Very difficult to make contact with anyone to help you with a lost item i.  I was told that my swimsuit could not be located.  Hmmmm, and then was told that they hoped I would be able to locate it.  Really?  How could I do that when it was at the hotel or now more likely in someone's possession that works at the hotel.  . . Surprised that a hotel of this caliber does not have more honest staff working there.  Disappointing to say the least, in their response time and lack of any offer for compensation, and I could have provided a receipt for this.
Consistent and great service.  I would stay here again and again.  First class place.
Do not waste your money.  Sooooo many other options
Vdara is one of the newest additions to Las Vegas' luxury hotels.  It is located at City Center, right off the Strip and is connected to the beautiful Aria.. . This hotel is more quiet than other hotels since it doesn't have a casino.  It does, however, have a lobby bar, a place to get small snacks, and a Starbucks.. . The rooms are gorgeous with amazing views.  My friend and I had a room on the 29th floor with views of Las Vegas Strip South.  The room had a small kitchen with a sink, 2-heater stovetop, a microwave, a mini-bar, and a small refrigerator.  Along with the king-size bed, there was also a sofabed that is fairly comfortable.  The bathroom had a stand-up shower and a jacuzzi tub.. . The room service wasn't all that great.  The maid came to our room but it was still early and we were still asleep/getting ready, so we asked her to come back later.  She never came, for two days, until we called up the housekeeping department and asked if someone could come service our rooms since we were out of towels and toiletries.  What they used to clean the room had a vinegar smell to it that made me so nauseous, so it's wise to not be in the room when they are cleaning!. . Other than the lack of housekeeping service, Vdara is a beautiful and well kept hotel, and I would definitely recommend it.. . One last note, there is a free tram that goes from Aria, Bellagio, and Vdara!
I have stayed here many times. I was coming to Vegas to celebrate my St. Patrick's Day birthday. So I decided to splurge. I got the two bedroom penthouse. This includes a limo to pick you up and take you back to the airport. When we arrived our chauffeur was there. A nice car and a nice chauffeur. When we arrived we went to invited guests check in. The man that assisted us was very nice. What I didn't understand was that they knew we were coming in their limo. Why didn't they have our room ready? They said they would call us when it was ready. We went to lunch and no call. So we went back and the room was ready. Not sure why no call. We go to our room and it was the most disgusting room I've ever been in. The windows were so dirty we couldn't see out of them. Then we found out it was a handicapped room. We felt so sorry for a handicapped person having to stay in this room. I called the front desk and they said that they would get us another room. They said we could wait in this room and when it was ready they would let us know. They sent us up some fruit and water. We waited over an hour. I called down to the front desk and the room was ready. Again no phone call liked told. We went to our room and what a difference. The room was spectacular. Wall to wall windows in every room. When you are paying a high price for a room this is the room you expect. I didn't want to leave the hotel room. Everything is so clean and neat. Just like the first time I stayed here. It looks brand new. The beds are so soft and the sheets are thick and smell so good. I have stayed in the Executive suite, two bedroom loft and now the two bedroom penthouse. They are all great rooms. They don't have a casino and the one complaint I have with the hotel is the walk tothe strip. It's very dangerous and just doesn't look good. They should have built a walkway to the strip and The Cosmo hotel. It's not the cheapest hotel on the strip. But if you like a nice room I would go the extra bucks and get this hotel room. Just don't get the handicapped room.
I thought the lack of a casino floor was going to bum me out but you know what, it didn't matter; I actually like that the place doesn't smell like cigarette buds. Bellagio is right next door and it's connected via a bridge so you can lose your money that way; I sure did =,( Best part of the spacious room was the kitchenette. Boy did it come in handy. What's better than left over Firefly food after a night of drinking?. . There were some minor "flaws," I will say. The refrigerator was tiny. It wasn't deep at all so we had to turn our to-go box vertically to be able to close the door shut. The blackout shades don't really live up to it's name. The edges of the shades don't meet the wall so light still creeps through. The two reading lamps that are above the bed, they don't stay in place where you bend them; they always want to droop, loose screws or something?. . But back to the good yeah? Free WiFi and you actually get cellular data. I don't think I've ever been in a Las Vegas hotel with full bars. SWEET! If you guys want the Vegas treatment but don't mind the further walk or lack of a casino floor beneath your feet, I recommend Vdara.
This has to be my new favorite hotel in vegas. It's brand new and the rooms are HUGE. It also doesn't have any smoky casinos but it's close to the other casino so if you were feening it's a short walk over. it's close to everything so it's awesome! . . our room was HUGE! I can get used to living in a place like that.
**Late Review**. . I stayed at Vdara back in December with my Travel Buddy. We stayed in the Vdara Suite (which ended up being the handicap room) and we loved it! One bedroom with a huge bathroom and a comfortable king bed! Nice living room with a pull out couch. Another bathroom which was handy when it was time to get ready. The kitchen was nice even though we rarely used it (only the fridge to store our liquor he he he). . . Vdara is off the strip but easy access through the City Center tram and connected by a tunnel to the Bellagio.. . I would definitely stay here again, the room was nice and comfortable. BUT I don't recommend staying here when it's cold in Vegas. The walk of shame in the freezing cold back to this hotel is no fun! Especially if you get lost on your way back to the room (only happened one time...I think lol)
We chose Vdara specifically for two reasons: it's entirely smoke-free, and it does not have a casino on its property, which is nice because you don't have to walk through the crowd every time you enter or leave the hotel. Vdara is an excellently designed and decorated, with a Scandinavian feel to it. It promotes itself as eco-friendly, which means no extra towels unless you specifically ask for it, and it houses the "world renowned" ESPA spa & salon (more on this below).. . Our room was generously spacious, comparable to a nice studio apartment in NY. I could live in that space quite comfortably if need be. The room amenities are on par with other hotels on the Strip, and we were pleased. These is a covered walk-way to the nearby Bellagio, and the tram which will go to the Aria. The hotel is just right off the Strip, so access was easy. The restaurants and clubs in the hotel and its sisters are on par with the rest of Vegas.. . I deduct a star for these reasons:. . - The pool was closed. We could use the pool at its sister's hotel next door, the Aria. But walking outdoor to a different property was not enticing. (There was no indoor path to the Aria.). . - We called the concierge desk to help us get ticket to a Cirque de Soleil show at the Aria and was transferred to the ticket desk for the show. We could have done that ourselves.. . - The ESPA spa was way overpriced, even by Vegas standards. The service was not amazing, though the facility was very nice. There was no coed area where the two of us can enjoy the hot tub or spa together. There was a common waiting area as we waited to be called for our massages.
Amazing rooms. Full bath, glass enclosed shower. Hey, I like baths - what can i say?  The suites are large and the bathroom is almost as big as other hotel rooms. Modern, chic aesthetic with auto-shades on windows and great views. Good dining in the Aria - which you will likely go through getting out to the strip. Deals to be found through Expedia or Hotwire (via their 'Mystery 5 star hotel' choices on the strip'). They consider this on the strip, however many people would not as it sits back a bit...kind of behind the Aria.
I love you Vdara!  I love you for your aesthetically pleasing interior architecture, clean lines and design.  I love you for the beautiful view of the pool from my room window.  I love your impeccable service and friendly staff.  I love that you don't have a casino downstairs and there is no odor of smoke within the building.  I love your spa, where I enjoyed the best deep tissue massage by JJ.  Most of all, I love your gym, which I couldn't live without.  . . I am not a gal who is enthralled by Vegas.  In fact, Vegas, is not generally a destination I would choose to visit, but after my stay at the Vdara, I have been converted.  I love the Vdara and it made my Vegas vacation a getaway I can't wait to repeat.
Too many reviews already, so I'll hit the highlights:. . Love - wifi included in resort fee, nice gym, smoke free, casino free, easy access to Aria & Bellagio, super comfy beds, great rooms & views . Boo - resort fee ($25 daily + a $3 TAX on the resort fee), limited & expensive food options, pool closes by 6:00 (???)
Amazing. Loved it really! The service was great, everyone was nice and polite, all of them willing to help out! The room that I got was absolutely amazing! haha the view was incredible and I enjoyed that the most. I enjoyed the design of the room and it was very elegant and clean looking. I definitely loved the bathroom design and it was actually the design I was gonna remodel my bathroom to. . . There's actually no smoke at the Vdara and no casino, so it's great for children and families. The only thing they have is a little bar near the front entranceand elevators but that's about it. . . Overall the service was amazing, the rooms amazing, my room view amazing, and I would definitely go back if I am ever in vegas again.
I thought I would've liked the idea of getting away from getting second hand smoke in the casinos, but I realized being in vegas, that kind of comes with the domain ya know?  Kinda missed that when I stayed here. Another thing is that there's no direct self parking, it's the city center parking and it's a bit of a walk so I just did valet which was a nightmare as well, you're going around in circles and circles hoping you finally land in front of the right hotel (i obviously missed it the first night).  . . The rooms are really nice, a kitchen though they didn't come with cooking stuff, I think you have to request those.  They had plenty of outlets by the bed, YAY!  BUT one thing that did really irk me was the switches.  There's a master switch...by the door...so you have to kind of maneuver yourself in the dark after you turn the lights off...unless I am an idiot and didn't know how to work the lights, which is also possible but I am pretty sure they were powered by the master switch only.  . . I didn't get a chance to but they do have an amazing bath to bathe in...it's humongous! definitely wouldn't want a "What Lies Beneath" situation in that tub!. Overall, I think I would still prefer Bellagio or Aria, just because it's so much easier to find the location and there's more options for things around those hotels.  But it's not a bad place, and if you do hate the crazy scenes of the casino, you should definitely check this one out.
Awesome place to be away from Vegas, Vegas if you know what I mean. It's sleek, well designed and free of smoke and gaming. I know, I know I am taking all of the fun outta Vegas - but hey Vdara is a nice place. . If you are in town for business, Vdara is perfect! You'll be able to focus, and you can show up at your meetings without a cigarette odor. . . Vdara delivers nice views, great design, and superb service. I recommend this hotel for families, business travelers and non-smokers.
This is a really nice, clean, smoke-free hotel in City Center.  It doesn't have the flash of Aria or the Cosmopolitan, but it is a really nice option for that part of the Strip. All of the people that worked there were super friendly as well. Our room was really spacious and had a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.  One complaint would be that the in-room refrigerator only kept our food cool not cold.  Also, while the pool is really nice, it is not the scene that you may be seeking while in Las Vegas.  The Starbucks in the lobby is also an added bonus.
Just don't stay here.  We chose this property for the smoke free and gambling free aspects so we would feel comfortable with our daughter.  There are no good restaurants and the pool was so windy they sent us to Aria.  Aria had a way better pool, but there was smoking and not another kid.  In fairness, the whole cheapo, weekend gettaway, family vacay during our daughters Spring Break was a bad idea.  Kids are just not a great idea for Vegas, despite all the kid friendliness that is suggested online.
