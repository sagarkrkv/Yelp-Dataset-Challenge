What can I say I'm a huge fan of MGM properties and well Mandalay bay is amazing. The hotel on the other hand is a bit more luxurious and spacious. With it's classy feel you don't forget your in Las Vegas with an amazing lounge called the mix lounge you don't have to go far to have a good time! They also have there recently opened light night club which is nice space with amazing performers.  One note they do need more djs like there family hotel MGM at hakkasan.
We booked a room at the Mandalay Bay via expedia. Be careful, the 25$ hotel fee for the wifi and cardio room is not included and you have totake it.  No big deal for me, since I wanted the wifi anyway. While checking in, the lady at the desk asked us if we wanted to upgrade to a suite for an extra 30$ a night, which we agreed to (why not!). If you are not a big party goer, you might be annoyed by the fact that the night club is at the top of the hotel. There is a lot of circulation at night in the elevators because of that and if your room is on the same side as the club's balcony (like ours was), don't expect to go to sleep before 3am... But why would you anyway, you're in Vegas!. . The room was nice and clean, the bed was soft but comfy and all of the staff (desk, concierge, the store) were great. Plus, the fact that it is at the very end of the strip makes it a little bit more quiet (minus the club), but you will walk a lot!
Had THEsuite with two queens for a two night stay for my friends bday and everything was perfect. The location of the hotel is at the south end of the strip allowing an awesome view of the entire downtown Vegas if your facing north. It's connected to the Mandalay Bay so you can enjoy the clubs and amenities of the entire resort. . . Our room was on the 33rd floor with an incredible view. The rooms are awesome with a huge bathroom with large soaking tub separate from the shower, his/her sinks, separate toilet room, and wall mounted tv. . . The bedroom has his/her closets, floor to ceiling windows, and plenty of storage for all your clothes. . . The separate living room has a nice large sofa, chair, desk, wet bar, floor to ceiling window, large LCD TV, and a separate half bathroom. . . Everything was awesome at this hotel. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The lobby smelled so good too! Lol!
The room is clean, but the place is beat up.  The toilet paper holder is falling off the wall, the bed linens are torn, walls/furniture are beat up and the TVs are old with a non-HD picture.  Not the best room I have stayed in here.
Nicolas is the best bellhop! I will write more when I'm not half asleep.  Everything went really well, after our last experience which wasn't as good. But everything was great, the staff, the help, the room amazing.  Beautiful view, and suite. Love this place!
I was hoping to have a good splendid stay here but instead I received the opposite. First upon arrival there was a strong odor of marijuana. I called the front desk and asked for them to take care of it and hopefully offer to switch rooms. They didn't do they. They offered to have someone come up to febreeZe it and that was never done. Also we left to enjoy Vegas and when we came back the house keeping didn't change the towels and took a dump in our toilet. And how do I know they took a dump?  Poo stain on the seat was visible. I was grossed out and vowed to not ever book at this pseudo 5 star hotel.
I'll admit, this is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at while in Vegas.  While walking from self-parking through the casino area to the reception desk (I took the long way), I noticed the air didn't reek of smoke.  Everything was aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  I don't know if it matters but I booked a room at THEhotel through Priceline.  Obviously I wasn't expecting a top-floor suite, however, I don't like being treated like riff raff.  The guy at the desk was friendly enough but as I was checking in for my 4-night stay (I came on a Thursday around 5pm) I was informed that my request for a king bed room couldn't be fulfilled and that I'd be getting a double queen.  I thought it was ridiculous for him to ask "Is that ok?"  No, it's not, but what choice do I have other than to go elsewhere?  I totally wanted to go to Vegas to sleep in separate beds from my lover (sarcasm intended).  While this was happening, I overhear the couple next to me checking in being told the same thing.  They didn't complain either BUT their guest service rep offered to move them to a king bed room the next day, if one became available...where was my offer for such?  So I take my keys and go check out the room while I sadly explain to my other half that we would be sleeping separately.  The room was nicely decorated and mostly clean (except for the mold growing in the top corners of the shower, yuck) and the beds were comfortable.  I'm not sure if I had any neighbors because I didn't hear anything through the walls.  That's all that saved this from a one-star review.. . The icing to this cake was opening the curtains to find a wall and an ugly roof for my view.  Thanks for giving me an expensive place to sleep separate from my S.O. with nothing nice to look at.  It's nice but I wouldn't come back here again.  For a few bucks less, I'd go back to the Monte Carlo for the sub par room but better treatment and views (which I also booked through Priceline two years ago).
Great rooms, We had a living room and a bedroom with one and a half baths and even a TV in the master bath, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay for my boyfriends birthday.  A bit far to walk down the strip but the Mandalay Bay and the adjoining hotels have plenty to do.
The Average Hotel !!!. $25/day as resort fee (not included while booking). After I checked out, saw an extra charge of $150 on my credit card statement. Had to call their customer service number & waited about 30mins to get someone on, they did some verification & told me that it was an error !!! really ? Anyway, they returned that charge back to my card. Average room in Strip hotel, noise level is very high, you can hear neighbors & people in the corridor (not sure if this problem was only on 27th floor). If you find it really cheap comparing to other strip hotels, go for it. If not, there are many better ones.
Worst hotel. TV in my room is from the 90's and makes a radiating noise. They call this room a suite....
After all these years, I still have a soft spot in my heart for The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. I am going to miss it very much, but I am also excited for what it is going to transform into.... The Delano.  I went to The Delano when I was in Miami and it was absolutely stunning.  . . What I like about THEhotel the most is the tranquil environment it embodies.  It's attached to the Mandalay Bay via a long corridor, so you have the casino action right at your fingertips, but the exclusiveness of a boutique hotel.  Everyone here is friendly and polite.... Something you would expect from a AAA Four Diamond property.. . The rooms are all suites and absolutely amazing.  The living room comes complete with a couch, huge flat screen TV and a workstation overlooking the Vegas skyline. A separate  restroom and mini-bar, complete with sink round out the entrance....... . Now, the good part..... The bedroom.  Plush robes, slippers, bathtub for two and a shower with the perfect amount of water pressure..... Another bathroom is inside a water closet and the vanity and sinks are his/hers..... or his/his & hers/hers.... Whatever you may prefer!. . THE BED......DEAD......HEAVEN.  The bed is one of the most comfortable beds you will ever sleep in.  The room has the slightest bit of wear and tear, but it's clean and very spacious.... . . If you're coming to Vegas between now and the fall of 2014, book your room at THEhotel inside Mandalay Bay.
We've stayed here before, about 4 years ago, and I'm pretty sure nothing has been updated. The room was nice and clean but very dated - they still have tube based, flat screen TVs. Our room was on the 12th floor, facing the freeway and parking lot, and we could hear the traffic from our room. Also, they allow pets (they say all on one floor - not the floor we were on) and Sunday morning we could hear a single dog barking in the distance for about 30 minutes. . Not sure what the other rooms look like, we were placed in a handicap access room, as we wanted to be closer to the elevators. It was like a micro-suite, with an entrance room with a 1/2 bath, couch, desk, bar/sink area and a door separating it from the bedroom. We had a king sized bed, very comfortable and a large bathroom with both a tub w/a shower and a roll-in stand up shower. Nice to have the two rooms, but they were small (even though the bed and bathroom were large). As mentioned, I was surprised they still had tube TVs. Really would have expected LCD or LED TVs at a hotel of this level. . If we stay here again, we'll ask for a higher floor, hoping that will reduce the outside noise. The staff was friendly but we did get four wake up calls when we only requested two. The AC/heater unit worked great, pretty quite for a hotel (might have nice if it was louder to drown out the outside noise!). Elevators were fast and smooth, although not very big. There is plenty of self parking but it can get very crowded on a weekend, not only because it's part of Mandalay Bay but also because there are a couple of very popular clubs for the hip and pretty party crowd. Best way to enter is from Frank Sinatra drive, it's pretty dark in the garage (probably keeping with the hip theme), but they do have roof top parking if it gets full. . Honestly, if it wasn't for the hotel offer we received, I wouldn't pick this based on the current room decor and price. If they update the rooms, I'd reconsider. . Overall, fine place to stay if you get a great offer, if you have to pay retail, I'd recommend you look elsewhere.
This place is fabulous and I should give it 5 stars.  The suite is amazing.  A modern full size living room and full size bedroom.  The bath has a hot tube.  Oh yeah!  When I checked in, my name was on the LCD displays making me feel like a VIP.  The parking valet is just downstairs and convenient.  The rooms themselves is a 5.  But there were some minor inconveniences that made me lower the rating.  First, it isn't close to the casino.  A very long walk in a corridor that has a creepy feel at nights (since you're the only one in it).  Then no restaurants are part of it.  You have to go back in the casino.  Then the location of the casino.  Nothing is around it.  Sure you can walk to the small boring Luxor or take a tram to Excalibur which is dated and tacky.  I prefer mid-strip where you can walk to numerous casinos, shops and restaurants.  The room is not enough for me to come back here, unless I get comp, which I won't since I'm not a premium member of their rewards program.
One word- DISGUSTING ! I was on a business trip last week and was working at the convention center, so I figured it would be easiest to stay at the Mandalay bay as well. . . First, after a long flight,  I got to the front desk and they tell me that since they are "so booked" they moved my room to THEhotel... after trekking to THEhotel... I finally get to my room and it smelled like throw up. I was absolutely disgusted.... I walked over to the bed and found a large black hair on the pillow on the bed. Then, there was puke all over the comforter. I was HORRIFIED. . . I called the desk services and they moved me to another room. I had to wait for 10 minutes. The front desk barely apologized. I then got to my new room and immediately went to check the bed. There, i found large clumps of hair in the bed. It was appalling. . . I called the desk services again and they did not seem to care. They told me they could send housekeeping to remove the hair. I was absolutely disgusted that I ended up cancelling my entire room and ended up getting a nicer room all the way on the other end of the strip.. . I work in the events/exhibits industry and will make sure to tell everyone I know about this terrible experience. It doesn't seem like  they clean their rooms at this place, let alone care if there is throw up on their beds.
I come to vegas every other week for business and usually stay at the Mandalay. When I asked the front desk attendant if there were any upgrade rooms available, she said I could get a suite in "The" for 40 bucks...  I sstay here every time, you think they would just say "we value you, and are going to comp the fee", but never.. . I don't like Mandalay Bay (proper) anymore because its just too noisy on the floors and thought this might be a good change, and in between meetings, get some work done.. . . So the good... The rooms are cool, two bathrooms, a living room and then another room with a bedroom and a master bath. State of the art TV's, internet, all that good stuff.. The bed, is nice and firm and I got a good sleep. Big towels, can't go wrong, Im a big guy.. . Now the bad.. . For hotels I have 3 rules... Comfortable Bed, Quiet, Good Shower Head.... This place gets ONE.. . The bed, i talked about... Good stuff.. . I don't know whats wrong with Mandalay properties but there is constant banging going on, mostly from the room service staff in the morning. Put the DND sign up, they still knock... WTF... Noises in the rooms above, below, next to you, this place has walls as thin as rice paper.. . The shower head... I get water conservation, im a big fan, but it strikes me as ironic that you can go to some of the restaurants and see the water on full blast all night to MELT ice from the raw bars... Using water to melt water.. Yes its a health control, but when your 6"5 and get into a shower and it takes you 5 minutes to get soaked, I wonder how much water could be saved with a normal flow with a shorter shower. And yes there are realities of fluid dynamics (how do you get a fininite number of gallons of water to hundreds of rooms), but its a bummer.. . Don't get me wrong, the place is A-OK and worth experiencing.. Mandalay is a great 5-star resort but its attention to details that I think they are falling down on.. . Opening the door to room service and having to point to the do not disturb light makes me think I know more about the property than they do. Perhaps also, being a bit more ginger with opening and closing some of the doors at 8am in the morning might make this a quieter place...
I was just here for work, we set up a party in the Lupo.  This hotel is sooooo pretty!!! Clean and kept up.  Can not wait to go back when I am not working!!! Love this hotel.  Great valet service, though their carport is a bit confussing thats really no biggie.
