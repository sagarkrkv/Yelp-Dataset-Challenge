Sat down to breakfast with a co-worker here last week. Ordered pretty standard bacon and eggs, coffee (great coffee!) and small glasses of OJ. . . Right after my buddy drains his OJ, the waitress came by with a pitcher of it and asked, "Would you like some more?" Very attentive! He proceeds to continue draining OJs (it was a late night) with our waitress very quick to come by and refill. What service! . . The bill is dropped off and we see it has eclipsed $40. WHA??? Those OJ refills - $4 a pop. . . Welcome to Vegas.
Let me start by saying I don't like corn beef hash. The corn beef hash here was more like a braised short rib with poached eggs and potatoes- it's one of the best breakfast dishes I've ever eaten. Love their bread and coffee also.The service was great. the food was awesome -what more could you ask for on a Saturday morning in Vegas
Love their Sunday Brunch...late winter, early spring is one of the best times to have brunch there outdoors on their patio
Awesome location! Awesome food! Good gluten free menu and helpful wait staff. Come here for one meal every time we come to Vegas.
I would give 4 stars for foods go but service is okay.. I felt that we been ignored because the way we dress.  We dressed very casual since we only  going to be Vegas for one day on 8 days bus tour to Yellowstone. I wanted my family to enjoyed some good foods since we haven't for last 6 days. So I made reservation thru open table 3 hours before.. which I glad I did.. I could see there was long wait. I can't remember exactly what I order but I know it goods.  I would go back there if I am in town
went there Dec 2011 and enjoyed a pretty good old fashioned french cuisine. . service was fine. . prices were decent. . quality was right
We heard great things about Mon Ami Gabi, so we decided to try it for dinner. They gave is complimentary fresh warm baguette with room temp butter. Pretty good, we asked for a second loaf. We started with appetizers and ordered the Escargots. Omg, they were so good. The garlic herb butter that the escargots was seasoned with were amazing. The snails were juicy and very tasty. We all loved it so much we ordered another two... And used up all the complimentary bread by soaking up the delicious garlic herb butter! I ordered the mushroom soup and the hanger steak. Both were just OK. The soup was really bland, had no flavor at all. Hanger steak was alright, also lacked flavor. I think most people rave about their breakfast/brunch menu, so I'll probably have to come back to give Mon Ami Gabi another try for breakfast... That's if I can wake up early enough.. Saying noone sleeps earlier than 4am when in Vegas!
They take no reservations for outside. Depending on the time of day or evening the wait could be as long as 90 minutes, sometimes more.. Here is my secret. After you give your name at the front, go directly out back were is another bar. Usually standing room only but the people watching is great. You will notice some of the asst. managers walking around in suits...Let him or her know that you have made a reservation and slip them a nice gratuity saying you would be very happy if they could help you... It has been done for years and it still works. It's not a guarantee but I have been pleased with the results.. . Outside is great, very crowded, close sitting...but some of the best people watching in the city.
Entering Paris hotel and casino? Immediately turn left and you'll find this little gem that is great for brunch! Sit out on the patio overlooking the Bellagio fountain show rather than sitting indoors (which is pretty dim). If you are here before 11AM, the fountain show is only once or twice an hour, so be warned.. . They have juicy mimosas and bloody marys accented nicely with particularly fresh celeries, but their bloody marys look watery rather than the thick consistency you would expect from the tomato liquor. Anyhow, sweet and salty cravings can be satisfied here with their perfectly done eggs any way you like them (omelettes, poached, eggs benedict--yum!) or delectable french toast. The french toast...it is a beauty, crunchy outside and stretchy/fluffy inside with blueberries dancing atop. The blueberry syrup is not syrup at all, but a puree. Make sure the bite you take with your fork has a good proportion of toast, powdered sugar, whipped cream, blueberries, and blueberry syrup.
Mon Ami Gabi has got it all... Location, Ambiance, and Delicious Food.  This is our go to restaurant in Vegas mostly because they have THE BEST FILET THAT LIFE HAS TO OFFER.  It's cooked perfectly every time, the sauce is amazing, and it comes with a side of "you think there's a lot, but somehow you're gonna put them all away" pommes frite.  And while you wait for your amazing piece of beef, you can enjoy delicious French bread, some nice wine, the Bellagio fountain view, and hopefully you will be wise enough to order the French Onion Soup as well.  . . I don't know what took me so long to write this review, but after coming back this past weekend, I knew it was time.  . . I probably should have written it 3 years ago when we had our wedding dinner here for 70 guests and it was flawless.  Every single entree came out perfectly, the servers didn't miss a beat, and everyone truly enjoyed themselves.  To quote one of my guests, "This steak is so good, I would snort it if I could."  . . The planning process for our wedding event was also handled fantastically by the coordinators and they were so accommodating to the OCD, nutty bride that I had briefly become.. . P.s. It's good for breakfast and lunch too!
If you've ever wanted to try escargo, this is a great place to do it! The other food is good too, & it's fun to sit out on the terrace and people watch (since it's on the strip).
Very Impressed!!!
Amazing view to Bellagio fountain show if you seat outside, the service ok but the food...tho not horrible tasting, steak is pretty awesome BUT both times I ate there I ended up in the hospital...yeah! Intense so when I was forced to go there again for a third time and refused to eat anything my friend who did eat the same awesome steak ended up in the hospital...what's wrong w their food?!!
Stopped in here for some cocktails and apps yesterday. This place has a great location next to the Paris hotel. There is lots of outdoor seating as well. I had a couple of the French martinis, which were very tasty without skimping on the booze. . . They provide a complimentary baguette with butter and an apple flavored cole slaw. It sounds weird but the butter and slaw combination is actually very delicious! My husband and I also shared a side of frites. The portion size was good and the fries were yummy.
We made areservation here for 2 and from start to finish everything was wonderful!  We got an edge seat right across from the fountain, so we got to see 3 fountain shows during dinner.  The waitstaff was kind enough to take photos for us with the fountain in the back.  The waitstaff work really well as a team so you are always attended to.  Katrina was our waitress.... super service and very knowledgable of the wine list.  My husband and I would come here again.  Portions are adequate.... not too big so you can actually finish your meal but not small so that you would leave hungry.  Excellent value.
What an adorable place for a lunch or brunch! If your timing is good or if you're willing to wait, the patio is the perfect place to enjoy your meal. Unfortunately, the patio was closed for a private event when I was there. . . My family and I stopped by for a Sunday lunch/brunch. Their menu has a good variety of items so everyone should be able to find something they want. That morning, the warm chicken and brie sandwich was calling my name and I had to answer. I loved my sandwich! It was warm and creamy from the brie, sweet from the caramelized onions, and a bit tart from the green apples. I think I may have to re-create this combination at home! Accompanying my sandwich was a cone full of their fries. I'm not sure if I'd call them fries though. They were flat and wider than other fries which made them crispy in some places. It was more of a cross between a fry and a chip, a "frip" if you will. . . I also sampled the croque monsieur and the chicken and mushroom crepe from my family members. Both were tasty as well! My one complaint is that the butter that came with our demi baguette was cold. Why was it cold? The bread wasn't warm so the cold butter didn't make sense. . . For a nice restaurant on the Vegas strip, the prices seemed pretty reasonable. The space was a bit cramped though. Be prepared to potentially bump elbows with the person at the next table.
Great restaurant... A friend recommended this restaurant to me and I was not led astray! I ordered the duck confit, the special of the night (medallions wrapped in bacon) and a Shirley Temple! Duck confit was amazing the best I've had! The bar was great, the bartender never let my drink get low and the view was awesome! I sat at the bar and had a great view of the Bellagio fountain show!
One of my very favorite restaurants!  I will drive down to The Strip just to go and sit on the patio and watch the fountains at Bellagio.  Its a quaint bistro type french restaurant.  The food is fantastic too and well priced.  The Bloody Mary Buffet is the best ever with about 20 items including beef jerky!  Well worth the trip.
Looking for a great place to eat with a nice view that won't cost you an arm and a leg?  This is definitely a great place. We booked through OpenTable a week in advance and were seated right away. Though we weren't seated on the patio, we still had a fairly good view of the Bellagio fountains. The food was good also. Steak, escargot, fries, bread, wine all for about $125.. . This is Vegas... Do not try to walk in on Friday night without reservations.
Always have good experiences here!
By far one of my favorite restaurants, in Las Vegas and overall. I ate at Mon Ami before I started Yelping, and I realized I never left them my review. I miss this place, be sure to stop in for brunch or a nice dinner when you're aain town.. . The duck confit is simply divine. If you're in the mood for soup, everything is absolutely delicious. My personal favorites are the obvious, French onion, and potato leek. The potato leek soup is smooth, and a perfect blend of flavors. Any of their sandwiches are a good choice, beef dip and another with chicken and caramelized onions were both super delish. If you're in the mood for brunch, I highly recommend their waffles or an eggs Benedict (crab is yummers). They had an awesome bloody mary bar the last time I stopped in...take advantage if you enjoy them.. . The service has always been wonderful. On nice days there is an outdoor patio, but the inside ambiance is also enjoyable. Dimly lit, pretty romantic. If you are undecided or have no clue about the menu, the servers here will help you find something. They always have made recommendations to me, even on the wine. Worth a visit, I recommend this restaurant to anyone in Vegas!
We went on a Saturday morning, 1030ish. We really wanted to sit in the patio so we chose to wait. They quoted 45 minutes but it ended up only being about a 25 minute wait. And, it was worth it! The view was incredible & the people watching was even better. We had a great view of Jungle Josh -magician, comedian, hot mess, etc. rofl. It was pretty hilarious. The food was good, eggs Benedict for me & corned beef hash for my friend. We both enjoyed the experience. We attempted to go back again Sunday morning but the patio was closed for a private party. I would definitely recommend this place based on the view itself. They were swamped with people so the service wasn't the best but it was ok. I definitely plan to go back.
Awesome European style cafe on the Vegas Strip. Had dinner and wine with my wife at a street side table while in Vegas for a trade show.  Watched the Bellagio fountains 5 times during dinner which added to the exceptional dining experience.  Add Mon Ami Gabi to your dining plans when in Vegas.
I have been there for breakfast, nice view of the strip and fountains of bellagio, romantic seating , food is ok not the best i ever had, good service. they are always busy
Had lunch here today with a couple friends. Was nice out so we sat outside at the bar and were attentively taken care of by a guy named Robert, who was fantastic! Had a few appetizers and a sandwich. I had the endive and Roquefort salad along with a warm goat cheese dip with toasted bread. Both were amazing. The people I was with had french martinis which were terrific as they were recommended by Robert. We ended with profiterouls and a chocolate pecan bar and an espresso martini. Everything was great. Thanks for a nice lunch.
This was one of the best meals I have ever had, hands down. And now I will be returning every time I go to Vegas!. I made reservations for a birthday dinner by the front windows. When we arrived for our reservation, the hostess said we would have to wait 15-20 minutes for the window. SO worth the wait. We played on the slot machines right in front until the buzzer went off only 2 minutes later. . Our hostess was so friendly and we got a full conversation in by the time we were seated. That never happens! She was also able to give us a gluten free menu for one of the members of the group. We were promptly given warm french bread in a cute baguette holder and the server gave the friend gluten free bread without even asking! That is a perfect way to get customers to return! . . For an appetizer we got the baked goat cheese with tomato sauce and garlic bread. We should have ordered these individually because it was heaven on a plate. Everything about this dish had me wanting more.. For steak frites (what else would you order), I got the Bordelaise with wine sauce and onions cooked medium-rare. This was a large, tender piece of meat with a pile of fries and plenty of caramelized onions. They really get their portions right! My friends got the Bernaise steak frites and that sauce was pretty spectacular as well. . For dessert, we got the profiteroles and I am convinced they imported them straight from France. Again, amazing. I highly recommend! Only weird thing about the meal was that they did nothing for the friends birthday, so I am assuming there was a lack of communication between the hostess and the server.. . Total was around $60 a person for steak, appetizer, dessert, and split bottle of wine. For Vegas, and how great this meal was, that was a fantastic deal.. Oh and while this is all going on, the Bellagio fountains are going off every 15 minutes right in front of us.
Uhm, total waste of money. don't listen to all of the hype.. it's a total waste. made reservations 2 weeks in advance and still had to wait at an overcrowded bar for 20 minutes. my girl  friend got the classique steak and eh, it was alright. I got the fish & frites and the local market could do it better.  go eat at Marilyn's cafe instead. so disappointed in Mon Ami Gabi, was really looking forward to a great experience. it's all just a scheme.
It's a great place if you can sit outside in good weather.
We (my boyfriend and I, both in our 30's from Silicon Valley) stayed at the Bellagio across the street and were not happy with the prices and atmosphere in our hotel. . . We saw the good reviews for this place and decided to try it. We were not disappointed! . . We ate here for both dinner (Saturday night) and brunch (Monday morning), both were fantastic, reasonably priced, great service and atmosphere. . The food of course was also great.. . We got a reservation for both times, and we were seated right away. So grateful for this place.
Overpriced food, it didn't taste that good. (Maybe because I was hungover) . However- the view right in front of Bellagio fountain! That makes up for everything.
For brunch, for dinner, for a date, with a group - I always love it here!  Bloody Mary bar at brunch is great.  Always love the quiche.  And the steak frites.  Always one of my favorites on the strip!
To me this is just not worth the money given so many other great options on the strip. I have been here 4-5 times since it was one of my GF's favorite restaurants (it is one of the Lettuce Entertain You places if you are a rewards member with them). . . Most of the time I got Steak Frites. The cut of steak you get is pounded very thin and to my taste always overcooked- despite ordering medium rare it always comes grey throughout, so that is a pretty big deal breaker. The fries themselves are ok, they are the very thin style, and you do get an insane amount of them. The steak, however, should be the star of this meal and it just isn't.. . The one time I didn't get steak I got  a scallop entree and this was much better than the steak- the scallops were seared well and came with a nice sauce- if you go I would highly recommend this over the steak. . . Some random other items I have had. . French Onion soup- this is ok but honestly if you are accustomed to french onion soup at a steakhouse you probably won't like it- itis much more subtle than what we have come to expect from the dish in America. . Escargots- very good but VERY garlic tasting, hopefully if you are getting this you aren't on a date.. . Duck Confit- This was pretty clumsily done and dissapointing. . Whipped Cauliflower- this is actually pretty good- esp if you are trying to avoid potatoes for health reasons this is the side for you. . Macaroni Gratin- nothing special, best had elsewhere on the strip . . . . Ambiance- Many people like sitting outside as you get a good view of people walking the strip and the Bellagio fountains so if the weather is amenable I would recommend that.
This place is awesome!  actually ended up eating dinner here twice on my 3-day trip to Vegas last month. Nothing beats sitting on the patio, overlooking the strip.. Great views & great people-watching! Thoroughly enjoyed a steak frites plate on my first visit.. The strip steak was cooked to perfection and the fries were delicious.  On my second visit I enjoyed Gabi's martini, which was terrific. The highlight of all my time at Mon Ami Gabi? The baked goat cheese! Absolutely, hands-down the best dish out there. The flatbread, the sauce, and the cheese make the perfect combo. Only wish it was served with more bread!  I also had the caesar salad and an order of 6 oysters on the half shell which were in special that night... Everything was great! A very memorable evening, can't wait to return!
Delish food, great atmosphere and lots of fun!  Mon Ami Gabi would be a great place for a first date!!
Decent food.  Service is average at best.
We had a group of folks who had a reservation here. We were seated quickly on the patio and got some amazing seats. This steakhouse has excellent menu items and I would recommend it to others. I had classic steak which was amazing. The fries are excellent and to top it off the chocolate mousse was yummy.
I was waiting for a friend and stopped by for lunch here. Had to wait 40min for an outdoor table but totally worth it to see the bellagio fountains across the street, had the lobster roll on brioche bun, it was the best one I've ever had. Very reasonable drinks and lunch for myself was around $30
Oh my heavens... One of my favorite places to eat on the strip! Starting with the atmosphere, Mon Ami is located in Paris and the view across the street of the Bellagio fountains at night really sets the mood right. If it's warmer, I highly recommend sitting outside. The service is always very good and the waitstaff is extremely knowledgable.. . Now onto what's most important: the food! Beginning with appetizers, the duck confit is to die for! I've had lots of duck in my life, but this is by far some of the best. It's extremely tenderand melts in your mouth. Main course: Get the bone-in ribeye!! I have tried a few different steaks here, but this one tops it off! The bone just adds SO much flavor to the already amazingly marbleized piece of steak! It is cooked to perfection every time! And lastly, dessert: the French sure do know what they are doing!! The bananas fosters is DIVINE!! It's the perfect balance of sweetness to top your meal off. An amazing meal with a wonderful wine selection to go with a great view... What more could you ask for?!
Our stop everytime we come to Vegas.  Love their filet mignon with merlot butter and hanger steak is delicious too.  This time I tried their beat and goat cheese salad....perfect blend of sweet and salty taste each ingredient all around.  We had a party of four and half our party came late.  They wouldn't seat us until our whole party arrived.  I was worried our reservation would get canceled because they were nearly 30 minutes late past our reservation, but they seated us during prime time.   Thank you once again for a wonderful time.  Until next time.
The food is excellent here! The French Onion soup is to die for, the fish and steak is so delicious, French fries yum. Salads are so good. Wanted to stay longer in Vegas so I could eat here more often!
I have eaten lunch here on past visits to Vegas but this was my first time havingbreakfast. It was so good! I had the eggs florentine and I ate every last bit. I probably would have licked the plate if I wasn't in public. Service was great as well.
Vegas isn't Vegas if I don't have my Mon Ami Gabi! It's such a great spot for whatever mood you're in and you can't beat the view in the pavillion or on the patio looking out towards the Bellagio Fountain!. . I've only done brunch here and always, without a doubt order their eggs benedict with tomato and spinach.....love it! If I feel bad, I will order waffles and their muffin! Believe me, I am not pigging out alone on those carbs!. . Mon Ami Gabi's service is always on cue and I haven't experienced bad service.  The service is attentative, water is always filled, and we get seated in little to no time! . . I recently tried the bellini and it was quite refreshing, I will be ordering that again. I always tell myself to explore their menu, but my heart goes to the benies! So maybe one day when I feel like eating out of the box, I will try something different.
I was staying at the Paris Hotel with my mom and we didn't want to walk too far for dinner, so we decided to try Mon Ami Gabi.  The entire experience was  incredible!  I had the seared scallops and they were cooked to perfection, the service was great, and so was the ambiance.  Afterwards we went over to The Bellagio to watch the water show.  Overall great experience without having to battle the crowds on the strip.
Looking for something different went down the strip to find something new and happened upon this place.  Figured I would give it a shot and try it.. . They got me in very quickly ( party of 1 so not much wait) and was seated.  Started with a nice glass of red wine and they brought out warm bread and a carrot salad.  Normally I'm not find of carrots but this changed my mind, it was great in the bread.. . I ordered the salmon and it was one of the best cooked pieces of salmon I have had.  Many places overcook the salmon but this was done just right. . . The menu had a good mix of steaks, fish, and chicken offerings so there should be something for everybody.   Moderately priced for Vegas so it was a great value.  Definitely will be one of my stops next time I'm in Vegas.
One of the best restaurants in town for a first date.  It doesn't wreck your wallet, but the service and quality of food is stellar.  It's got a great view, and the menu just feels fancy.  If you are struggling with ideas on where to eat, make this place a top 5 choice.
Best bread in the world, better than Paris itself.. . Yummy steak, good frites, and how can you go wrong people watching and a front row view of the Bellagio fountains?!
Very delicious breakfast. The food quality is great, location is prime and comparably reasonable prices!
I love this place!  It is one of my favorites restaurants in Las Vegas.  Food and Wine are always great.  Whether we get fish or steak it is always done to perfection. . .Try the awsome merlot butter with your fillet.  YUM  YUM.   The view of the Bellagio fountains just ads to the experience.
The food was of excellent quality, but sometimes lacked a little forethought. My daily special tuna was encrusted with way too much pepper. However, they have an excellent wine selection and fabulous waitstaff.
This is a place to go to enjoy one of the few sidewalk dining options in Vegas that isn't trashy and for a target audience that is a lot younger and rowdier than my demographic. The food is good, the service was generally attentive, and it is a good spot to enjoy the Strip view. . . Considering the number of meals they serve on a busy weekend afternoon, it is better than one would expect. We went with a friend that is a highly regarded French chef. He could tell where they cut some culinary corners, but at the same time, given how many people they serve on a peak day he was impressed with how well they do what they do. Given the number of covers, it's not going to be perfect, but it is good for where it is and the size of the crowd on a nice, sunny Saturday afternoon.. . The wait staff was pleasant and generally attentive. Given that it's Vegas and everything is a show, it was amusing that our French accented waiter was in fact just adding to the allure. If you speak French, don't assume the waiter does...
I came here with a friend after we saw the Celine Dion concert. We had reservations for 10:30 and they seated us immediately. We ordered the Warm Brie for an appetizer and it was delicious. Both of us ordered steak. It was cooked well and had surprisingly large portions compared to the small amount of brie we got as an appetizer. We sat close to the patio and the experience of being able to watch the Bellagio fountains while we ate made it a fun experience! Don't miss out on dessert! We tried the white chocolate bread pudding and it was to die for.
Taking price into consideration, the food here is nothing exceptional...greasy French bistro stuff. But the view from the patio is exceptional for people-watching! It faces right out onto the Vegas Strip, so you'll get an eyeful of the wacky passers-by and street freaks, with the occasional spouting of the Bellagio fountains across the street to liven things up.. . If there are no seats available on the patio, however...no dice. The food isn't worth coming here without the view.
Fab meal as per usual.  Dover sole was divine.  Our waiter, Dean, was a genuine treat.  Love the St Germaine cocktail carafes.  The check in process is goofy with folks without resos clogging the line for those with resos.  But, the desk is usually efficient.  The prices are in line. The food is consistently good. Patio seating is highly coveted and hard to secure. Only disappointment is that they took the salted caramel ice cream off the dessert menu so I couldn't request it with the Bananas Foster Crepes (which still rock with the usual ice cream).
Went here for the first time and was very happy with my experience. Servers were great and helpful with the menu and drinks. Quick and friendly service and the food was delicious. The atmosphere was great and we had great seating outside looking at the Bellagio fountains from our table. The pricing was reasonable and wasn't too expensive as other restaurants are in Vegas. Good food, good service, nice strip view outdoor seating. Can't complain.
Make reservations on Opentable.com and you'll be happier.  If you're patient, ask to sit outside, or near the patio.  . . The lighting on the inside is insanely dark, and if you're placed in the corner, you have to use your cell phone light to read the menu.  Some may call it romantic, but I call it a pain in the butt.. . For their signature steaks, they use their own "cut" of meat.  Whatever cut it is, its pretty tasty and I don't know if its tender because they beat the crap out of it, or tenderize it with seasoning.  I don't ask... I just eat it, hoping its not old meat, that's creatively cooked.. . Its not the most expensive steak house, but its also not coffee shop cheap.  Dinner for 2 will set you back $70, and unfortunately they don't let you pay with your Total Rewards points.
Great restaurant. Good food, awesome atmosphere. You should wait for a outside table, the view of the strip is fabulous. We have been to Vegas twice and to "Mon ami Gabi" as many times.. . The Filet Mignon will melt in you mouth.. . The only down side, if you are sitting outside it can be loud, but well worth it.
***Mon Ami Gabi is a very popular French brasserie though I found their brunch to be mediocre and disappointing; the restaurant has a great atmosphere and nice service though***. . Mon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas' Paris has been around for a long time and it still seems to be as popular as ever.  If you have been to Las Vegas, you have likely walked past this French brasserie; it is the one with the big outdoor patio just outside the Paris hotel that looks like either a great spot or a very hot place to have brunch or lunch.  Mon Ami Gabi is from famous Chicago chef Jean Joho, who also runs Paris' fine dining restaurant The Eiffel Tower Restaurant and Chicago's Everest.. . While I was not a fan of The Eiffel Tower Restaurant, I was looking forward to trying Mon Ami Gabi.  This French brasserie seemed like a good choice for a delicious but not too expensive brunch.  I really liked the look.  The outdoor patio can be nice during some parts of the year and the restaurant also has an indoor-outdoor dining area, which offers a good view and a lot of sunlight but still provides a French bistro-esque room with good tables and a comfortable temperature.. . Mon Ami Gabi's brunch menu features a mix of breakfast and lunch dishes from Eggs Benedict and omelets to steak frites and sandwiches like the Croque Madame, which I ordered.  Unfortunately, it was not good.  The ham was too thickly cut and quite dry while the toasted bread was dry, hard and way too crunchy.  The cheese did not have that stretchy and melted quality that a good Croque Madame has.. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=RSpAHvSIkAL21g6FHhd-Mw#8hc0hKwEWBkyr-oSH8V1dA. . The Croque Madame was topped, of course, with a fried egg.  Unfortunately, the fried egg was quite burnt around the edges.  The fries had a thin potato chip-like cut.  They were not super crispy, but I liked the soft insides contrasted against the crispy edges.  Unfortunately, the fries were quite salty.. . For dessert, I had their profiteroles and this was a much better representation of a classic French dish.  The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.  The chocolate topping was not the traditional thin dark chocolate sauce.  Instead, it was a thick double fudge sauce. While I prefer the more traditional thin bittersweet chocolate sauce, the chocolate combined with the ice cream and pastry to make a satisfying dessert.. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=RSpAHvSIkAL21g6FHhd-Mw#3Vy7BG3KJjbNjcREFoUeJQ. . Service was good.  My server was very pleasant, polite and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.. . Prices were not too bad for their breakfast and brunch options.  Some of their steak dishes seemed pricey, but they were similar to other Las Vegas restaurants though Las Vegas restaurants tend to be very overpriced.. . Bouchon is Las Vegas' signature French brasserie, but I try to seek out other places.  Bouchon is perfectly fine, but it feels very similar to the Bouchons in Yountville and Beverly Hills (in terms of food, the Yountville location is easily the best of the bunch).  Mon Ami Gabi offers a more unique experience for people on the West Coast (Mon Ami Gabi has several locations in the middle of the country and the East Coast).. . Unfortunately, the food at Mon Ami Gabi was simply not that good.  While I liked Mon Ami Gabi's service and atmosphere, Bouchon is a much better option if you desire a French brunch (or dinner); it would probably not cost you that much more either.  Comme Ca in The Cosmopolitan would probably also be a better option for French bistro fare than Mon Ami Gabi.. . Like most Las Vegas hotels and casinos, Paris offers complimentary valet and self parking.
I made a reservation for one via Open Table and I'm really glad I did because it was very busy for lunch (12:30PM). I wasn't able to opt for the extra 15-minute wait for patio seating (it became a 30-minute wait by 12:45), but I think it's worthwhile.. . Getting to my table was quite the ordeal. I was told that my table was being prepared when I checked in, however, I was still waiting after several other groups, most arriving after I did, was seated before me. I finally approached them after almost ten minutes and this was followed by a few more minutes of "here's your table, nope, it's not available, waiting awkwardly, walking around the dining area, here's another table in the dark, there's other tables available, but not for one person, etc." It's a long story and I've spared the details. I was finally seated at a table next to the window overlooking the patio and it was very pretty. . . Because of the lengthy windows and almost dome-like ceiling of this area, it's a wonderful alternative to their coveted patio dining. You still have a really great view and the light is magnificent (probably not so much in the summer). Although, if you sit right along the glass, like I did, you are awkwardly close to patrons on the other side. Besides the odd setting, I think this indoor "glass room" is better than actually sitting outside. You still get all the benefits of the restaurant's location without the car and foot traffic, outdoor elements, and people gawking at you.. . You start your meal with fresh, warm baguette and creamy butter. I love that the loaf arrives in a "Mon Ami Gabi" bag, where you just tear off pieces to eat and it allows for easy travel. The bread had a great crust and soft, chewy center. Delicious.. . I had the Wild Escargots de Bourgogne ($14.95), oven-roasted snails in garlic herb butter, and Seafood Crepe ($15.95) made with scallops, shrimp, peas, and cream, served with a frisee and vinaigrette salad. The escargot was delicious! Especially that butter. Since it's served in the specially-made cast iron pan that it was baked, the dish is still warm until you're done. The "sauce" is extremely fragrant and went perfectly with the baguette. The crepe was wonderful, filled with light cream and peas, topped with scrumptious scallops (it comes with two pieces, however, they're most likely one big scallop sliced in half) and plump shrimp (three nicely-sized crustaceans). The light and refreshing salad was a great companion as well.. . Service was very pleasant and quick to respond to my needs and necessity to finish my meal in the allotted time. The beginning was a bit shaky and it did cause my having to rush through lunch, however, I was very pleased with the table and the view made me smile. It also helped that the weather was gorgeous! I would love to dine here again, preferably for breakfast and/or brunch and dinner. I believe I've only visited once previously, approximately 7-8 years ago, for dinner, but I don't remember much!
Good food decent price! But for some reason French fries isn't that good while the French onion soup is at room temperature and wasn't hot enough.. . Go for the steak, it's very tender n juicy but the season isn't as impressive. For the price that you are expecting to pay, this supposedly is affordable French food!
We have been here several times.  Being that I am gluten free, we jump at the chance to try a restaurant that has a GF menu.  . . With a great view of the Las Vegas Strip, you have a great atmosphere.  . . I was pleasantly surprised to see they brought me GF bread to munch on before my meal arrived.  I love the Vegetable Farcis (GF menu) and my husband loves the Salmon entree (also on the GF menu, but he is not GF).  . . For a taste of a little french flair, be sure to try this eatery.
Love going here because it has nice outdoor seating to people watch on the Strip. Tried their seafood platter and it was fantastic. Could have done with a little more crab and lobster than those squishy clams, but we really enjoyed ourselves.
I stop in at Mon Ami Gabi every single time I'm in Vegas. There is something about the delicious goat cheese appetizer that keeps bringing me back. Everything from their cuts of meat to burgers to chicken dishes are just mouth watering! And who could forget that view? The service is always friendly and they are quick to communicate... the first time I ate here someone dropped my entree and the manager came out to tell me... Being courteous goes a long way.
The sun is getting too intense. Make sure you ask for a seat in the shade or at least an umbrella. Try the Frangria!
They have a great selection for Gluten Free options that don't make you weird about eating gluten free!!! . . Usually I have to stare at the bread basket as others dig in, but they even brought me my very own GFree bread, I was so excited! This is what put them over the top for me.. . The food is fresh and delicious and I usually take tourists there at least once. You can't beat the view.
Great place for a late night meal. Cool atomosphere, plus since its George Wallace's fav, there . are some good star sightings to be had here.
I was not happy with my meal.... most of my friends weren't either... although gravy was good . Too expensive , expected better , but I love Paris HOTEL :)
I had checked previous Yelpers stating how wonderful the food was here. And they were most definitely right.. . The service was top notch, we got seated almost right away even though the place was packed. Great portions for being French cuisine. The ah loved streak was divine. The peppercorn sauce complemented the steak. The fries were amazing due to the extra crisp texture. Best breakfast I had hands down.. . Will recommend and will come back soon.
Loved this place! . Food, service,ambiance etc... A Vegas must!
Great place! Have been there once. Their bread and french onion soup was amazing! they also had great seafood.
The BEST WAFFLES in the WORLD!  We always look forward to our breakfast at mon ami gabi and can't wait to have their waffles.  We go out to brunches often and tried a lot of waffles, but these are truly amazing: crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside.  We discovered this place for breakfast 5 years ago and now have been coming back every time we're in Vegas.  Try the waffles!  Their benedicts are also great: eggs poached to perfection.
I was here for a client lunch and after some confusion when we checked in, we had a good experience.  I had the Classique steak frites and it was really good.  I wished we had been able to sit outside since it was gorgeous but it was packed.
This is the third time that I came, so I'm giving a combined review of the restaurant. . . I tried the warm Brie appetizer, good but not great. The steak is good, but had better elsewhere. Scallop appetizer was something memorable for me. Dessert was nothing memorable. The views are good if u sit at patio. The view itself is worth 5 stars!
My friends and I came here after the Rock n Roll marathon, and we were surprised the place still opened late! I am usually not a beef type of girl unless it's shabu or hot pot or something. I'm boring when it comes to steak houses...just give me a filet mignon, and I'll be happy. Like, how can you go wrong with one of the most tender cut of beef, right? But at Mon Ami Gabi, how can you go SO right with it that all other ones you had became eh??  The piece of filet mignon was small (as usual like most other steak houses), but the char on this one was superb. Not to mention the merlot glaze totally compliments it! The frites that come with it filled over 2/3 of the plate, but they shaped a bit flat, but super delicoius and crisp! Dip them in the merlot sauce, and they're still good. The french green beans, as a side, was so buttery! . . The service was just okay though. The waitress came back occasionally but not noted to details like few of us need our water refill and so forth.
One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! The steaks are great, but the mussels are amazing. . . The service is wonderful. They kindly split the bill into 12 separate checks for our large group.
As expected was very busy as most places in Vegas are. Came with a party of 7 and had a reservation; wait staff handled it well.. . Good location on the strip; I would sit outside or on the patio if possible.. . I tried the onion soup, steak bordelaise and the salmon.. . First thing I noticed was water stains on the steak knife, after conferring with my party turns out one side of the knife always has water marks.. . The onion soup itself was a bit runny with a heavy hand on the cheese; the bread in the soup seemed to be in there for days. The steak bordelaise was a bit bland and the cut a bit thin for my taste; the steak merlot on the other hand seemed overly sweet. The fries that came with the steak were oddly not bad. The salmon was pretty bland as well; nothing too special, not terrible either; typical flavoring of pepper salt and lemon.. . For the price it's a nice ambience in Vegas, but in terms of the food, there are many other options available.
The reviews pretty much say it all. The food here was very very good. I ordered the chicken and mushroom crepe. It was hard to make a decision on the menu because all the food sounded so delicious. The crepe was the best I've ever had. The presentation on the plate was amazing and the flavor didn't disappoint. The service here was very good and the servers knew who ordered what without asking. The restaurant is very busy so expect to wait at least 30 minutes for a table. I would have given this place five stars but they had accidentally seated another party at our table which caused quite a bit of confusion and frustration. The food and service after that made up for it and my group had all forgotten the drama after enjoying the delicious food and wonderful ambiance.
Remember to make a reservation before coming here and try to request outdoors/patio seating. The table for our party of 7 was ready for us as soon as everyone arrived.. . The servers were very attentive and our waiter had a great sense of humor. I ordered the merlot steak frites. The red wine sauce was on the sweeter end and the steak wasn't very tender and juicy (despite it being medium rare). However the frites were pretty crispy and went well with the red wine sauce. Most of my friends ordered the steak frites so I didn't get to try a wide variety of items on the menu, which could very well have been more impressive.
Une brasserie vraiment francais, on the Las Vegas Strip? Mais, bien sur! Having been to France many times, Mon Ami Gabi reminded me so much of a real Parisian brasserie (casual restaurant and drinking establishment).  Especially the open-air tables on the patio facing the Strip, if you are lucky enough to get a table there. Unfortunately, even with reservations (very much needed) you are not guaranteed a table on the patio during meal times. . Other than our obstructed view of the Bellagio fountains, though, this was a pretty nice experience. It had all the bustle of a real brasserie, and briskly efficient (and even a bit snooty) service from an older French waiter. The special entree of the night, 2 gorgeous lamb chops, was really a standout. Steak au poivre was also very good. I was surprised the duck leg that I ordered was listed as an "appetizer"! It was the biggest, most delicious chunk-o-duck I've ever eaten (a bargain at $12.95)! I added the whipped cauliflower as a side, and not only had to share that around the table; but ultimately had to learn to make it at home b/c my husband liked it so much! . For dessert, the creme brulee was excellent--in this city, they better be on their A-game with a dessert that every restaurant here offers! (I'm making it my personal mission to try every creme brulee in this town :-) The only thing that was a little weird were the pommes frites: they weren't the hot, salty, shoestring French fries I had in the classic "steak frites" in France; but more like those dry potato sticks one gets in canisters. Some of us liked them, some did not.. Not as expensive as we feared it might be (then again, only one of us had an alcoholic drink).This is NOT the experimental, uber-upscale French; this is casual French, with a lot of "brasserie" standards. . Again, get reservations! Then decide whether you want to eat inside and have a conversation, or sit outside and absorb the overwhelming experience that is the strip in the evening; because you won't be able to do both.
Things come and go in Vegas, but this one is consistently good.  Lovely ambiance.  Really great food.
The food was great and making the reservation was easy! My only complaint was that the tiled floors were so slippery especially when walking in heels!
The best coffee! Even my husband agreed and he's not easily impressed by anything. I would have breakfast here everyday if I could. The bananas foster waffles were do die for. I don't like things too sweet so I didn't add any syrup as the foster sauce was sweet enough. Light fluffy waffles with a nice crisp to it. . . Husband got the pancakes, which aren't pancakes in the American sense of pancakes. But he thought it was ok too. . . We sat inside right by the windows which look out to the al fresco dining and across from the Bellagio fountains. . . It does bring me back to that time we spent frequenting those lovely Parisian bistros. Loved it.. . . I would also like to add for any parents traveling with small children. They are very kid friendly, offering a kids menu and crayons and paper for them too. It means so much not to have to sacrifice quality and experience in order to accommodate our little ones. They were so sweet to us.
For someone that says they are food allergy friendly they seem to be doing a terrible job. I have a really severe egg allergy and a gluten intolerance. After waiting 30+ minutes for our food it arrived, with bread, and mayonnaise. Seriously?? 2 out of the 3 dishes were just totally wrong. . . Our server apologized and told us in all of the time he had been there he had never had that problem. I accepted and prepared to wait again. . . When they brought out our food finally, it was wrong again. My chicken with apples and brie? No brie. Also a giant silver server of mayonnaise, again. . . At this point I was about to have a full on panic attack. I got about two bites in and realized that my food was cold. Since it was wrong initially I assume it sat in the window while everyones elses was remade. There was no way I was going to be able to comfortably eat this, since they clearly did not take food allergies seriously. . . They did apologize profusely and took a big chunk of the bill off, but it was the worst restaurant we went to for the 5 days we were in Vegas, we will never be back. . . I wouldn't leave such a harsh review if they hadn't told us from my initial phone call before our trip, and when we sat down at the table, that they took food allergies seriously and were more than capable of handling it. . . They need to go back over the system they have in place because it is not working.
the food and atmosphere was spectacular!  it was one of the highlights of our trip.  make a reservation thru yelp for inside seating and let them know that you want outdoor seating and they will accommodate with next avail patio table.  loved the lobster roll!
Classy yet affordable, Mon Ami Gabi located in the Paris Hotel is an absolute gem.  . . Ordered the Steak Frites, and I wasn't disappointed.
Love love! . . My brother and I went on a sunny day in Vegas. It's beautiful! Great people watching, and lovely to sit outdoors (I came from freezing NY and he came from Montreal, so the weather was definitely a plus). . . The food was great, I had a chicken salad, and my brother had the burger. They serve a loaf of bread in the beginning which they don't slice. Found that a little odd.. . Otherwise the service was quick and polite, and our server doled out tons of recommendations. A must do especially for lunch!
We made dinner reservations for the main dining room (since they don't take reservations for the patio). But when we got there, the kind hostess offered us a prime spot in the patio! We had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains throughout the evening and I couldn't have asked for a more romantic setting.. . The service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and entertaining. He was easy to track down and seemed to always show up when we needed something. . . I had the classique steak frites and my fiance had the burger (lol). I couldn't stop munching on the frites - they were so good!. . Overall, a great experience. Perfect spot for date night or people-watching with friends. Can't wait to come back!
Great brunch spot! Definitely make a reservation. Highly recommended.
Food: 3 stars, Service: 4 stars, Location/atmosphere: 5 stars. . This place is where you wanna come for a nice drink and people watching on the patio. Food is way overpriced and nothing special.
food was ok. nothing special. just over-priced vegas food. nice if you get a seat on the patio. we were shoved in a corner in the main dining room.
I read great things about this restaurant, so I had to try it. I made a reservation on Opentable and was seated upon arrival. The day that I went was raining so seating on the patio was not available. I went during lunch time, so the restaurant wasn't too full.. . Overall, I had a pleasant time. My waitress was really nice and took care of me since I was eating by myself. I loved the warm french bread. It was too much for me to eat in one sitting, so I took the leftovers back home. . . I ordered the trout with green beans and almonds. The trout was great and was cooked well. It was a bit strange that the waitress asked if it was okay that the fish has skin. Maybe people don't eat fish with skin on? . . As for dessert, I had the white chocolate butterscotch bread pudding. It was a recommendation from the waitress, and it was very good. The bread pudding wasn't overly sweet, especially with the butterscotch at the bottom of the bread pudding. I enjoyed it. . . Take a walk after your meal since you will be stuffed!
I had their trout dinner and it was fantastic! Their Frangria (their version of Sangria) is made with rosemary and wasn't to my liking (tasted like pine tree). Their sea scallops were great too! I think it is a little bit on the expensive side for the amount of food that you get, but then again it is in a major casino on the strip. Mon Ami Gabi is a great place, but it doesn't top my go-to restaurant, Maggiano's, which is just down the strip at the Fashion Show Mall.
I love this place i've had just about everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.. . MAKE A RESERVATION!! you will need it. . . service is amazing - management is always happy to be of service should anything be a little off.. . but seriously it really is some of the best french influenced food in town. I wish i made it out there more often. but its just kinda crazy to get out there.. . anyway. go and be merry this place will not disappoint!
This is absolutely one of my favorite brunch spots. The ambiance is unquestionably the best part, with a view of the Bellagio fountains and covered patio seating. I love the Escargot and baked Brie to start and usually go into the frisee and bacon salad from there. Ask for Rian to be your server, he's awesome!
I have been here on several occasions over the years and it is consistently good, with consistently good service. I love sitting on the patio for weekend brunch! But get there early because everyone else likes that too! You cannot beat it on the strip for eating right on the historic Las Vegas Boulevard.
My favorite place to visit on the Las Vegas strip. Perfect to people watch and enjoy the views.
Wonderful place to grab lunch! It had a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere and the food was amazing. I got the duck confit which was an appetizer although it was still pretty large. They also have delicious bread in the beginning!
Such a nice place to sit outside for lunch. The waiters provide such good service and are there to please you! I had the filet mignon merlot and it was super tender! I tried escargot for the first time here and I loved it! The bread and butter they come out with is soo fresh! Definitely a place ill return to
Arrived for dinner  with a party of 16. The waitress was awesome!!! She arrived to the table within a few minutes after we got sat.  I ordered the Filet Mignon Au Poivre, and the Beet & Goat Cheese Salad. The salad needed a little bit more goat cheese & beets and a little less arugula. Filet mignon was good. Bananas Foster was delicious.  Ambiance was nice. . The best thing about this place was the service from our waitress/ food runners. All appetizers, salads/soups, entrees delivered in a timely manner. Water glasses (and wine) never reached the half way empty point. . 5 stars for the exceptional service which is a biggie for me :)
Norma is our server and she does an absolutely incredible job. . Tonight we had the Dover sole fillet mignon and the steak Bearnaise. . . The steak Bearnaise was fantastic!  Though the steak itself is a thin cut, it melts in your mouth.  Also, for being a French venue, the portion sizes were very generous.
FRAUD ALERT:  The food was fine, however as we received our check our waiter "upsold" us on joining a membership club for diners. Apparently we would receive in the mail a package of coupons and certificates well in excess of the price of the fee to join.  Three months and several aggravating long phone calls later we never received a card in the mail and there are no coupons or benefits as promised.
I love this place!!!! It helped that we had arguably the best table for a view of the Bellagio fountains as well as a supposedly French waiter. The setting is absolutely perfect for both people watching and a great view of the city.  We had the bacon and frisee salad upon our waiter's recommendation, and it was delicious. We also had shrimp cocktail and steak frites with merlot butter sauce as well as peppercorn sauce on the side. We decided we liked the peppercorn slightly better, but both were delicious. Our waiter was also a real character and kept us entertained, even bringing us a free dessert at the end.
Great atmosphere outside, right across from the Bellagio fountains and great for people watching. . My drink of choice was the Frangria! The french twist on Sangria! It wasn't too sweet and not much fruit in the drink itself, except for some orange slices, but it was good. I ordered a second round. . Food was ordered. Appetizers included Escargot - it came in a DELICIOUS garlicy sauce perfect for dipping the bread in. Could probably make this a meal with the bread and AMAZING sauce! I tried one of the snails too and it really doesn't taste like anything. But DAAAAAMN, that sauce!!! NOM NOM NOM! . I had a Caesar salad and it was nothing to rant and rave about. When it hit the table I was actually rather disappointed with the presentation and how PLAIN it looked. The French Onion soup wasn't too bad, the usual saltiness and nice and cheesy.. For my entree I of course had to order the Scallops! I was actually NOT impressed with the scallops at all. I ate two of them and had the rest boxed up. Normally no matter how full I am, I would DEVOUR my scallops. They were just so-so. Not as tender, buttery, awesomely-delicious as ones I've had in the past. . Friend ordered the special, Bacon wrapped filet medallions with fingerling potatoes. I like bacon, but I really don't care for bacon wrapped foods. I tried a piece with the bacon on it and wasn't really impressed. Then I tried a piece without the bacon and it tasted a lot better to me. . For dessert we ordered the Chocolate Mousse which was OKAY. It came with these little chocolate crunchy balls on top that I didn't care for too much, but the Mousse itself wasn't bad. . There was also White Chocolate Bread Pudding which was GOOD! I've had bread pudding before and never really liked it but this one was actually DELISH. . I believe my dessert was THE best one out of the three: the Banana's Foster Crepe! So SO good with the caramel, sliced bananas and vanilla ice cream! It was fresh tasting and awesome! NOM NOM!
Must try this place for brunch yo!!! Must try: Blueberry French Toast, Banana Foster Waffle, Apple Crepe and the bloody mary bar yo!!
Tourist trap with a gluten-free menu - that's how we got reeled in... not worth it.. . We started with bread/onion soup (regular for me, GF for my husband) - not bad, served piping hot.. . I had the scallops - served barely warm on a severely hot dish... the scallops were way over-salted and gritty.  My husband had one of the steaks (maybe the hanger..?) which he said was cooked to order and tasty.. . The service felt really forced and faux-French... felt like they were trying way too hard to give the "experience" of being in Paris without delivering the quality.  I know, it's Vegas...
An affordable place that makes you feel special. As a student, Vegas trip usually means cramming as many people into the room as possible, getting drank, fist pumping to the music, and the morning/noon pho as hang over cure. A fancy dinner and show is not in the picture. . . Most of the places are owned by famous chefs that comes with a hefty price tag that we can't afford. wahhh :(. . My friend told me about Mon Ami Gabi, and this change my Vegas trip completely. It definitely up my vegas trip class level by a lot without having to spend extra $$$$$. . . Most of the items on the menu are under $20 and closer to $15, except the steaks.  Thus without having to spend a fortune, you can sit in the patio by the strip and watch the Bellagio water show! . . I ordered the Smoked Salmon & Egg Salad Tartine which was fantastic. I would not make any modification to it. I love the way it is. . . The friend who recommend this place told me that the escargots were really good. I didn't get to try because I am still on a budget.... . My roommate and I shared flour-less chocolate cake. My roommate really enjoyed the cake. We cleaned the plate! The cake was topped with some sort of sour cream, which we didn't really care much and wished it was ice cream. . . To start the meal, they give each table  a loaf of french baguette and butter. If you can't have gluten, you can still have some bread just ask! They even have a gluten-free menu.. . They do take reservation; however, patio seating is first come first serve basis. The interior design gives a pretty old school classy vibe, so even if you can't get a table outside, it would still be a great experience.
Really awesome food and experience.  Had coffee and eggs Benedict for brunch. Coffee was excellent and unlimited refills.  Eggs Benedict were solid, but nothing too exceptional.  Had bites of Cobb salad, which was really good, and the steak and frites are a big winner.  Extensive Bloody Mary bar if you're into it.  Wait staff was friendly and efficient. It's right in the strip, but the food was reasonably priced for the location and quality of the meal.  Will go back and recommend for sure
I hope I just came here on an off night, or over 3000 Yelp reviewers have messed-up taste buds.. . I trotted over here for dinner and had a reservation, so I was seated promptly near the big window with a very pretty view of the Bellagio fountains and the Cosmopolitan. The place was pretty busy and loud, which I liked!. . Okay. The food here was so underwhelming.. and just plain bad. I am sorry to say. I guess this is better for brunch/lunch and not dinner?. . Service: Maria was nice and attentive.. . The bread: Cold, chewy, a bad sign.. . The wine: We got the Pinot Noir. Which was a bad decision for me because I just don't like alcoholic drinks. My mom was okay with it. It was alcohol-y. UndertOHnes of alcohol and OHvertones of ick. But I am just immature.. . The appetizer:. . Escargot: Very meh and unspecial. Where was the flavor?? I felt like I was eating tenderized, flavor-less snails in a soup of sat fats.. which is what that was.. . The entrees:. . Seared scallops: Whaaaat?? The heck?? The scallops were sandy to the bite and had this disgusting bitter aftertaste. So disappointing. We had to slice off the tops and bottoms to try to avoid the bitter flavor. The sweet pumpkin cream and mushrooms under the scallops were tasty, though.. . Steak au Poivre: Long, thin steak served next to a bunch of cut fries. I liked it, but it wasn't anything special! I could have made this meal, maybe even a tastier version of it, with some steaks and potatoes from Costco!. . Too bad. I was hyped up for this place for reasons that have everything to do with Yelp, but this isn't the first time I have been disappointed by fake French food.. . Also, I got really sick after eating here and took some CVS antacids. It was not a nice night afterwards. I think this place has a great location and view and potential, but the dinner choices disappointed me! It was so below basic.. . I recommend looking elsewhere for a dining experience with focus on good food, because this isn't it. Eat somewhere else, even if it takes an extra cab ride.
Still consistently really good. Food is the star and ambience is great
Came with a party of 5 and sat on the patio watching the fountains at belaggio. Ordered steak chicken and scallops. Scallops were mediocre the steak looked like they had pounded it and it just wasn't very good. After dinner at echo and rig the night before this was a little bit of a let down. . . Service was the only saving factor from getting only two stars. Our server was great and very attentive without being annoying.
I cant sum up how much I like this place...oh wait, yes I can! Amazing, so amazing I ate here 4 times on a 4 day trip! Any breakfast item, any dinner, any wine. You cant go wrong! Please stop in, you wont regret it! French food at its finesr
My husband and I went here for lunch and was immediately impressed with the decor. While we didn't get a seat outside, we found the inside table and ambience to be charming. We had some great champagne cocktails and a French  sangria cocktail, both excellent. The olive tapenade and the honey brie appetizers were yummy and my crepe was outstanding. We shared the chocolate bar dessert and that was great as well. Service is competent and friendly. We will definitely be back!
This has always been one of my favorite steak restaurants. Great food, good ambiance, great wine and amazing steaks and fries, and if you were seated on the patio (right on the LVB strip) you are bound to have an amazing time watching people walk by and catch a glimpse of the Bellagio dancing fountains. My parents were in Vegas recently celebrating my mom's bday, and I knew they had dinner reservations at Mon Ami Gabi, so i called MAG and asked if i would be able to buy them a bottle of wine (i live in LA). The lady that helped me, was Nancy M and i believe she was the restaurant manager. Nancy was great, she helped in handling everything for me. She set everything up very nicely, they were moved to the patio after they were initially seated inside, they presented them with the wine and explained that this was from me, they were also given a complimentary bday cake after dinner. Thank you MAG and thank you Nancy for all your help.
I really liked this place. They are quite affordable for lunch and have great sandwiches. I had the lobster roll which was really authentic like Boston. I also tried the steak sandwich which was excellent. The meat was so juicy and flavorful and went very well with the creamy horseradish and au jus. I highly recommend this place
