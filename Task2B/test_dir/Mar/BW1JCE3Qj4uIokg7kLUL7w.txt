Filthy dirty.... does Mr. Puck ever look at the places that use his name?  All I wanted was a simple bowl of chicken soup (and the description on the menu sounded perfect).  It was a salty water "soup" with uncooked onions (lots of them) there were no parsnips in the soup at all (which was listed as an ingredient on the menu).  . . I wasn't served by my waitress, and when she finally did come to check on me, I asked if the soup ($13 bowl of soup) comes with bread or crackers... she said, "we don't usually offer bread to our lunch customers, but I guess I could give you some if you want".. . Also, I was seated next to some wood bark object, that they have separating the restaurant from the casino, and when I got a good look at it, it was dusty and filthy. So gross... had I noticed prior to ordering my soup I would have never eaten there. . . Really?
Nom. From their wood fired pizzas, to their salads, to their appetizers, to their drinks, this place was a consistent delight for my drunk friends and myself. We probably spent at least $200 over a course of 3 days. They are opened pretty late (4 am?) and you can sit at the bar to order take out to stuff your face in the privacy of your hotel room. . . Prices are expensive, but not the level of a fancy restaurant so definitely doable for Vegas.
Best pizza I've ever had in Vegas not so sure about the service quality tho! Will def go back anyways! Yum! ;)
Needed somewhere to eat that was open and still serving a full menu at 3am.  Ordered the Truffled Potato Chips, the Wood Oven Roasted Mushroom and Spicy Sopressata Pizzas and finally for dessert, the Chocolate Souffle. . . The chips were delicious.  Very flavorful and fatty.  A perfect late night snack.  The pizzas were large.  I wish we had known how big the pizzas were before we ordered them.  Because one can easily feed 2 people.  The pizzas tasted alright, nothing special really.  But really how often do you get bad pizza?  The souffle was super light.  And even though the pizzas were not finished off, the souffle sure was.  . . It was nice that there was a restaurant open that late that served up a wide variety of food.  Also the atmosphere, while being out in the middle of the casino, was modern and semi private.  Prices were a tad high, which is why I had to drop the rating down to 3 stars.
We came here before KA and yes kinda pricey however your at Wolfgang Puck. I had fettuccine and it was the best I have ever had. For an appetizer we had cheese fries with wild boar meat and a fried egg (recommended app of the day). Chocolate Souffle for dessert and that was my favorite thing and I am not a huge chocolate fan. The service was so-so.
Awesome place to get some nice food before going on somewhere else. Everything on the menu is the kind of food you can eat and then go on to do more drinking. The pizzas are awesome - great crust, fresh flavors, and a good size. The salads are good too, except the chopped vegetable salad which had flavors (primarily the overwhelming pickled something gross) that did not work for me at all. The menu description made it sounds like a cheese/cream salad, and instead it was very dry with a strange combination of vegetables - asparagus, pickled onions, pickled something green that was so salty it hurt. I don't recall tasting feta or creamy garlic at all. The other salads at my table (green, chinese chicken) looked amazing though. Can't go wrong with the pizza margerita. The cocktails are very good here too, with fresh fruit ingredients and a strong pour. I really liked the banana cheesecake.
We had blue cheese chips , calamari, white pizza, and crab cakes and beer. All were really good and we got full for  under $100..    The server was friendly ..   It was quick ... The crab cakes had crab in them.
This place was pretty goodand our server was a cutie. I came here a few weeks ago when we came to Vegas. I think it's a little on the pricey side, but everyone enjoyed their meal. Oh well, one downside: I don't know what I bit into, but it was as hard as a rock. I was worried I chipped a tooth, but everything with my tooth is okay. I like the setup, it's kind of trendy, but casual. You can watch your chefs prepare your pizza right in front of you.
Ate here with coworkers last night. Nice variety, and good pricing for the area. Excellent wine selections that paired well with the menu. Between the 5 of us, we had 4 different entrees; each outstanding. The gentleman that had the lasagna didn't finish his beer out of fear of washing away the great flavors. I had a veal mushroom pasta, chef special, and found the flavors well balanced and blended.  Will be back again soon!
While a bit on the expensive side for two girls in college, it was well worth the cost. We split the steak skewers and the grilled spinach both of which were divine. Adding to the excellence of the evening was our wonderful waiter, Eddie Bringas. Always prompt, helpful, and had good suggestions for good pairings. Will eat here again!
I went to Vegas thinking In-N-Out would be my burger highlight...that was until I came here. . . I was swinging through the MGM and popped in here for a quick lunch at the bar. I kept it simple and ordered a burger...little did I know it'd be one of the best burgers I've ever had - easily in the top 5. . . I can't speak on anything other than the burger and fries, but those items alone warrant a 5 star rating. Good Work, Wolfgang.
We had a very enjoyable anniversary dinner and dessert here before going to the Cirque show. The food was excellent. Our waiter was attentive and his assistant, Israel was exceptional. The sea bass special was cooked perfectly and very tasty. They even brought us a special anniversary brulle!. The only complaint is that the chairs were uncomfortable. . This place is worth the visit!
Service is excellent. Food is good to excellent though. The blue cheese potato chip is fabulous though my grilled salmon in not above my expectation. Price is reasonable.
Great place to stop in between gambling as the restaurant is located in MGM. The food was surprisingly really good as I understand that this is a chain restaurant. . . It has a nice ambient feel to this place and the wait staff was attentive and helpful.   . . I ordered steak skewers as appetizer. The beef was tender and juicy. . . For dessert, I ordered the chocolate souffle because I saw a yelper post the dessert picture. My sugar addiction immediately  kicked in and said I've got to have one of these. The souffle also came with a side order of ice cream. It definitely complimented the overall dessert taste. . . Great place to dine in as well!
