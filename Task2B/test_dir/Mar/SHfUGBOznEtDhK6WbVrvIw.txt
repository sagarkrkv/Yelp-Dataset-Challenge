sandwiches are OK,  just OK. mass delusional hype is the only explanation. sides were not worth it at all. skip waiting in line like a tool and just order the sandwich to go if you want the "experience", what experience that is I have yet to figure out
classic, if you like smoke meat, this is the place to go!
Is it the greasy floors or the overwhelming smell or the incredible foods? It is hard to tell what makes this place such a "must-visit" destination in Montreal. Come for the smoked meats and stay for the eccentric clientele on Sunday mornings :) It is a one trick pony but a very good one at that.
Lots of hype and expectation but it lived up!. Great smoked meat and the meat seems to melt in your mouth.. We got a plate of the smoked meat which is served with just slices of bread, and then its a DIY sandwich with bread, meat, mustard.. . Mmm... ive been going around the city but i wanna come back here one more time before i leave!
If I could give this place 10 stars I would.  . . The ambiance is unique.  The food is classic. I hope this place never changes.  . . Totally worth this 5 hour drive to Montreal for schwartz.  . . Please expand to toronto!
Smoked meat is an interesting thing. It's corned beef that is smoked with a montreal steak rub. The food is good if you just want a meat sandwich with not a lot of fan-fair. They're known for making this smoked meat, and while it is good, it isn't something truly unforgettable. They give you a choice of lean, medium, and fatty brisket; which I like. I usually get the fatty brisket because I'm thin and in relatively good health. Once you've tried this place, you can branch out and try some of the adaptations to the recipe (smoked meat on mushroom toast, smoked meat on poutin, etc.). Much better than Katz deli in NY. But, then again: what isn't?
This is a Montreal institution, and an essential part of the Montreal experience. Do come here, sit at the counter and order a smoked meat sandwich (medium of course) with a cherry cola. Look around at the crowded tiny space, and soak in the atmosphere. . . Once you have gone once, and have experienced the great smoked meat, and the overall craziness that is the Schwartz experience, I would suggest sticking to the Main across the street for equally good smoked meat, and booths where you can sit and relax without bumping elbows. Also beer.
I was really disappointed. Came in late one night to try the famous blah blah blah and instead left with my friend insulted and feeling pressured into giving a big tip for (pretty slow) counter service!. . The smoked meat sandwich was bland. Just a big pile of bland and old meat, which had clearly been reheated and was now dry and stringy. The fries were, actually, pretty good. The cherry soda, also pretty good in combination with the other things. But in the end it was not worth it.. . The uncomfortable part started when we sat down and the guy behind the counter asked us where we were from. My friend is from Vietnam, and once the counter guy heard that he started going off on how "I bet you're from south Vietnam" and talking about how he knows the whole story, and basically recounting a poor History Channel summary of the Vietnam War from some documentary he watched. Thanks, but my friend already knows. Then he mentioned something about Asians taking jobs, and wouldn't stop talking about Vietnam until I completely changed the subject.. . While we were waiting for the check I hear one of the guys brag about how he just scammed the guy sitting next to us out of 10 dollars by saying he "didn't have any change" and then he pressured us into giving him a higher tip too. We just wanted to leave at that point.. . Yeah the fries were good but maybe go somewhere else where you can get a sandwich that tastes good as well, without the other sh*t.
I love this place!! Fatty smoked meat, mustard on rye with pickle. Yum. Meat melts in your mouth. Bought it home to PA and it reheated (steam) amazingly well. So delicious as my mouth waters!
