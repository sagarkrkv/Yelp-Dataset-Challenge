If I'm going to go to a casino and I don't want to go to the strip, this is my spot! I only live 5 minutes away, can't beat that. I have ate at every restaurant, drank at every bar and have been here more times then I can count. Never had an issue and no complaints. In my opinion no other off strip casino compares!
This is our go to place every summer for my wife and i to have a vacation. We love that it's off the strip and we can sit and relax att he pool all day and enjoy live music at the bars in the evening. Everything is always so clean and the staff has always been great
Love this casino and glad it's away from the Strip. Summerlin is a beautiful part of Las Vegas andso is Red Rock Casino. They have everything from restaurants to bars to the movie theatre. Parking is pretty easy.
Now that we've moved this has been the go to place for the late night specials. Great happy hour at the steakhouse, movie theater, bowling and soon a concert theater. . . So far an all around good place to go for whatever you're in the mood for. With kids or without?
A favorite local casino- easy to access, plenty of parking, movie theater and bowling alley for those of us who don't gamble. Also lots of dining options, from more high-end, sit-down style to classic food court options including Baja Fresh and Ben & Jerry's. . Casino layout is easy to navigate, staff is friendly and helpful, and the sportsbook is big enough to always find seating- and it is one of the nicer local casino 'books, too.. Sad to hear the rumor that the Pinks closed, but you're still likely to find me here at the theater fairly often.
First, a caveat: This resort has a myriad of amenities and things to do - my opinion is limited to the portions that I actually experienced (a small segment!). My overall conclusion: this is a nice place and works out pretty well (though not perfectly) for a couple traveling with a child. . . The context: we roadtripped with our preschooler to Vegas for a friend's wedding and stayed at Red Rock resort in a King room. The room was quite nice and quiet - I loved the decor and the big soaker tub. View of the parking garage - less impressive. The hotel service was great - front desk was really responsive and helpful - we asked for an extra blanket and it arrived within minutes. :) Parking was easy, too. The pool area was huge, and really nice - especially once we found which ones were warm - and the lounge chairs were comfy. The Feast Buffet was grossly bland for breakfast - although we had BOGO coupons, we didn't return - it wasn't worth waiting in the line. We loved the Yard House for the beer selection, Capriottis for a Bobbie, and the BBQ joint (I recommend the brisket/mushroom sandwich) - and no complaints about the Starbucks for the necessary morning coffee. The casino is a bit mall-like, with a foodcourt and movie theater attached. However, the single deck blackjack table was fun.  . . Having the Kids Quest (drop-off daycare) there was *fantastic* for being able to leave the kiddo while we went out to dinner - although it is a long walk from the hotel all the way through a smoky casino to get there. This service alone almost overrides the smoke. Our son had lots of fun bowling and at the arcade. . . There's room for improvement, though - having a weight-based mini bar right out in the open on a low cabinet in the room is not compatible with traveling with a toddler. I threw a towel over it which activated a charge, but the front desk removed it without complaint at checkout, so not a big deal. Also, we knew the casino would be smoky, but I was surprised to find the lobby and the hotel hallways were smoky too - and there are ashtrays at the elevators. I had hoped the smoke would end at the casino. Next time we visit Vegas we'll probably rent a condo, stay with friends, or go to one of the few nonsmoking hotels to stay away from it. I get that smoke is part of the Vegas "thing", but I wanted to provide this info for other non-smoking families who might be curious about the level of the hotel's smokiness.
This hotel and casino seems to be well rounded for kids and adults.... Arcade, Quest (drop your kids off for 8.00 an hour), bowling alley, movie theatre... Plenty of Restaurants..... . . Also get your players card and receive discounts for the buffet.... . Pools are awesome.. . Great place I will definitely be back
Definitely a casino for locals. Definitely a great place to meet up with friends and have a good time. Definitely a fun place for the kiddos. Definitely my favorite casino around town! The movie theater, bowling alley, restaurants, even the hotel rooms are spacious and very modern. Occasionally you can find great room rates from Groupon. Or check their website for package deals, always the worth the money. Parking used to be sort of a pain but they've opened up more spaces recently...thank you!! All around it's just a cool casino. I love the low-key but upbeat vibe.
Great decor and furnishings. It is really nice here.. . Big problem for me was that I was treated poorly by the employees. The customer service here, really is lacking. I had employees interrupt me while speaking, forget about my food orders during breakfast, I had to ask for a refill of my water too. It was ridiculous. . . Now to be clear, I am a really nice guy, plenty of friends and I am hardly ever rude. . . I personally can not understand why I would be treated this way by multiple employees over 3 days. . . When I asked to why they were interrupting me or being rude, they would scoff and walk away. . . I thought about asking for the manager but when it kept happening, I that maybe, the mangers or even higher up the chain may have been a problem for them.. . . I do not want to return to stay here, ever again.
Room was nice. But thats about it. . . Service everywhere was horrible! From the waitresses to the bowling alley and bartenders to the front desk at checkout. Felt like I was asking them to go out of their way just by asking them to do their job. Couldn't get an hour late checkout on a Monday? . . Yea. Never again.
Great hotel. I got bumped from a standard queen to a suite. Needless to say I had a great visit. My luck carried over to the craps table. The staff was very friendly, and the food was great. The pool has to be one of the best in Vegas.
I really like the design of this casino and resort. It is beautifully appointed and classy. I like that there are both casual eateries/food court for kids before or after catching a movie at Regal Cinemas inside the casino, as well as a fine dining restaurant (T-Bones). The Red Rock Lanes bowling alley within this casino, as well as the movie theater within the casino make this place kid-friendly when we visit. A penthouse suite that my in-laws booked was beautifully appointedwith luxury amenities, furniture, a billiard table, and absolutely breathtaking views...gorgeous.
