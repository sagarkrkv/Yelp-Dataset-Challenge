It's my favorite Cirque du Soleil show. Seen it 3 or 4 times, always greatly impressed.
The best cirque show out of all of them!!  IT'S so beautiful!!! The stunts were amazing. Very entertaining. Highly recommended. We just wish we had gotten seats that were a little closer to the stage. We sat at the very top of the first section closer to the stage route N. Pretty great view. I kept getting chills throughout the show.
Most people will tell you that O is the best Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas. Well, I think that depends on what you are looking for. It is certainly the most romantic. I enjoyed KA very much because it has a more defined story line and I love how whimsical the Love show is. I did not enjoy Mystere but I think that one is more geared towards kids. If you want just pure grace and beauty then O is the one for you. I loved every minute of it.
Quite possibly the best Cirque du Soleil show I have ever watched. So much fun, combines acrobatics with aquatics. All around impressive. We loved every minute.
Another Cirque performance that makes we want to do acrobatics!  This one is amazing plus some because of the water.  My friends and I all agreed the stage/pool was one of the coolest things we had ever seen.  One second it was a dry floor, then people were either flying into or coming out of the water.   They kept your attention elsewhere while the floor morphed into a pool and vice versa.. . After we left, we heard there is a tour you can take of the inner workings.  This would be worth it after you saw the show to better understand that amazing floor!  . . The athleticism is unbelievable, and I would really like to know how they have feet strong enough to hold on to a flying trapeze and another person at the same time. . .  I have never seen a Cirque show I did not like and this one did not disappoint.
oh my goodness gracious. can we ask everyone to describe the word magical? that's what this show brought out. the music & act was so ethereal and emotional with pretty much NO words spoken at any time. something i love about cirque du soleil is that because majority of their shows are acrobatic and visual, it leaves a lot to your imagination to interpret what you see. . . throughout this show enchanting music in sung, amazing tricks are done beyond skillfully & gracefully. the makeup, the hair, the costumes, the attention to detail in everything theater really blows your mind away. . . so besides all the amazing skill that is so worth seeing... let your mind wander... what is the clown thinking? is that guy really on fire? is this a story about love? adventure? fear? magic? a dream? or just a whole other reality all together? you gotta tell the story in your own head & get back to me... i'm still trying to decide if i'm set on the story I've told in my head.. . a must see masterpiece that you won't regret experiencing!
The  best  show I have ever seen from Cirque, Music, set, everything leaves you Breathless.. A memory sure to last a lifetime.. A show not to  miss, if I get the chance will see it again.
I had seen this show the first year it opened (so I barely remembered it anymore) and my new wife had never seen it and this was on the "must do" list for our time in Vegas,. . Anyways, the stage is impressive. The amount of water they use is truly a testament to the lavishness (and to be honest, wastefulness) that is Vegas.. . The acts were all great. I'm always happy to see a bunch of acrobatic dives. Synchronized swimming is all the more impressive because of the sheer number of swimmers who have to synchronize.. . One the ship-trapeze act, the artist fell into the water. They recovered nicely. The artist swam up and "collapsed" on the stage until the act was over. I assume they have a backup plan for every act to make it seem as if things are intentional.. . I did find that there were a few too many lulls in the action and I'm used to seeing a big finale with everyone simultaneously doing their thing at the end but there was none here.. . See the show. If money is a concern, then try something else like Mystere.
besides the fact that i lost all my fucking money at the piece of shit bellagio this show was SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. . i don't understand how anyone can give this less than 4 stars!. . the stage is huge, the acts were great, the songs were exciting, and the clowns were SO CUTE! . . let me tell you.. anything with water and fire is fucking exciting and if you think it's not then you live a sad life and you're lame as fuck.. . GO WATCH O!! it's worth the $22348230948293042.99 or however much you're paying for this show. :)
This was by far the best cirque show I've seen. The whole show transports you to another world. It's a little eerie and some of the acting is predictable but they have really amazing feats! I was holding my breath half the time. . . The stage and all the props were so intricate. It consisted of so many moving parts. At times, people just came underwater seemingly from nowhere. At every scene there was always a ton to look at. Not just the acrobats but side performers as well. Never a dull moment!. . We sat in the fifth row and seriously, these were great seats! Completely worth seeing up close.
This is the best show I have ever seen in my LIFE. It also helps that we got free FRONT ROW tickets from myvegas. The show was amazing, and getting splashed with water did not affect us. We still had a great time. The costume was amazing, the performers were great, and the photographer outside of the theater was amazing as well. All in All A+++++
Breathtaking, mind numbing and unforgettable. One of the best art experiences of my life.
My husband surprised me with tickets to this show for our anniversary. I am the one who usually likes show, musicals, etc. Sometimes I feel like he just watches them for me. He watched this one and was amazed. He loved it! I thought this was the BEST Cirque Du Soleil show I have seen thus far.
