Must go if you are in Vegas, even if you are not staying at Venetian.. . The restaurant is a little hard to find. you have to go up to the 10th floor through the elevator bank as if you are heading to the hotel rooms. . . Both brunch and dinner are worth the trip. Each presents its own vibe and excellent selections on the menu. Brunch is certainly the way to go if you want to taste Thomas Keller's extraodinary work at an affordable price. Reservation is not available for brunch though. So the wait could be a little intimidating. . . If fat does not bother you, definitely order the foie gras, however it's seared, terrine, or in other special forms. Pastry baskets are awesome for sharing during brunch. Oh and my favorite chicken & waffle!
Dined at Bouchon for the first time, with high expectations. Unfortunately, Bouchon was a disappointment.. . We were seated within a couple of minutes of arriving, and were promptly offered water by our waiter. But oddly, he did not ask if we wanted any other beverages until 10 minutes later. Lost opportunity for alcohol sales.. . We started with onion soup, which didn't have much of an onion taste. Very strange. The soup came out promptly, but we waited for about 30 minutes for the mains. For entrees, we had steak frites and the roasted chicken. Both dishes were on the bland side. Had to request salt for the table.. . We skipped desserts. Probably would not return to Bouchon.
Incredible food, incredible service! The Pork Belly Rillette was to die for! Would go back in a heartbeat!
I've tried both brunch and dinner at Bouchon, and I'd rather go for Brunch; its better and less expensive. The brunch is nothing like Thomas Keller's Ad Hoc, but it's not horrible. I usually order the Croque Madame, and it is always really good. The bread is thick so it soaks up all the flavors of the meat, and the runny creamy yolk. Yum! I'm giving Bouchon 3 stars because dinner (been twice) is expensive ($75+) and all the dishes are simply forgettable. All I remember from dinner is the complimentary bread (which is always fresh and hot!) and the Terrine Foie Gras, which was decent. I recently ordered a pork dish, and it was not that great... Lacked flavor. And I was trying other friends dishes and I didn't find one I loved either! :(  I've decided that I would probably only come back here for Brunch...
Very disappointing ! I had a lot of expectation from this place , heard so much about the chef and basically it's really not that good . Beside the food everything was ok so really the star is just for the food . The fish dish was awful ! I even think it wasn't fresh because of the after taste . Seriously the $1000 bill wasn't well spent
Ate here two days in a row. That means it was good. I enjoyed the oysters they have here. I'd recommend getting a dozen for yourself and then chasing it down with 3 or 4 bloody marys.
Had a business meeting at Bouchon.  Great service and excellent food. Would definitely come back for a nice meal with my wife.
My husband and I  had such high expectations!  Our server was nowhere to be found and appeared to have no interest to serve us during our dinner experience.  I asked him for the highlights of the signature dishes which he shared in a  rush --less than 1/2 the tables were occupied!. . I followed his suggestion and ordered the scallop entree which served over an interesting sounding cabbage.  The large sea scallops as well as the bed of cabbage was served cold/scallops were cold to the touch.When I informed the server that I would prefer the food temperature  hotter, he told me the chef would prefer not to over cook the scallops.  I would've expected a restaurant such as this to serve food at the correct temperatures or be willing to provide an alternate entree.. . I found the meal inedible.  We never saw the waiter again during the meal until after the plates were cleared.  I informed the waiter that I did not eat the entree and ordered a cheese plate to go-- as I was still hungry.  Upon delivering the check, he told us he did not charge us for the scallops like he was doing a favor and getting us out of his table!. . Sounds like we should've tried Bouchon for brunch because very unimpressed with dinner!
Really slow service. Mediocre food that is pricey. Love the bakery, but the bistro is not worth the money.. . I had the Croque Monsieur and the omelette du jour. both were just okay.
Came here for brunch with a bunch of girls. The ambience was quaint and  a lot of open space! I had the special of the day which was an omelette with leeks. I was disappointed because the amount of veggies and leeks were very minimal. I could have made this omelette myself at home but had to pay $20 for it. . . Friends got the french toast (which is supposed to be their signature) wasn't that great. It looked like dessert!!!! It was super sweet and just doused in sugar that it was almost inedible. Why would you ruin french toast and construct it to be like a dessert cake? . . I got a side of bacon with my omelette which is the only good thing about the meal because they piled the bacon on. The side of toast was good too, very eggy in flavor. But I don't think I'll be back, it wasn't worth going to just to have mediocre brunch.
Wow, was I excited to have breakfast here! Unfortunately, we didn't have the greatest experience. I've heard so many good things about Bouchon and I expected this breakfast to blow my mind...but no.. . We took a couple of clients to Bouchon for a meeting and to be honest, the waiter was a bit snobby and uptight. He seemed annoyed by us. He was really short and quick with us and didn't seem warm and welcoming at all. . . I ordered the French Toast and I was hugely disappointed. It was just not delicious. I can't believe this, but it wasn't seasoned well. It didn't really taste sweet at all. It was just sort of a bland, mushy type of flavor. Also, my french toast tasted like it was pre-made and heated to order, rather than fresh. So sad! . . I had a side of sausage, which was okay. They tasted barely heated through as well. Not fresh. My colleagues ordered eggs, hash, etc. and none of them had anything great to say either. All in all a huge let down. I was expecting something reminiscent of the French Laundry, and I got something that didn't even really rival Denny's, sad to say.. . Now this might be harsh, maybe I caught a bad dish or a bad day. I'll probably go back, but this was sincerely the experience I had.
We got seated outside by the fountain. Excellent ambience.. . The steak was awesome!!! Oysters are wonderful too.
5 stars for one of my very rare celebrity spottings! We weren't sure what to expect during the very hidden trek to the restaurant, but were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, service, and food. Unfortunately, I can't remember what the actual item I ordered was, but it they had something that tasted like fried mashed potatoes and it was heavenly. The fiance got the french toast bread pudding. They do warn you that's it's very "decadent" and they're not lying. Good, I just want meat and potatoes for every meal though! I love the sunlight that peeks through the large windows. . . I know you're dying to know now who it was that we saw... okay, it was just Kelsey Grammar. My fiance said, "Look! It's Brendan Frasier." Too bad his real name isn't Frasier and the only reason I know his name is because of the Real Housewives. Lame.
Was so excited to go to Bouchon and was thoroughly disappointed. Mainly because of the service. Our appetizers came out quickly and we enjoyed those. It was over 40mins later that we received our salads and soups (and after asking about them twice) and when they came, they forgot one soup and mine was completely cold. . It then took a really long time to get our entrees and that too after asking about it. Our waiter was non existent, the busboys doing most of the serving. . When the entrees arrived mine was completely overdone and when i asked the manager if she thought so, her response was "I don't know, it's dark in here.". They comped up the salads and have us dessert but we just wanted to leave at that point. I asked them to take off my meal which they did, though I could sense they were upset about it. Not as upsetting as getting your meal two hours after you sit down. . Overall, not too pleased and my co workers who wanted to leave much earlier said they would never repeat.
After all the rave reviews I heard, I couldn't help but be a little disappointed.. . I had the foie gras and the truffle risotto. The foie gras was served on top of a some kind of fried potato disc and a fruity sauce (cranberry?). I thought that the potato disc didn't really add much to the dish in terms of flavor. It was a little crunchy, but seemed to be there mainly to absorb the sauce. The sauce did not go very well with the foie grad, as it was a tad too sweet and overwhelmed the taste of the foie gras. . . As for the truffle risotto, it was absolutely delicious, but very rich. The first half of the dish was great, but I'm glad I split it with my boyfriend. . . As for the service, the wait staff was patient and extremely attentive. I would give this 3.5 stars if I could, but don't believe that they deserve 3. . . My boyfriend has even here before, and admits that it wasn't as good as he remembers. It could be just an off day, but I was a bit disappointed with the food.
I frequent the Venetian and Palazzo as they are my go-to hotels whenever I am out in Vegas. I have always passed by this acclaimed restaurant and I finally decided to try it with my boyfriend. Everything we ordered was piquant and an absolute treat. The foie gras goes without saying. The restaurant itself is beautiful and creates a very romantic and intimate setting. I hope to dine here again!
This is one of my go-to places with my wife, mainly because she loves oysters and I would kill for their French onion soup. One of the best things about this place is that I could easily eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. . . For the price, it's pretty unbeatable with choices that aren't always found at all restaurants. . . Try the chicken and waffles for breakfast, get a tonic and gin (not gin and tonic), and the muscles with pomme frites for dinner. . . If you like French onion soup...... Oh baby!
Such a great breakfast!  we had perfect beef hash with eggs on top, poached to perfection.  Sourdough waffles were amazing, especially with the tahitian vanilla butter.  Service is on par with price.  Come here if you want to spend for breakfast, but you will not be disappointed.
Came here for a late lunch and had a croque madame with some bellinis. You really can't go wrong with anything at Bouchon. I've been to the location in Yountville many times, so it was nice to try a different location. Our server was so sweet and the food was very good. Can't wait to come back!
4.5 stars.  We had brunch there this morning. The (spicy) Bloody Mary was awesome. My friends ordered the pastry assortment and the pain du chocolate was fresh and delicious...much better than the one was had in a cafe in Paris (hotel) yesterday. My husband and I both had the Croque Madame and it was superb. We would definitely go back.
Recently came here for the first time for brunch on a Friday morning. Located in the Venetian Hotel & Casino, the actual restaurant is located on the 10th floor of the hotel so you will need to access this place by going on the guest elevator. Plenty of security at each entry to the elevator. Was afraid they were going to ask for room key which would be annoying but I guess during the afternoon it's ok.. . We thought there would be a long line but we were seated right away as there were plenty of seats available around 11am but the restaurant itself was also busy. You can choose to sit outside but we were conveniently seated near the doors to the outside so we still had a good view. We waited for about 10 mins or so because our waitress finally decided if we wanted anything to drink. Odd because when another group walked in and got seated, they were quickly approached by the same waitress right away asking if they wanted anything to drink. Not sure why we had to wait a while before we were approached by our waitress. Service by the waitress could've been better. The other waiters did much better servicing us as we were approached frequently for refills.. . I ordered their Croque Madame which is a grilled ham and cheese sandwich covered in sauce with a fried egg on top with plenty of fries on the side. We also ordered theirBeignet to start off with and my wife ordered their clams with plenty of fries also. You will not need to order their Baguette since they start you off with a nice Baguette with choice of blackberry jam and butter. I recommend the Croque Madame. Great dish if you like grilled ham and cheese sandwich. Plenty of flavor and great with the fried egg on top. Plenty of fries too which makes it hard to stop snacking on. Beignet was delicious as it came with both Nutella and jam. You probably wouldn't need it since it's already covered nicely in caramel. Overall food was great here and I would definitely come back. Hopefully next time better service approaches us.
Came here for Sunday brunch and it was super good. The food tasted amazing and the service was great! My friend and I shared the granola with honey yogurt, croque madame, and waffles. I could eat their granola and honey yogurt every single day.. . I've tried the Bouchon in Beverly Hills and I do believe the one in Vegas is better. I definitely want to come back to try the rest of the menu.
The truffle mac & cheese was sooo... good. Upscale atmosphere and great service!
We came for breakfast, and it wasn't very impressive.  On the upside, the coffee was suberb.  My wife had corned beef hash, which was pretty much as expected.  The poached egg was perfect, there's no doubt about it.  I had the cinnamon oatmeal, which was second rate at best. Very soupy and with rolled oats, whereas I usually have the much superior steel cut oats at home.  They should hire me to make their oatmeal.  Also had the "tropical" fruit salad.  Please.  Mostly cantaloupe and honeydew (both unripe) mixed with a little bit of pineapple,  topped with some banana and sprinkled with a tiny bit of toasted coconut.  Seriously, don't put it on the menu unless you're going to do it properly.  Gordon Ramsay would fire half of the food prep staff on the spot.  Service was excellent,  though!
Relative to the reputation the food did not meet expectations.  Only thing I liked was the bread and French onion soup.  Otherwise the mussel was mediocre and over the top with shallots.  Lamb was undercooked and gammy.  The no chi was potato tots.  Will not come back.  I could not get into napa bouchon but this was a downer.  I love fleur de Lys.  But this is a dissapoinent
