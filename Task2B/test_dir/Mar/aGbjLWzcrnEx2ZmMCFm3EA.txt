Awesome design in the restaurant front with lines of flames in the window. Similar to other restaurants on the strip, they have the system where you leave your number to be texted when a tables almost ready for you. We waited about 40 min but it was well worth it. The blue cheese chicken wing appetizer was solid and the burgers were very strong as well. My farm burger (duck breast bacon, sharp English cheddar, and fried egg) was cooked perfectly and the service was good as well. Drink menu offered via iPad which was a cool touch as well. Pricey but definitely pay a visit if you get a chance
Delicious! Best-friend and I came here because we had been watching a lot of Gordon Ramsay and wanted to try out his food. I ordered an American Cheeseburger since I'm pregnant and can't have most of the cheeses on the burgers and didn't want to kill the taste of the burger by asking for a different cheese. My friend ordered the farm burger. We split the parmesan truffle fries. . . My burger was good! The meat alone was delicious. My friend really liked hers. The fries and the aioli sauce that comes with it were sooooo good! Prices aren't bad either. The soda is $4 which is kinda crazy. Both our burgerswere $13 I think. Fries were $8 and just one order was enough for us both. . . Despite it being so good, I don't feel like it was the most amazing burger ever and I can never eat a burger anywhere else ever again haha. But those fries definitely want me to come back!
Great food good menu they had vegetarian options I got a kale salad delicious price was reasonable prices especially for las vegas I will sure to dine here again also got a little coupon for staying at planet hollywood. If your looking for good food great prices and service stop here. Fyi it is all burgers its a burger
I loved GORDON RAMSAY BurGR! We went on a Wednesday night so the wait was only about five minutes. We sat and were given an iPad full of choices of booze and a little fold out menu for the food.. . BurGR has a very decent craft beer selection, which pleased me. I had a Squatters Hop Rising and a Stone Ruination, both on tap. We also ordered the fresh roasted jalapeno poppers. Man, those poppers were good, but way too frickin hot for me. And I had chapped lips to boot! Ouch!. . For the main course I had the simple Gordon Ramsay Cheeseburger and an order of the Sweet Potato Fries. The burger was excellent! But those fries were served with a shaker of powdered sugar and chipotle mayo. They were easily the best sweet potato fries I've ever had.. . Between great beer choices, bomb sides and hearty burgers... I'm a fan! . . 4.5 stars!
HOLY MOLY BATMAN this place has the best FISH sandwich I have had in my entire life! Yes best fish sandwich that has entered my mouth...Now why would someone order a fish sandwich at a burger place? Well it is simple:  Upon walking into the restaurants I noticed the burgers that were being served and yes they looked awesome, but my one pet-peeve about burgers is when they are stacked skyscraper high...I prefer to hit the "Easy Button" when I eat burgers and those burgers looked delicious but difficult to eat. So I audible to the fish sandwich, with french fries, and my wife ordered the truffle fries. (We will get to the fries later) . . The fish sandwich is very fresh, light, crispy on the outside, but juicy and tender on the inside, they top it with thin crunchy chips for a unique texture, and the homemade tartar sauce is just blissful.  . . I would recommend skipping the truffle fries since I couldn't taste the difference in them compared to the normal fries, and the normal fries come with a smoky chipotle ketchup which is mouth watering (not given with the truffle fries).  . . This is place is definitely worth the 15-20 minutes it takes to get seated, trust me you won't be disappointed. Next time I want to try to their milkshakes, those looked extra yummy as well.
MMMMM pretty yummy! Some odd sounding burgers.but pretty good. I regret not stepping out of the box and ordering some thing else.
This place has for sure become my FAVORITE burger place here in Vegas!!! I love their burgers!! But I hate their wait!!! It gets really packed sometimes with a crazy line outside and they do NOT take reservations : (. Yet I will still go there and wait to have a burgers.. I have liked the appetizers I had tried there like the onion ring tower,and  jalapeno poppers, BUT I do think the appetizers are really worth it for the price... but that could be me because I am not crazy about fried food groups. . Service and staff are excellent!!! AND THEIR SHAKES!!!
Un des tres bons burgers que j'ai mange. Les a cotes comme les frites peuvent tres bien etre partages puisque les portions sont genereuses. Je m'attendais a plus cher etant donne la reputation de monsieur Ramsey et du fait que c'est Vegas, mais nous nous en sommes sorti pour 35$ chacun (2 burgers, 2 a cotes et 2 sodas). Nous avons en plus recu un excellent service. A essayer!
Easily the best burger I've ever had! EVER!. . I went on a Saturday with the boyfriend and luckily the wait for 2 was about 40 minutes. Could've been seated within 20 minutes but we decide to wait for a table. Be sure to check in at the front before you wait in the line they have marked off. The line was only for parties of 2. If you had 3 or more the wait was about 2 and a half hours long. (note to self: never come with a party of 3 or more). . Moving on to the food. We got onion rings for an appetizer. The onion rings were amazing. I'm not usually a big fan of onion rings because I hate when I take one bite the whole onion ends up coming out of the bread and I'm left with just bread and no onion inside. Their onion rings are a different story. They didn't feel oily like other onion rings as well. The dipping sauce made them taste even better.. . I got the Farm Burger, which I highly highly recommend. It comes with duck breast bacon (never had this before but it was delicious), English sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. My boyfriend got the Uber Cheese Burger which just came with three different cheeses. Sounded really plain but it was the best plain burger I've had. Both burgers were so moist and full of flavors. Thinking about it makes me want to drive up to Vegas right now just for the burgers. We also ordered the truffle fries. They were good but I've had better truffle fries before.. . Overall our dinner experience was wonderful. Our total came out to be about $68 that's with 2 beers, an appetizer, 2 burgers, and a side of fries. We were way past full at the end of the meal so we weren't able to try the dessert. Which just means we'll have to go back. . . This place is definitely my top recommendation for anyone staying in Vegas.
I am still fantasizing about those jalapeno poppers - wow, they were delicious. The first time they came out, however, they were still ice cold in the middle. Gordon wouldn't approve! The burgers were really, tasty. Our server was absolutely great. We will be back in Vegas soon, and are definitely coming back.
The entrance to Burgr is awesome, the flames fill a glass wall enticing you to come in. . . Jalapeno poppers were an awesome starter, warning, they are spicy, not like the frozen ones at your grocery store. They each come in a small individual glass with dipping sauce. . . We got a bottle of red Terra Valentine wine which paired well with our burgers. I had the Euro Burger as I'm a fan of goat cheese, which tasted excellent with the beef. All the flavors combined with the cheese, truffle aioli, arugula and tomato created an orgasmic flavor. The size is quite large for being a gourmet burger. . . I would've given 5 stars except the wait staff were a bit slow for it not being so busy.
The service was super super slow.. We set down for a good 15 minutes before we were even given water.. The food was just okay I wouldn't recommend this place
Amazingly delish!  Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, medium, with asadero cheese + roasted jalapeno peppers + avocado & oven roasted tomato.  Layers of FLAVOR!  Paired it with Truffle Parmesan Fries, hand cut style, must try!  For dessert, we had the coffee shake topped with creme brulee pudding. The prices were reasonable for the gourmet quality style and the service was friendly and fun.  If you like burgers, you will love these!!!  I would definitely recommend on your next visit to Planet Hollywood Las Vegas.
Greeted nicely and promptly when we arrived. Service was polite and good, food was very pricey: 2 burgers, wings, 3 beers...$70 plus tip...WOW!. . Typically I don't mind paying and never complain about price, I just think this was way over the top.
Service was polite and friendly, short wait to get in but I noticed they've perfected the art of flipping tables. They're very efficient here.. . The food: really good Britannia burger but not mind blowing. The regular fries I had were standard issue but the ketchup with coconut? in it was a nice touch.. . WAY overpriced. For $14 for the burger only, it better be "man sized" or "blow your mind" and this one was neither. I mean, be expensive but not greedy, we're already paying a premium to eat your food. Had I not had fries, I would have left hungry still.. . I think you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else that you'd pay $45 (with tip) for a burger, fries and 2 beers.
When there is a line of 50+ you know it has to be good, especially since Gordon Ramsey put his name on it!  I had the Brittania Burger and my friend had the Euro burger.  SO GOOD! Vegas is a dump, but this restaurant rocked.  We were in town for WPPI and didn't want to venture far from the MGM.  Good choice.
This place is awesome! Fun atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable price! FYI if you are a Diamond or Seven Stars member of the Ceasars Rewards program they have reserved tables for you and you don't have to wait in line. I tried this the second to last day of my stay and like itso much went back for lunch the next day. The Hummus is amazing, and it comes with pita and assorted veggies to dip.  The veggies are unique, I couldn't really tell exactly what they were but I think I had a baby yellow carrot. It bursted with flavor. We also tried the chicken sliders, they were just the right size. The chicken was perfectly cooked an moist. I usually don't like chicken in restaurants because they over cook it and make it dry. The day prior we had a burger that had some type of chutney on it and we added avocado. Wow!!!! No wonder this place is called BurgR they got it down!!! If you come here make sure you try a burger even if you have to split with someone because you are missing out otherwise. Now both I got the wings as well. They have a unique sauce on them that also goes well with the fries. We ordered extra. Don't worry they aren't too spicy at all in fact the flavor is so unique you will just keep eating them trying to figure out exactly what makes them so delicious. The service here is top notch. The men all wear jeans, and nice clean cut form fitting shirts. And the women had either skirts or pants. It was cute because all wore uniforms but not your typical uniforms. And they sported them like they enjoyed wearing them as well. All the waiters and waitress's appeared to be in athletic shape and well groomed. The service was impeccable and they constantly insured we were well taken care of. I will probably get something here upon every stay now. Delicous! Awesome Job to the Gordon Ramsay Burger Team! You are all doing amazing!!!!
Ramsay's BurGR is hands down the best burger restaurant I've eaten at in Vegas. One word of caution, BurGR does not take reservations, so expect a long wait. We went on a Saturday night and had about an hour and 20 minute wait. They takeyour phone number and text you when your table is ready, so you can walk around the casino or the miracle mile shops while you're waiting.  Now on to the food:. . Fries and Onion Rings - We were really hungry, so we did an order of the truffle fries and the onion rings as appetizers.  The fries are thick and hand-cut, I usually prefer thinner fries but these were very good.  Plus, they came with a killer truffle aioli sauce that was simply amazing.  The aioli was so good that my wife asked for a side of it to put on her burger.  The onion rings were beer-battered and almost tempura-style, so they were nice and crispy.  The maui onions gave them a good flavor and they came with a tasty homemade ranch sauce.. . Burgers - Per our server's recommendation, I had the Farm burger (duck bacon, cheddar, fried egg) and it was amazing.  The meat was juicy and a perfect pink medium throughout, the fried egg was runny and just added to the juiciness of the burger.  The duck bacon added a nice flavor, it tasted a bit like pastrami.    My wife had the Chanterelle, which came smothered in a delicious onion jam.  . . Shakes & Dessert - The shakes here are very unique as the come with pudding as the top layer.  It's an interesting combination that just works, our Shake #1 (caramel pudding & chocolate ice cream) was so good I wanted another one!  For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding pops, which I would not get again.  They come with a peanut ice cream that is extremely peanutty and kind of overwhelming.  The sticky toffee is frozen and chewy and doesn't really have any flavor at all.  I would definitely skip the toffee pops and stick with the shakes.  . . Service was good throughout our meal, and we even had a manager stop by and chat with us for a few minutes.  Overall it was a fantastic experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone that loves burgers.
Food is fantastic...think "gourmet burger". It'll run you around $14 or so for a burger but they are creatively put together and taste great. Salads and fries are amazing as well. The biggest complaint I have is that the wait can get excessively long and when you peek into the restaurant and see all the empty tables it can get frustrating. Not sure if they are just not properly staffing the place or the fact that the waitresses spend 10 minutes using an iPad to try to upsell you that is causing the delay, but all in all the service was just ok, while the food was great!
OMG, so yummy.... lol We got reg cheeseburgers, they were cooked perfectly, one order of steak fries which were plenty for us. we will definitely return next time i'm in vegas. ; )
The blue cheese burger was amazing. Still craving it 2 days later. No appetizer is needed as the portions are huge.  Go with the onion rings over the fries and be sure to save some room for the pudding shakes. . . Great waitstaff, prompt, courteous and all the recommendations were spot on.
Oh my goodness. These burgers certainly lived up to the hype. My boyfriend and I shared onion rings to start off the meal. The breading was a little thick for my liking but they were super crispy and fresh out of the fryer. I loved the freshly gratedParmesan on top and the cheesy ranch dipping sauce was tasty. Now the burgers. My boyfriend and I shared the Hell's Kitchen burger and the farm burger. We got both medium rare, which we had never had before. The meat was a bit softer than we had expected but well seasoned and the most flavorful patties I've ever tasted. Next time we would probably get them medium well or well done for texture. I loved the Hell's Kitchen burger which had a slice of avocado, melted white cheese, roasted peppers and tomato, which I thought was a perfect combination. The roasted peppers and tomato gave a great flavor and juicy freshness which made the burger seem a bit lighter. The farm burger was also superb. I loved the egg on top but the duck bacon could have been crispier. The only thing missing on this decadent burger was some crisp lettuce which would have definitely helped balance the rich flavors. The buns was also buttery and delicious. Next time we come to Vegas we'll definitely try one of the dawgs, which we saw someone else get and looked really good, as well as one of those gigantic shakes!
We only had to wait 20 mins to get seated.  The onion rings are the bomb.  We split the fish sandwich and it was the best ever.   I couldn't believe how good the and fresh the bread was.  The parmesan fries were ok.  Ill definitely be back!!!
Great place for a fabulous burger!  The onion rings are so good!  My husband and I shared the farm burger and the honey-pig bao buns.  The burger was cooked perfectly... Excellent quality ingredients.  The egg was perfect with a runny yolk, duck bacon... Whatever it was good... My only critique is the meat could've used a touch of salt... I'm not sure if it was seasoned.  The bao buns were Tasty! We went right at noon on a Tuesday and sat at the bar.  The lined formed shortly after we arrived.  Of all the burger places to choose from I'm glad we cam here!!
Beware of the "Hog Burger". . During my recent stay in Las Vegas, we stopped at "Ramsy Burgr" for lunch and I ordered the Hog Burger.  The waitress told me they were served medium (lightly pink inside) and since I never had one before I accepted this.  When the "burger" arrived and I took my first bite! I thought it to be awfully rare and not necessarily tasty.  After a couple more bites I started to be concerned that I was eating raw pork, so I pinch a bit of the meat in the center of what remained and indeed it was a raw as raw can be! Yuck! The waitress confirmed my concern immediately and returned five minutes or so later with a new burger.  By that time my appetite was gone, concerned a food born illness was in my future!  Can you say trichinosis?. . One would think if your business is to prepare and "cook" food, one would be "good" at it, especially a burger place.  Heck , I am no chef, but I can out cook most restaurants these days with their tasteless expensive creations! . . Anyway, the "cooked" hog burger was not worth the wait and I found the apple butter and arugula as toppings to be conflicting tastes.  Also, no accommodations were made to our check for this inconvenience.  I would not return again, but others at the table seemed satisfied with their meals.  Nice location on the strip and connected to Hard Rock Hotel. Pricey for what you get, but inline with Las Vegas these days.
We went on a Sunday night. They quoted a 45 minute wait but it ended up only being about 25. The burgers were spot on! We both enjoyed our meal & would definitely recommend it to other burger enthusiasts. My burger had mozzarella, avocado & bacon. The fries were great too! It was convenient also since we were staying at Planet Hollywood.
Had a 30 minute wait to get in but the time went by quickly as there is a lot to see and do around the restaurant.  I had the Uber Cheeseburger and truffle fries.  My friends had the Hells Kitchen but said it was not hot or spicy.  Burgers are over priced but they have good flavor and great buns!!  The truffle fries are worth every penny and the best I've ever had.  Ended up paying $30 for burger, fries, and an iced tea.
I am a huge Chef Gordon Ramsey fan, so naturally I was excited to eat here. The wait was very long. Service was 3.5 out of 5. The food was a s solid 3. The dessert was a 4. Although I feel like I'm committing treason, I can't give them higher than a 3.5 because the burger wasn't the best I had during my stay and the server seemed a little bothered by my visit.
WOWZIE DOWZIE!!! Yum yum go get you some! This place is delish. The only reason I didn't do 5 stars is because it was super loud, but hey man you're on the strip- what do you expect right? So we started with the jalapeno poppers. They are served in shot glasses of ranch and a drizzle of a hot pepper sauce. So. Damn. Good. Perfect presentation also- no double dipping, and no man handling of the apps to find the perfect popper. My sister had the spicy hot dog. I think they might case the sausages actually in house. Best quality hot dog I have ever tasted. I had the house burger that came with fire roasted tomato, queso fresco, and chiles. The meat was perfect. The toppings on my burger reminded me of a chile relleno. Our server was awesome- quick& cheerful. We were with a big group so we ordered the parmesan oinion rings, truffle fries, natural fries, and sweet potato fries. They were all stellar. They serve them all with housemade sauces, and the sweet potato fries have a tiny shaker of powdered sugar. I read another review that was complaining about no reservations? We did have reservations, and they took us right on time :) Gordon Ramsey seems kinda douchey on TV, but his BurGR restaurant is freaking GREAT. Love it :) YUM YUM YUM
Have you ever bit into something and your eyes rolled back in your head?  Well, maybe not to that extreme, but I did get this feeling that came over me when I bit into the onion ring.   Biting into the burger, I got a similar sensation.  It was excellent.  The next day I went back to try the fish sandwich (we were staying in the hotel).  While I didn't get a rush, it was good and had a quite interesting presence.  Oh, I didn't mention the duck bacon on the burger.  This was my first experience with duck bacon.  It was quite tasty.  It wasn't crispy or anything like pork bacon, just a piece of meat that added more flavor to the burger.  . . Let's see...what else...Oh, service...Very friendly. The first night there was a wait of about 20 minutes, not too bad.  Second visit was the lunch hour and we walked right in.  This was a Sunday night and Monday afternoon, respectfully.  Servers were pretty quick with the food, but we had to wait for ice tea to brew .  By the time the tea finally came, we were done.  Oh, I forgot the jalapeno poppers I got the second visit.   They were okay.  I love spice, so I wanted to try them.  I didn't particularly like the breading.  They seemed to be popular though, but I wouldn't order them again.. . So that's it til next time "Loss Wages"!
Shake #5, coffee shake with chocolate hazelnut pudding is just something else. But who knows, maybe my friends and I were in a delirious haze after 2 nights of Vegas and anything cold and caffeinated tasted good at that point ;) But honestly, I really liked the pudding that tops off the shake, which is what made it soooo good! . . I also had the damnation chicken burger which had its pros and cons. Pros-- the chicken patty was seasoned and grilled perfectly! I've never really had a ground chicken patty that's moist and flavorful. Cons- the fiery mayo sauce was kind of nonexistent and the blue cheese was overpowering. I think they may have been a bit heavy handed with it...or I'm just more sensitive to blue cheese than I thought. . . My friend got the same burger but with blue cheese on the side and she enjoyed it a lot more. Anyway, I can't really come to a burger place and complain about their chicken burgers :) Everyone in my group who got an ACTUAL burger (beef)  loved it. Hope to be back to try some of the other things on the menu!
I'm torn about this place. On the one hand, the food is really good but on the other hand the prices are ridiculous. My meal was $35 before tax and tip. So ignoring the prices, the 4-star rating is just for the food. . . I ordered the farm burger, truffle fries, and Shake #5. I also sampled the jalapeno poppers, soba noodle salad, and sweet potato fries. The burger was really really good and the meat was a perfectly cooked medium! I loved the combination of the duck breast bacon, cheddar, and fried egg on the burger. Although I did feel like I needed some sort of greenery, maybe arugula? The fries were thick and crispy. The truffle parmesan and truffle salt on the fries made it too salty though; it could do with far less seasoning. The shake was incredible! It was creamy and super thick and surprisingly not overly sweet. . . The jalapeno poppers were yummy but were a kick in the mouth. They were so spicy! I was not expecting my mouth to be on fire. The soba noodle salad was cold and refreshing but if I'm going to BurGR, I'm going to order a burger. The sweet potato fries we nothing extraordinary. I was really thrown off by the dipping sauce. It tasted kind of like vanilla pudding but it was supposed to be a honey jalapeno mayo? Weird.... . Definitely give BurGR a try because I think it should be experienced at least once.
Love the very modern look and feel of the restaurant. The square plates and unique shape of the utensils were very interesting.  We ordered and expensive tea, but it was fresh brewed and really hit the spot.  We decided to start with an appetizer of "Fury of Chicken Wings" - amazing - loved the sweet/hot sauce and the crunchiness of the wings. Great flavor!!! We ordered The Blue Cheese Burger and the Umber Burger.  Wow! Great flavor.  Great mix on the Blue Cheese based on the reviews we did decide to indulge with the Parmesan Fries.  They were delicious but we over ordered by that point and could not eat many.  It was expensive - no doubt about it.....we could have easily halved a burger and cut out the tea and that would have saved us around 23. Bucks.  It was worth it and worth tasting his yummy food!
farm burger amazing got coffee shake...heaven in a glass, there was a mix up with our appetizer didn't come til after the  burgers,  manager was right at our table comped the apps! Amazing! Really value their customers! Will come again for sure, my husband got the Chicken Burger, hands down best Chicken sandwich of his life!
VISIT! ASAP! ... and let me know which is better: their service or their food.. . A group of girls and I got lucky and only had to wait 45 minutes for a table (and this was on a Saturday night). Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and he had a great attitude, very patient. We loved the interactive menu on the iPad that showed pictures of the drinks and merchandise for sale.  I don't know where to start with reviewing the food... We ordered the sweet potato and truffle Parmesan fries. The sauces that came with them were a perfect pairing. My one friend and I shared the Euro and Chanterelle Burgers. I don't want to talk about them; they were that good.
Since it's opening, it has become a must-do whenever we are in Vegas. Have tried 3 different burgers, all were amazing. Love the curry and chipotle katsups that come with the thick cut fries. Tried a shake for the first time on our last visit. It tasted delicious, but the pudding on top was an unexpected surprise. Expect a long wait at regular meal times. I always grab a pen at the end-- one more touch I love (twice our waitress brought more pens for us)
There farm burger is massive. As you can see from the pictures that have been posted by otters. i enjoyed eating it... it was a good meal at an affordable price...5 stars to everyone!
Yes, one million times yes! We stopped in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and got a table immediately. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about the food but not about the beer (I was unfamiliar with Boddington's and asked if it was a light beer and she asked if I meant "light in color or..." and then told me it was dark. Thankfully I asked for a sample and decided on something else). We ordered two Farm Burgers, which don't come with fries, so we got the truffle parmesan fries too. The burgers were cooked perfectly, one medium and one medium rare, and the toppings were fantastic. The Farm Burger has cheddar, a fried egg, and duck bacon and it was the absolute perfect combination! The fries were great too, served with a few dipping sauces (the aioli is the best).. . Truthfully the food here was better than the food we got at Gordon Ramsay Steak. I wish Gordon would open a BurGR on the east coast because I really wanted to try the Hell's Kitchen burger too! This is on our list to come back to when we return to Vegas.
Huge wait - I think I stood in line for nearly an hour! Server was friendly and seated us quickly once we got to the front though. While standing in line, you might want to stay a bit further from the giant fireplace thing - it's really warm next to it, despite how "cool" it is. Unintended pun.. . Anyways, I was just thinking about giving this place a 3 because the burgers are nothing special and mine was overcooked, the shakes are decent (adding pudding to them is delicious), and the sweet potato fries were industry standard (with an excellent sauce, but the powdered sugar was not necessary).... . ...but then I remembered the Jalapeno Poppers. Most certainly the best jalapeno popper I've ever had in my entire life. Roasting the jalapeno takes the bitterness of the pepper off, while mellowing out the spiciness a bit. The cheese was deliciously melted when you bit into the popper, which was also nicely fried and crunchy. The choice to use half a jalapeno prevents the possible "slide out", as well as making sure the cheese is the first flavor to come through, and not overwhelmed. And lastly, the hellfire ranch sauce the poppers are served in couldn't be beat - housemade ranch with hot sauce? Bomb.com. . Make sure you bring your TotalRewards Card! You can get $1 off every item you order (which should just be 2 jalapeno poppers and a milkshake, forget the burgers).
I walked in here to try out a burger, but after my best friend getting food poising from a burger the night before I changed my mind and got a salad instead.. . The chicken noodle salad to be exact.. . It was heavenly. It had avocado's, edamame, noodles, and other spicy things that made my mouth sing.. . I was seated straight away at the bar - this could be because I was on my own which was great because I was on time restrictions being that I needed to fly out of Vegas that afternoon.. . The guy behind the bar was lovely and attentive. . . However I guess you come here for the food no? Worth a visit.
I wasn't sure if the long line was going to be worth it but it is.  Everyone is super friendly,  helpful and that wasn't the best part.  As a burger eating person I can tell you it was the best burger I've ever had.   Juicy, flavorful and absolutely perfect.  I had a shake and it was just as amazing.  Then you add fries and you couldn't ask for a better meal.  Powered sugar on fries was strange but everything went perfectly together.  Say what you want about Gordon Ramsay but he's a genius.
My husband had to work so I went on my own.  Sat at the bar, and was happy the bartenders were friendly.  I asked what cider they had on tap and was given an option of pear, and apple (angry orchard).  Thank you to Raul who was pleasant, amiable, and knowledgeable.. . I enjoyed my Hell's Kitchen burger.  The cheese was delicious, and the jalapano was very tasty.  I did have an issue with the jalapeno size.  It was left whole (butterflied) and when I took the first bite if my burger I pulled the entire pepper out.. . As a side note, the fries are DEFINITELY a share-between-two-people size.  Possibly three.
Im a huge fan of GR ... and the food here was really good  - burger cooked to perfection... but 14 bucks for a burger and you don't even get fries with that???. . The burger is good - but its not 14 dollars good. . . the coffee milkshake is amazing
Amazing food! Yes the wait was long, but most buffets and restaurants have long waits on a Sunday. Our waiter wasn't just friendly, but also knew about everything on the menu and gave us some great recommendations. I ended up ordering the Farm Burger and truffle fries. You have to try it. Delicious! Definitely coming back to try the other burgers on their menu and to get more of their fries!
Have to go with a three star here. Service was great the food was hit or miss. I've had better burgers here in Philly. . . Michelle, the MIL and I noticed a long line along the side of the restaurant so I approached the hostess stand and asked for a table. We were seated immediately so I have no idea why there was this long strange line. . . Perused the menu and the cool IPad drink menu and off we went. A nice selection of brews fromaround the world. Ordered the truffle Parmesan fries with the truffle aioli. Let me tell you how good these fries were and that aioli. I probably could have put that on a turd and it would be fantastic. I wanted to bathe in it. Also ordered the onion rings with chipolte ketchup and cheddar ranch dip. Again solid option, Nice and crisp with just the right bite. The girls went with the blue burgers and I the the hog burger. The hog was mangalitsa pork, english sharp cheddar, apple butter and arugula. Nice flavor but wasn't that impressed. We did not order dessert. . . Overall it was good but we've had better burgers back at home.
I stopped by this place with some coworkers. The wait was crazy long and finally we got seated after 2 hours. The burgers were decent and drinks were OK. I am not sure what the hype is but the gourmet burgers are pricey and not that great.
The burgers are delicious. The fries are amazing. But what really got me....the wings! They were so delicious I regret not ordering more!
Can one really stand out when just sitting in the middle of the crowd? There are celebrity eateries everywhere in Las Vegas, and gourmet burgers are a dime a dozen. . . Well, more like 1560 dimes a dozen. These things really aren't cheap.. . I get it, this is not a typical burger. In fact, I went with the Farm Burger, which was topped with duck breast bacon and an egg. Truth is, at the $14 price tag (saving a buck by showing my players club card), it failed to knock my socks off. I will happily pay $14 for hosiery loosening masticable delectables, but alas, my footwear was left firmly in place.. . My belt did need to be loosened a bit though.... . The Truffle Parmesan Fries at $11 were the real star, and the one order was plenty for our table. The creme brulee pudding and oreo shake made a fine accompaniment, even at $8. But when it came to the 3 vs. 4 star question, I found my self asking: will I be coming back?. . There are just so many other places to try. Places that stand above the crowd, carrying the socks they knocked off, filled with my hard earned dimes.
GORDON RAMSAY TREBLE. . Joe's Cable Car vs. Gordon Ramsay BurGR. (like Hawaii vs. Georgia in the Sugar Bowl). . Last month I went to Vegas and ate at two Gordon Ramsay's eatery: Pub & Grill (Caesars Palace) and Steak (Paris Las Vegas). I was never able eat at his burger joint. If I ever went back to Vegas this burger joint was one of my destination. Well that day came this Tuesday. . In another matter last week I ate at a San Francisco burger intuition Joe's Cable Car that had been opened for over 40 years, but closed it's doors for good last Sunday. My eating experience at Joe's Cable Car was comical because the burger was a rip off. I'm a big fan of mom and pop eateries as long as they don't charge "big boy" prices. By charging those type of prices suggest their food is world class. If that's the case their food should be scrutinized. Is it unfair to compare a burger from a mom and pop versus a Michelin Star? From the outset yes, but if the prices are similar no. If I had to put a sport analogy it would be during the BCS college football era where mid major schools that were undefeated during the regular season would lobby to get into a BCS bowl game. Those teams who do get to play in a BCS bowl games better show up against their opponents otherwise they will get embarrassed and be ridiculed for their BCS birth. A great example is the 2008 Sugar Bowl where Hawaii, a mid major team, was blown out by Georgia. . . However going to Joe's Cable Car provided me a great reference what to order at Gordon Ramsay BurGR. There are a lot of different varieties of burgers at Gordon Ramsay BurGR, but I wanted a burger that was similar in style to Joe's Cable Car for comparison. In fact I ordered 3 items as I did at Joe's Cable Car: a burger, fries, and soft drink. At Gordon Ramsay BurGR I ordered an American Burger, a side of fries that included chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup, and a Pepsi. The American Burger was the closest thing I can find that was similar to the burger I ordered at Joe's Cable Car - a straightforward burger with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions topped with American cheese. But that's where the similarities end between those two burgers. Even though I requested both burgers to be cooked medium rare the American Burger was moist and juicy while the burger at Joe's Cable Car was dry and pasty. I enjoyed every bite of this American Burger. All I got is one question. Joe how can a Brit make an American classic better than you? The dipping sauces of chipolte ketchup and curry ketchup were tangy and delicious for the fries. . . But here's the kicker. The price I paid at Joe's Cable Car was about $26. The price I paid at Gordon Ramsay BurGR was about $24. While the burger at Joe's Cable Car was served in a plastic plate, the American Burger at Gordon Ramsay BurGR was served on an actual plate. . . Now you see why if a mom and pop place charges "big boy" prices they should be scrutinized? If you're to compare your eating establishment to Michelin Star's owned restaurant you better be Boise State and Hawaii. The burger eating experience at Joe's Cable Car and Gordon Ramsay BurGR was as if I was watching Hawaii vs Georgia in the Sugar Bowl - a total blowout where one team shouldn't have been on the same field.
Came here with a group of 9, the patron was nice and put us in two tables next to each other to minimize our wait time. . . I had the Chanterelle Burger which consisted of chanterelle mushroom, argula and figgy onion jam. The burger was on the sweeter side due to the jam but oh my gosh, it's finger-licking good! I also took a few bites off my boyfriend's Farm Burger, which I actually recommend!! Duck breast bacon, fried egg and cheddar...you can't go wrong with this. Also, I order my burger well done, yet it was still really moist and delicious! . . To wash these all down, order a shake! The shake is super thick and creamy...like super creamy! No lumpy ice, no chunky ice cream...just thick, creamy and huge in a delicoius way!
I really didn't find the burgers here interesting or exciting. I ordered the farm burger, medium-rare, and it came out medium-well and a little dry. I think there are much better burgers around the area (Holsteins and Bachi Burger come to mind). I did really, really like the truffle aioli that came with the truffle parmesan fries though. That was spectacular. But overall, considering the burger itself and the service (terrible, we were waiting around forever for our check), I would only come back if there was no wait.
Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and substituted beef for chicken...it was the best burger ever!
Great location at PH every time i'm in Vegas i have to go to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR!! burgers are awesome 1st time there i tried the Britannia BurGR - Sharp Cheddar + Mango Chutney + Arugula  with Truffle Parmesan Fries and this weekend i tired the Farm BurGR! Duck Breast Bacon + English Sharp Cheddar + Fried Egg = Delicious! . cant wait till i go back!!!
I initially wanted to eat here just so I could satisfy my inner Ramsay and scream "These burgers are a f'in joke, you donkeys" when they brought the food out. But alas, it wasn't.  In fact, it was flat out awesome.  Despite my temptation to just say 'Yes' and hand the menu back, I settled on  the Uber Cheeseburger and an order of Just Fries.  First the cheeseburger: ordered medium, it was cooked perfectly with a juicy pink cooked warm throughout and served on a soft multi seeded bun.  Served simply and covered in Fontina, Reclette and Goat cheeses, it was wonderful despite the price.  But hey it's Vegas, it's Ramsay and it's darn good.  The Just Fries were just delicious as well.  Well cooked and lightly seasoned potato wedges served with Chipolte Kethcup and Curry Ketchup; I found my self using the extra ketchup as a dipping sauce for the last few bites of my burger. Service was great, helpful, informative.  Can't wait to come back and try the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Sweet Potato Fries!
Great bar service here, Raul and Jeff were awesome. Recommendations on point, a must eat place. Everything was delicious....and it was nice to see people "doing there job." Burgr seemed to be a well oiled machine with a staff that looked happy. I loved the modern text when your seating is ready set up instead of the 1990's pager lol.... This was one stop ill definitely make every time I'm in vegas.
Awesome place! The burgers are some of the best we have had. We have been there twice. Yeah it is a bit pricey but you are getting higher quality gourmet burgers. If you want a standard burger go somewhere else. We had the uber cheese burger... Sooo delish! Hubby had the farm burger last time with duck bacon that he said was phenomenal. The parmesan french fries are worth the splurge and the truffle aioli served with it is divine! . Highly recommend.
Finally.  A world class burger.  Quality, not quantity here folks.  Tender and delicious...
I came to BurGR without having any sort of expectations and left only mildly impressed.  The name and the glitz surely pulls you in and upon reading the menu my interest definitely spiked.  With burger components that include chanterelle mushrooms, raclette cheese and duck bacon how could it go wrong?. . Well, I can't say it went wrong but my Farm burger was a little underwhelming on flavor.  Fried egg, cheddar and duck bacon lacking in flavor?!?!  Common Vinh!That's what I asked myself as well... maybe it was an off burger, maybe it was because my egg yolk was broken upon serving but overall the burger was just pretty good.  In fact the general consensus of the table was that the meal overall was just pretty good.  Even the much lauded Oreo shake with creme brulee pudding was a bit of a let down, sure it's labeled as pudding but adding some sugar and actually bruleeing the top would really be a great kicker. . . That being said, there were some highlights.  The chili (pepper) dog was impressive and very satisfying and the onion rings had a great crunchy shell.  But taking into consideration the long wait for the table (which is totally understandable) and the 30 minute ticket time, it all seems a bit long and really drags the meal down.  Especially considering that the management staff must know they get slammed everyday.. . Service was attentive and energetic without being overbearing.  Pricing is about right for being an elevated burger joint.  I would say give it a try, especially if you don't come from a town that has been hit by the burger trend.  Having more than my fair share of burgers from many parts of the country and my home town of LA, BurGR is just par for the course.
Came here at night after we had gone to dayclub.. The wait was an hour and a half long! But we still stayed. There was a mishap with our name not being written down, but the hostess was nice enough to put us down for the amount of time we had left, it was still a good half hour still. The big fiery sign was definitely eye catching.. . Service was alright, a lot of servers but being so busy, it was ridiculously hard to get our server when we needed them.. . My boyfriend and I ordered:. - Creme brulee Oreo milkshake: loved the creme brulee on top, speckled with vanilla beans, but it was too thick to mix in with the creamier Oreo Shake at the bottom. . . - Truffle Parmesan fries: wasn't a huge fan of the steak fries, we prefer skinny fries.. But that truffle aioli though, with bits of what seems to be mushrooms, loved the fragrance of the truffle. .  . - Chanterelle burger: burger was cooked to a medium rare, added fontina cheese so it a great addition. The saltiness of the mushrooms paired well with the arugula and sweet onion jam. Not a huge fan of sesame seed bun, but if it works, it works.... . - Euro burger: my bf loved this! He literally inhaled the burger before I could blink.. He especially loved the goat cheese in it, which surprised me, cause he usually doesn't like that pungent smell of the cheese. And the truffle aioli was a plus. The aroma of the truffle was so enticing.. . As hungover as we were from dayclub, we enjoyed every bite, even though I could only eat like half, definitely can tell the quality of the burgers. But expect a ridiculous wait... An hour plus, but on the plus side, being at planet Hollywood, you can always get some gambling in or grab a drink while you wait!
Took my parents here for lunch last time they were in town and had a blast. Ashley was our server and did an amazing job. She walked us through the menu and gave us suggestions on how to enjoy our experience to the fullest! We started out with the jalapeno poppers... I got the hot one, I had a farm burger, my wife a euro burger, my mom a chicken burger, and my dad an all American. We shared the sweet potato fries which were tasty!! Awesome place with awesome service and food!!
The Hell's Kitchen burger was okay and nothing to write home about.  The parmesan fries were good.   The wait is crazy long.
We came here on a Tuesday night and ordered . 1 Oreo shake 9. 2. Chicken sliders, 12. 3. Hell's kitchen burgr 14. 4. Truffle parmesan fires 11. for $58. . - The GR in BurGR is Gordon Ramsey! HAHA. It's not a typo. LOL. ok ok, I know u know that. . -  We came to eat here around 11pm, which was great timing because the wait time was roughly 15min. How it worked for us was that we had to talk to the hostess so that we can make the reservation. I gave her my number, and then she said that she will text us. I got the text in 10min, then had to wait in line next to the fire display for 5min. I thought that was pretty efficient. It gave me some time to scope the tables, haha! Although I hate playing blackjack in PH, horrible odds, unless you play high limit, but that is besides the point. . - Anyway, we got seated in between a couple and a group of 4, which almost seemed like too close for comfort, but was alright. Neither group was loud and annoying if you know what I mean. Haha. - The waitress started us off by showing their drink menu on an iPad which I thought was pretty amazing. We did get the Oreo shake which was so delicious! I would definitely get it again, or maybe, if they could, just get it to-go! It was that good. Haha. It's a mixture of oreo and on top was creme brulee. Amazing. Plus, it was served with a boba straw. lol. . - The sliders were alright. I wasn't too impress. It almost had a hint of Asian flavor. It did look cute though. . - The presentation of the Hell's kitchen burgr was great. I noticed that it didn't come with lettuce and the bun had black sesame seeds on it. The hamburger meat tasted very juicy! Cooked medium. Excellent! If only it was bigger. Best burger I have eaten in a long time. . - The truffle parmesan fries were also very good. Try to eat them all there because we took it home, and tried to re-bake it to get the crisp back, but without success, it did not taste as good. But the sauces are fantastic. Dip again and again. . - Although the price was pretty steep for something typical as burger and fries, they made the experience pretty memorable. $60? That's like 5 #2 at in-n-out!!
Gordon Ramsay is known for perfection and doesn't take anything less than that and after hearing he had a restaurant in Vegas during my visit, I knew I had to try it and see his take on dining! This place instantly captures your attention boasting fire and flames shooting in a wavy pattern seen through glass with his logo name written in front of it. The place is trendy and modern with people being seated and served and food runners that seemed to be running around like clockwork. Upon watching this happen while waiting in line, I was also super hungry so I was more than ready to eat here!. . Beautiful tables, silverware, and cool square and wavy plates was what we were met with when were finally seated. The menu was foldable and wrapped around our silverware napkins. After looking at a cliche picture of mr Ramsay himself on the unfolding menu, I perused all the juicy sounding burgers and we ordered.. . We started off with the jalapeno poppers, in came with 6, and they all were served in their own square shot glass that had a white fiery sauce with a squirt of red hot sauce in them. Lets just say I wasn't prepared for these because I bit into them instantly and seconds later was asking for more water to cool my mouth down! The restaurant read my mind because before I had a chance, my glass was being refilled and refilled again, they must know this is common when people order these, I mean there place has fire everywhere and it's Hell's Kitchen, I am not surprised! The waiter also told us after that one of the poppers was secretly spicier than the others, kind of like a Russian roulette type of deal which I thought was neat and innovative and I'm pretty sure I got that one!. . Next the burgers.....oh man, nothing short of amazing. Fresh buns, perfectly melted cheese, fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked meat. Everything seemed to just melt in my mouth as it was the perfect balance of flavor. I opted for the Hell's Kitchen burger which wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. It had tomato, avocado, peppers, and cheese. My date got the arugula and goat cheese burger which I tried and it was just as delicious. I was highly pleased eating them as we munched on our garlic fries with a side of homemade ketchup and truffle mayonnaise dipping sauces on the side. The fries were great but a little heavy on the seasoning.. . Being in Vegas, these prices were very reasonable (~$12-$16 a burger) and it left us with plenty of money aside to use for gambling! This place did not disappoint at all and it was the perfect way to start off the night! Gordon Ramsay knows how a restaurant should be run and this place is a prime example!
GR BurGR perfectly fits in Vegas. The grand fire window displays the WOW factor when you enter the place. . . Ordered the Farm Burger and it was highly recommended by the waitress. I was pretty pleased with the recommendation. The burger came with a fried egg and duck bacon.   It was definitely tasty and perfectly cooked! Not too rare and well done. The truffle fries ordered was my least favorite as it was soggy and too salty. . . Overall, it was a good experience in terms of the wait staff and the atmosphere.
The hells kitchen burger was alright. The hog burger was worse. At 17 dollars, even though its on the strip, i expect my socks to be blown off. I have had way better burgers for a fraction of the price made in a food truck. Not impressed with the regular fries, sweet potato fries, or truffle fries. Sliders were decent. I would like to think a restaurant by Gordon Ramsey could beat a hole in the wall burger joint in Texas but sadly it falls way short. The two times Ive ate here the only thing thing that is in my mind is, "Ive had better".
I expect nothing less than perfect from Gordon Ramsay and BurGR definitely did not disappoint. It was so good that my husband and I had lunch at BurGR two days in a row during our short stay in Vegas. Had we been there another day, we sadly probably would have gone again!. . Even though there appears to be a long line in Planet Hollywood waiting to get a table, the line moves rather quickly. The staff are incredibly friendly, helpful, and efficient. It was also great to see managers moving around and helping wherever was needed. And if you're a fan of the show Hell's Kitchen, you'll be able to see one of the show chefs in the kitchen that is viewable from the sitting area.. . As starters, we had the jalapeno poppers. The order comes with about 6 that are presented in shot glasses with sauce. The sauce has cheddar, bacon, and ranch.. mmm... One of the poppers is supposed to be especially "hot" because the jalapeno seeds are left in; however, we like spicy and theyall tasted pretty much mild to us. Nonetheless, they were sooo good. You definitely get several bites from each popper so if you're thinking 6 isn't much for two, it was just the perfect amount. . . Besides... we ordered the truffle parmesan fries in addition to our burgers. One order of fries was just enough to share between the two of us and we sadly didn't even finish them! They were delicious but with the poppers, burgers, and drinks.. it was a lot of food! . . As for the burgers, I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger on both days. It had cheese, avocado, roasted tomatoes, and roasted jalapeno peppers. I also added duck bacon to it, which was great. My husband tried the Uber Cheese Burger that had fontina cheese, raclette cheese, and goat cheese (he added duck bacon) as well as the Blue Burger with blue cheese and arugula (with of course, duck bacon). We loved each burger and devoured them. The burgers have so much flavor and are cooked perfectly that there is really no need to add anything to them (like condiments, etc). The flavors soaked into the burger buns and made each bite so delicious. . . We look forward to visiting there again soon. Although we did not order them, we ogled over plates that came out. We kept seeing gigantic chili hot dogs come out smothered with so much good stuff that we hope to try. The shakes all looked amazing and if I hadn't been so smitten with their bar drinks, I might have tried one. Can't wait to experience BurGR again!
This place seems to always have a line... But the good news is, it moves pretty fast.  I got the chanterelle burgr Which was very flavorful... And very filling. My friend and I shared an order of the Truffled Fries... The truffle dip was VERY yummy, the house ketchup was just meh. I also got the butterscotch and banana shake... It was supergood, not too sweet, you can taste the fresh banana in it, and the butterscotch bit was actually pudding, which made the shake a bit more interesting. I liked this restaurant, but I'm not completely sure it's one I'd return to next time I'm in Vegas.
Came here after a show and waiting time was 45 mins to an hour.  Promised our son that we would eat here so we waited.  . . I do not care much for the fire decor they have going in the entrance.  Just a waste of gas and since it is spring and getting warmer, that area where they have the gas burning is uncomfortably hot.  Impractical and a waste of energy. . . I sampled the farm burger and the one with the morel mushrooms. Liked the farm burger a lot. Also enjoyed the truffle Parmesan fries and the Oreo Shake, aka Shake #4.  Those 3 items get 4 stars. . . Also tried the "honey pork belly bao" which I will never get from them again.   I make something similar and I was hoping to get a positive reference point for the pork belly baos.  Their's was a disappointment.  Uncured bacon slices smeared with the strong hoisin, and garnished with dill pickles?  It was just not good.  It tasted like an inexperienced cook put it together.
The Cesar salad was horribly drenched in dressing. The chicken in the sliders was hard and very thin. Very disappointing for a "Ramsey" establishment.
I got the farm burger ($15)- comes with egg, duck breast bacon, and cheddar. The bun was toasty and delicious, the meat was PERFECT, the egg was soft but not runny, and I've never had duck before but it was salty and way above regular bacon. I'm no culinary expert but all I can say was that it was delicious. Actually, it was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my entire life. Gordon Ramsay really knows what he's doing! The fries were legit fries- really thick cut, not oily, and so hot and fresh that we had to wait to eat them! The ketchup is really unique, I've never tried anything like it. Highly recommended if you're in Las Vegas!
I thought this place was decent. I had the farm burger which was good but I didn't think it was worth the price. They have really good Parmesan truffle fries and dipping sauces but the service was horrible. It took forever to get our food and our waitress rarely came over.
Absolutely love this place! I would highly recommend this place! My husband and I eat there every time we come to vegas! I have tried 3 different burgers from the menu and loved them all! Fries with truffle salt is enough for 3 or 4 people to share! You will not be disappointed eating here!
Meeting Babe and one of his guests here. I've never been so he ordered the Hell's Kitchen and Euro Burgers.. I started off with the Euro Burger and gave it back to Babe to finish off. It's not a bad burger but I'm not a goat cheese fan.. The Hell's Kitchen Burger was good BUT it could have DEFINITELY been spicier! . I'd definitely like to go back and sample some other menu items tho!. . And Cindy at the host stand is the sweetest!
BurGR was one of the best meals we had in vegas. If you like burgers, (and you should) you gotta stop here!. . Put your name in and they'll text your phone when your table is ready so you have time to peruse around the casino and check out the shops at Planet Hollywood. . . There were five of us and we all ordered the farm burger or the Hell's Kitchen burger and both were some of the best burgers I've ever had! We also split the jalapeno poppers  and way too many amazing truffle fries. 3 orders is way more than enough for 5 people! . . The service was  as outstanding as the atmosphere and I'll tell everyone I know going to vegas to check this place out!
I sat at the bar since I ate myself. I had the Earth Burger which was vegetarian. It came with grilled portabello mushroom, fontina cheese, arugula, and roasted tomatoes. If you love mushrooms, then this i the burger for you. There were 3-4 layers of mushroom in the burger. Otherwise, the flavors were okay. I thought it was expensive for $15 which was one of the most expensive burgers on the menu. . . I wish there were smaller portions for the sweet potato fries. I asked if they could make a half portion, but they said no. . . Service was fine for me.
I highly recommend this place, it is hands down one of the best meals I have ever had in my entire life.. . Great burgers and amazing shakes. I prefer this over even Ramsay Steak.. . Go!
The BurGR is a beautifully set out restaurant and full of lots of sharp-looking waitstaff, and despite a lengthy line for group-dining, as a single I was able to sit right down at the bar.  I ordered one of the special burger offereings, the uber cheeseburger medium well.  I think of burger-medium well as "no pink in the middle," or passably the tiniest bit of pink in the middle as ground beef should be cooked much more thoroughly than, say, a beef steak.  Many restaurants will not even have a medium-rare burger as an option owing to the chance of food poisoning from undercooked hamburgers.  When the burger arrived 25 minutes later, it looked gorgeous on its puffy roll, with the cheese nicely melted and the beef sporting a glazed, glistening look.  But the first bite into the burger crushed my enthusiasm.  If the burger was 1/2 inch thick, then the middle 1/4 inch all the way through the burger was pink.  2 days later I am comfortable stating that the burger did not make me sick, but for a guy's whose reputation is built on quality control, how he let this burger come out of his kitchen so underdone is a mystery.  I'll be curious to see what other reports come out of this restaurant.
Waited about an hour to sit down at this place and expecting something amazing. The wait even took around 30-40 minutes to get our burgers and fries as soon as we ordered.. . I got the all american burger and expected a really good cheeseburger. The meat party wasn't even juicy. The one thing they got right about the patty was that they cooked it medium well for me.. . I mean, I wouldn't come back to this place again. A lot of people probably come here just for the name. Just wasn't satisfied
This was a really good burger place I found in the Hard Rock Hotel/Casino.  Being a fan of Gordon Ramsey, this was my first time in one of his restaurants.  The atmosphere was distracting (that's Vegas baby!) but the service was top-notch.  The staff was knowledgeable and friendly.  The Fury wings and Hell's Kitchen burger was tasty.
