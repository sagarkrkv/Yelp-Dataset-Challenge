The ramen is amazing! The broth is on point (spicy tonkotsu), the noodles were cooked wonderfully, and the adds were just right for me! -add ons: corn, seaweed, soft boiled egg, tender pork slices, and a little green onion. I also had the gyoza, which I made my own concoction dipping sauce from all of the different spices from the table condiments. Yum!
Yes there IS a light at the end of the Spring Mountain Road Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant tunnel!  Tucked away in the back of a somewhat crowded strip mall (on your right hand side as you pass Decatur going up Spring Mountain) is Monta Ramen.  As with most Japanese Ramen houses, this place is tiny but I think that's what makes it feel so authentic. . . What sets Monta apart from the others I've tried is the deliciously rich pork bone soup base that you know has been simmering for hours on end.  The noodles are perfect, not too firm but not soggy and the portions are just right.  And if you're crazy enough in thinking about adding that ridiculously priced $1.50 egg, do it.  Even though it costs the same as almost a dozen at the supermarket you won't regret it because it's semi runny/creamy texture blends perfectly with the soup.  Sitting at the bar, digging into my bowl of noodle heaven made me feel like I needed to start loudly slurping to show my appreciation. . . If you're in the area Monta is definitely not to be missed...or actually don't go, it'll be a shorter wait for me.  :)
Being a huge fan of noodles I consider myself somewhat of an expert on noodles.  Finding this place by searching on Yelp I really did not expect what I found.  The food here is absolutely awesome.  I could say all of the things that everyone else uses to describe the food here but for me it wouldn't be enough.  I have taken detours from cross country driving just to come here.  To me it is worth losing a day of travel time just to enjoy their food.  Recently my Dentist informed me that he had a 3 day conference in LV so I directed him to Monta.  When he came back he told me it was so good that he ate there 6 times in 3 days which means he had lunch and dinner there for 3 days in a row.  If that isn't proof of how totally awesome Monta is then nothing is.  For me it is as good as any I have had the pleasure of enjoying though I do personally consider it the best.  I have nothing against the Ramen in Japan as that is considered the mecca of ramen but Monta seems to have come from a back alley of Tokyo and shines much brighter.  At this very moment I am craving a bowl but just cannot run to Vegas right now but I would if I could because it is that good.
First off, this ramen place is in a favorite plaza of mine known for amazing food: Trattoria Nakamura-ya, Snowflake Shavery, Zen? I have had this place on my bookmarks for a while.. . Stopped in today for a solo lunch- was seated quick as there was a spare spot open at the bar, but when I first went in there was a wait list. Yes, at 3PM on a Saturday. Plan ahead if you're going with a group!. . Service was great- two super-sweet ladies were attentive and friendly throughout my visit. Placed my order for the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen, added the egg, nori, and shredded green onion. Initially I was put off by having to add on my favorite ingredients separately, but the silver lining to doing so was that I was able to meet the $10 credit card minimum without buying a separate appetizer.. . While waiting for my bowl, I was entertained watching the guys in the kitchen making endless batches of noodles. Got my order fairly quick as the restaurant started emptying outa bit.. . My first reaction was one of happy surprise: the steep $1.50 fee for green onion got me a shredded nest of it atop my bowl, an unexpectedly gigantic amount that found itself in every bite I took. In a good way! Found the noodles to be thinner than I prefer but cooked to a perfect al dente. Shredded the nori into small pieces to distribute throughout my bites. The broth lacked the depth that I've had elsewhere, but I was pleasantly surprised to use the brown garlic oil on the table and get a robust improvement in the flavor. Potential new favorite condiment alert!. Sad to note that the chashu was somehow lost among the kicked-up broth and sea of shredded onion. What is usually a highlight of my ramen experience was just mediocre here, the cut I had was not fatty nor was it particularly flavorful either.. . I will likely be back because service was great and there are other varieties to try on the menu, but I was slightly underwhelmed by the bowl I got today. Location is everything though, and this noodle house is conveniently located and will likely result in repeat visits.
This place is awesome for fresh Japanese noodles.  The spicy tonkotsu is excellent.  Don't forget the kimchi fried rice.  Everything on the menu is excellent.
love this plaza! in this plaza there's foot massage, japanese curry, fluffy snow ice AND ramen!! it's basically your one stop shop to heaven! the ramen here is super flavorful and you can ask for thick or thin noodles. I also love the soft boiled egg. yummy. the fried rice and gyoza is good too! . . Go during off meal times to avoid waits!
The wife and I love it... the kids love it... great food! The place is extremely small for a really popular place. Expect to wait for a table for at least 15 to 20 mins. It's that popular. It's very worth it though. As a family, we have gone many times
Terrific spicy tonkotsu soup and the pork bellies wil  awesome defienetly going back for another more
So far the best ramen i had in Vegas. The fried rice is pretty good, it's a small portion tho.
I had the shoyu ramen with egg. I didnt like the egg since it wasnt well done. But the soup was great especially on a cold day.. . The pork belly bowl was delicious and the gyoza. . . I gave it a 4 star cos of the place its too small and crowded. I feel crammed in the restaurant.
I thought the fried rice and fried rice special dishes were awesome!  But, the soup was a little too salty.  :(   . . A friend of mine who is Asian said that some of the places do not mean for you to drink the broth, that it is for flavoring the meat and other stuff in the soup.  I really don't understand that.. . The seating was pretty tight and some of the people sat around texting for a long time while we were waiting.  Maybe they should have some kind of alarm/timer to get people to get up and get a move-on!!  Other people are hungry..... . But, overall it was good.  Might try a few other places though....
This place was very busy at 4:00pm.  We ordered the miso ramen and fried rice.  Both were ok but, nothing special.   Prices were reasonable.
Very good place to go after partying all night... The ramen fills the stomach and helps the burn of alcohol. I like how they kept the place small so it had an authentic Japanese ramen house feel. Food is inexpensive and the wait is not as bad as other ramen places I have visited. The meat just melts in your mouth and has a very soft texture. You can order the noodles hard if you want to help with the hangover from raging all night.  The style of the ramen is very similar to the ones I had in Fukuoka japan.  A must visit especially if you are hungover from the night before.
love their soup noodle, the soup taste so good. Price is very good. But bad customer service + long waiting time.
My favorite type of place by concept. When the wait is SO worth it. But we waited 2 hours to find that they had called our name 30 min after we had listed ourselves... it didn't matter, we just wanted what we came for-- ramen.. . By the time we sat, our large intestine had eaten our small intestines (or so it felt) so we had to order something to tide us over while waiting for ramen, and the fried rice and pork belly bowl were absolutely delicious and did the trick. . . I ordered the special black garlic tonkatsu ramen and bear had the regular. The noodles were perfect, the bowl came out immaculate. I did learn that as much as I LOVE animal fat, I am not a tonkatsu broth fan. There was too much black garlic oil in my bowl as it over-encompassed every bite, and I feel like it should have been more of a nuance... so I could barely eat half the bowl. . . But I could see the quality and consistency (otherwise) in their food. Service was prompt and friendly. Wish I was closer to give it another 5 shots, I'd wait 2 hours again.
A friend and I stopped by around 1:30 on a Saturday. We were about 5th down the waiting list but did not wait very long. The service was quick and efficient. We ordered the Miso Ramen and the Shoyu ramen. They were both delicious. The noodles were perfectly cooked. We ordered the flavored egg in our ramen and they were AMAZING. The egg white was amazingly tender while the yolk was perfectly runny and flavorful. The broth was a tad salty if you're just drinking it when you're done with the noodles. But other than that, it was a wonderful experience.
This small crowded place makes the awesome ramen in the area. If you sick of the buffets and over priced restaurants in the strip. Then have a nice bowl of noddles where you dont see slot machines.
This place is absolutely wonderful! The restaurant may not be very spacious, but the food is great. The food is also very cheap, considering the food proportion they give out. Overall, I recommend this place for its authentic, inexpensive, and great quality foods.
the best taste.
Love this place three time here!!
Some of the best broth I've ever tasted. Slightly salty but worth it with The draft Beer and the mustard green fried rice is out o this world. Deep flavor and addicting to say the least. And in the Summer months the cold noodles with ponzu sauce is worth the trip alone!
First time eating Japanese food and is was great:) My friend from Japan came with me and my boyfriend. We loved it and will start being regulars:) The place only seats about  25-30 people if that:( It is defiantly my diamond in the ruff!!
Ramen is good. Pork Belly bowl is best! If ur rolling ten deep go mid afternoon - only way u'll get in! Broth rocks -  Tonkatsu shoyu is my fave. Spicy Tonkatsu is decent.  I suggest switching to the thicker noodles - much better in my view.  The fried rice and gyoza is notable as well. This review is a lil' late as I hadn't realized it was still in my draft pile.  Monta is amazing - I'll def be back the next time I'm in Vegas!
The food here is good, but I was surprisingly more satisfied with the kimchi fried rice than the ramen! The kimchi fried rice was so good that we ordered some to-go to eat as a snack. The ramen: noodles were good, chashu was good, broth was average. Gyoza was also a nice starter to share.. . Don't come with a lot of people.... unless you are willing to wait... almost 2 hours....
Ok, before I start my actual review, PLEASE READ: when you go to this restaurant, it is not a "sit and chat" type place. It is a traditional Japanese ramen shop where you eat your ramen fast and leave. Not trying to sound rude or pushy, but please respect this Japanese tradition. Plus, the line gets really long really fast, especially at noon.. . The spicy Tonkotsu Ramen is my favorite. It's always listed as a special. I get that with corn added in. I LOVE IT. . . The kimchi rice is my second favorite. My parents love the cold noodles too. It's just such a unique menu despite being so short. But hey, studies show that with fewer choices, you're usually happier. . . If you aren't full after one bowl, you can ask for a refill of noodles for (I believe it's $2). But they won't give you extra broth for that cost, so save enough broth if you know you'll need another serving.
If you are a ramen fan, this is the place to be! Incredible taste all around with their whole entire menu selection!!! . . Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen -the soup was perfectly seasoned and the noodles were done in perfection. Highly recommended to order with additional sides (egg and seaweed) to complete the flavor. Also I was able to ask the waitress to take out the bamboo shoots as I don't like the taste and it's used as soup filler. . . This is a small place and it gets packed quick. It you want to come eat at this place, you should be prepared to wait in line or go early before the rush hour.
ramen is good,but my favorite is pork belly bowlthey are very deliciousmy friend and i was really like it
I really like their noodles! If you don't like salt, you can ask less salt. Their is a long waiting line here. Everybody likes this Japanese noodle house:)
The best ramen I had had - hands down. Small place and they pack them in. I choose this over Pho more times than not.
tight space but it adds character to place. . . simple menu but it higlhly pleases my taste buds!. . always have to visit this place when in vegas... cannot even find one in socal that can top this place off .
Hands down the best ramen in town! I go here at least once a week to get my ramen fix. And the prices can't be beat. One Sapporo and a bowl of ramen is always less than $15 (not including a well deserved tip). Fast and friendly service every time
Just tried Monta Ramen for the first time at the Ramen Yokocho Festival in Los Angeles.  As a SoCal native, I was blown away by how good Monta's product was.  They were easily the best bowl of ramen at the festival.. . They took on Tsujita, Zagat rated and the best LA has to offer, and stood toe to toe.  I work in the Westside, so I eat at Tsujita a couple of times a month.  Monta gave them a run for their money with fine, al dente noodles, half a perfectly cooked onsen tamago, and an unctuous broth that was rich and flavorful without being too heavy.. . Monta easily beat the two heavy hitters from Japan - Mattou Seimen, three time Tokyo Ramen Festival champion, and Tatsu No Ya, the #1 ramen shop in Kyushu.. . Monta also took out a personal favorite, Shalala Ramen from my native NorCal, and a Googler staple.  (Shalala's Mountain View shop is 5 minutes from the Googleplex.). . Shinsengumi Hakata Ramen?  Not even a contender.. . Monta Ramen is now on my short list of must-eat places in Las Vegas, along with Japanese Curry Zen.
Craving for some Ramen! Monta is the spot to go to. This place definitely satisfies your Ramen craving. There was a long wait since this place is very small and their was 8 of us. It was worth the wait!. . I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. It was mighty delicious! I also ordered a side of the dumplings, which a must try. You can tell they make it fresh, it's not your typical frozen prepackaged ones.
