We have frequented the Flamingo numerous times. We love that it's on a monorail stop, and the rooms are super nice. Even their "basic" rooms are nice and updated. Very comfy beds and I love the decor. What I don't like, the food selection sucks. There are not any good restaurants and the buffet is gross. Every time we stay there, we sleep there and eat elsewhere. Trust me, we aren't that picky but the food is not edible. We were there last winter. It was about 50 degrees out. Keep in mind, I'm from Nebraska. I can handle the cold. I don't mind the cold. But I need adequate blankets. The beds do not have blankets. They have a top sheet. we called housekeeping and a nice lady who did not speak English came to our room. We asked her for a blanket.....3 times. She cocked her head and tried to repeat "blanket" but bless her heart she couldn't. Finally we gave up and told her nevermind, but thank you. We couldn't figure out how to say blanket in Spanish so we gave up and froze. She was a nice lady but blanket was not in her vocab. Also, get a damn Starbucks. I don't want to walk over to Harrah's for a coffee. Join the rest of the strip and drink the Starbuck's koolaid. We will definitely stay there again. Once they get blankets in the winter and a Starbucks.
For the sole purpose of having a place to sleep, shower and keep your stuff dry, . Flamingo is more than fine. I wouldn't take my wife here or let my parents stay . here but I went to Vegas for a bachelor party and crashed in a Fab Deluxe room . for three days without incident. . . The hotel is most definitely worn down. From the room furniture to the bathroom . fixtures to the elevators, it ain't classy. But it's safe enough and the price . is usually right. Location is outstanding; I could get on the strip in minutes . thanks to my room being right off of the Habitat Elevators (that north exit into the . Linq is sweet!). . . Stay at Flamingo for the convenience, price and nothing else.
We booked three rooms in advance and it was suppose to be there updated rooms and all right next to each other. When we got there they changed it on us we had the rooms on the same floor not next to each other which was fine however they were suppose to be king size beds they gave us the rooms with two queens beds, however we did still got the strip view..... . . The bathrooms were terrible there is no light in the shower it is like taking a shower in the dark and if you wanted to take a hot shower at night forget it you had to wait at least 15 minutes for hot water. The rooms were always cold the heater did not work it was just blowing cold air from the vents..... Not to mention that you would hear the running pipes like a screeching sound through out the night. This was my first time staying at the Flamingo and my last. All I have to say is Terrible.... I can't believe it is part of the Caesar sets of hotels.
I debated between three and four stars for the hotel but I just can't quite bring myself to give them the full four stars. Let's call it 3.5 stars instead.. . My boyfriend and I booked a room at the Flamingo for a weekend in Vegas. Our friends were staying down the street at the Paris but the Flamingo ended up being $50-$60 a night cheaper so we went with it. When you're in Vegas, you don't spend much more time in your room than to sleep and shower anyway and location is the most important element. The Flamingo has an awesome central location on the Strip and most of the major casinos (Bellagio, Paris, Caesar's, Mirage, T.I., Planet Hollywood, etc.) are a fifteen minute or less walk away. . . Check-in was quick and easy on a Friday night around 8 p.m. There's even a shorter line for Total Rewards members, which is a free player's card that is good at several of the hotels/casinos on the Strip. Although both lines were short at check-in, it's nice to know that this option exists.. . The biggest headache was trying to find a parking spot. We drove around the labyrinth of parking garage several times before we happened to see a car backing up. It was amazing how few parking spots they have available for hotel guests. It seemed like most of the garage was reserved for valet or another hotel. . . As for the room itself, we got a standard room with one king size bed. You can tell that the rooms have been upgraded and they look nice with the new fake hardwood floors (always a plus compared to carpet in a hotel room). The pink throw on the bed might look funny in another hotel but it fits the flamingo theme and my boyfriend even commented that they skinned a flamingo for us. :). . But if you look closely, you can see that not everything has been upgraded. The doors looked cheap and some of the walls could use a bit of touching up. The countertop of the bathroom looked nice but the cabinetry looked incredibly dated and the bathtub/shower combo is definitely not new. Everything seemed clean though.. . We had trouble with the TV remote and not all the buttons seemed to work. I could only scroll through the channels in one direction, for instance. Speaking of the channels, there really could be a better selection. There was nothing interesting to watch. I need my HGTV!. . One other complaint, the walls seem to be very thin and I woke up on Saturday morning to a very loud conversation in Spanish happening in the hallway. Considering the length of the convo, I'd assume it was the maids gossiping and not fellow travelers passing down the hall. . . All in all, I'd consider staying here again for the right price. But I've had nicer rooms on the Strip in the past.
I've stayed here twice, and am now contemplating another stay in October. . . My first stay I was super impressed. We had a Go Room, and I loved the look and comfort of the room. I didn't find the room dirty at all. Loved the room service chicken tenders after a long night on the strip. . . Because I had such a good experience I decided to stay here again. This time we stayed in a Fab Deluxe room. It wasn't bad by any means. But it didn't have the clean and comfortable feel as the Go Rooms. It was also kind of a trek to get too which was kind of annoying. However upon my second stay I had less then stellar service. I was locked out of my room for most of the stay. The batteries on the lock were dying and I would constantly have to get replacement keys. Literally 3 a day over a 5 day period!!! I left my wallet by accident on the way to a family birthday dinner and couldn't get back into the room because of course my keys wouldn't work. I ended up having to skip dinner. The employees at the desk were in no way helpful. The one guy told me it was obviously my fault and that I kept "deactivating" keys and was so unapologetic. Security on the last day finally checked the lock told me it was dying. It was literally the worst experience I ever had on vacation! I called the hotel multiple times to get some kind of reaction and nothing. . . This is the main reason alone I'm debating returning. Why would you wanna treat your customers that way? I paid for a room I could barely get in. So we shall see. . . Pros:. Great location.. Good price.. Good food options that aren't overly priced. . Room service is excellent. . Not overly packed. . . Cons:. Elevators are very worn down and dingy looking. . Bad customer service.
You have to judge Flamingo for what it is. Flamingo isn't trying to be Caesars or Bellagio, Flamingo is a lower option to a number of hotels on the strip but it's a bit cheaper and has a superb location. . . The good: The Flamingo is one of the few reasonably priced hotels on the strip and that counts for a lot when the casinos are going to be taking your money anyway. The rooms are actually fairly nice as they were recently remodeled. They're a bit pink I admit to stick with the Flamingo theme, but the bathrooms are especially good. There's a tv in the bathroom and the showers have jets coming out of the wall. Top notch stuff. They offer digital check in, you can swipe your credit card at a kiosk and avoid dealing with lines or receptionists.. . The bad: It's clearly not as nice as some of the surrounding hotels. The casino is pretty bad, it's old, smells awful, has nowhere near enough blackjack, and is actually fairly small. And it's attached to Margaritaville which is crazy expensive and full of terrible slots. The line to check in is the slowest moving line in vegas. There are plenty of computers for receptionists, but never enough receptionists. We were working late one night and got to the hotel after midnight only to find they had cancelled our reservations, so I got stuck in some terrible room after much complaining because they'd just given away the room.. . Overall: Flamingo's cheaper than most hotels on the strip, just don't expect much.
I wish I could post black holes instead of stars! I really wish I could post this with 0 stars.. . When we checked out they tried to charge additional fees because we were there on a holiday. I was already paying holiday rates! The supervisor became snippy and turned her computer screen towards me so I could read the fine print. At this point 5 employees before her had the opportunity to tell me about the "fine print" including the person who booked our room. No one had uttered a word about increased package fees until that moment. Really Flamingo? You are so desperate that you have to rip off your customers? Along comes the manager who eventually credits my account the overcharge. She acknowledges that the property is aware of the room problems BUT OFFERS NO APOLOGY for the issues.. . Stay away from this place!!!! And Harrah's in general!!!!!!!!!!!
First time stay review of Flamingo Fab room 7101. First, the new FAB rooms aren't new and they're not old, they are partially remodeled. Floor (all wood except bathroom), wall coverings, shower liner, bed (Pillows and Linens), TV (SMALL), and ottoman lounger thing all new. Bathroom (toilet, vanity, mirror) and dresser old. . . Check-in/out was easy and pain free. Elevator entrance location now very convenient as they put in a new entrance to the Linq/Quad. The room was large! And bed very comfortable. Our view was of the courtyard. For $26/per night this was an absolute fantastic deal. I have no complaints, well worth the price. I would definitely consider staying here again as the value to comfort ratio is substantial.. . Note, Flamingo has a taxable $18 / night resort fee
My review is for their buffet! It was HORRIBLE!!!!!! The food was bland and stale and the drinks we're flat. The orange chicken was spoiled we told the waitress she went got the cook he had the nerve to say it wasn't spoiled it was ginger we was tasting! WTF? We all got up and left. We paid $54 at Harrah's to do the 24 hour buffet and wanted to try all the buffets thats included in the deal. Never again will I eat there. And it wouldn't hurt for them to redecorate the place!
Perhaps the best deal on the strip for a room.  If you want a room in the middle of the strip and not want to pay high prices...but don't want to stay in a dump *cough* the Quad *cough*, then stay at the Flamingo.. . Rooms are clean...not many bells and whistles.  Rooms are cheap...not the greatest casino and the casino kinda smells like the inside of your Grandmother's purse (mixture of makeup powder and ribbon candy).  Speaking of makeup...there is this one place that sells makeup there and the employees are extremely pushy.  One grabbed my fiance and attempted to sell her over $500 dollars worth of product.  He said his "wife loves it."  The dude was speaking with hand motions and a high pitch voice.  You have no wife Carlos!  So is my fiance supposed to trust you about the makeup you are trying to sell her?  . . The flamingos are neat to look at.  Did you know they are pink because of the stuff they eat?  Imagine if people were like that.  Half the country would be the color of a Big Mac.. . Stay here and save money.  Clean, decent, in the middle of everything, and cheap.
Stayed at the Flamingo for one night (2/7) after seeing a Britney Spears concert. I'm a local, but figured we might as well stay down on the Stripto enjoy the night! Upgraded to the newly renovated rooms and was excited! . . When we arrived in our room, there was trash in the trashcans, wet towels on the floor of the bathroom, beds were halfway made (end of bed runners just crumpled on the floor), and there were things strewn about that looked like they were left from a previous guest. We called down to the front desk who transferred me to a rude housekeeper who said someone would be up to finish cleaning the room. We were on our way out to dinner and the show anyway, so we said that was fine.. . Flash forward to midnight when we returned to the room. Nothing had been touched. In 8 hours. Once again, I called downstairs only to be transferred around to 4 different people and ultimately disconnected. I called once more and asked (still being very nice) to speak with a manager. After being transferred again to someone in housekeeping and letting her know that I wanted to speak to a front desk manager, one was connected to me. He said someone would be up right away to fully clean our room. By this point, it was 12:30am and we did not want housecleaners spending an hour in the room. I asked for just towels, blankets, and some form of compensation. The manager told me all he could offer was a late check out. Really? I slept in a dirty room and am checking out tomorrow morning to go home (7 miles away)...I don't want to stay longer than necessary. I asked if he could comp the resort fee...big NO to that. My fiance is a manager at one of the MGM properties, so I know that the resort fees is one of the absolute easiest things to knock off for guest disputes. But no. He offered $25 food and beverage credit. I told him that between that point and 8am (when we were leaving), we wouldn't be eating. He confirmed that the credit could only be used while we were still checked in on this stay. His resolution was to give me $50 food and beverage credit instead and say nothing else could be done. Click. . . 20 minutes later, a housekeeper gave us 3 towels, no blankets, and a ton of shampoo (???). Then we proceeded to order $30 of room service that did not get eaten just because we felt we needed to attempt to use the F&B credit. The whole plates were still in the room when we left in the morning. . . Overall, horrible customer service experience. The "renovated" rooms may look nice at first glance, but it is obvious they were done in a hurry. The paint is peeling, furniture was not replaced, bathrooms are still horrible, etc. Also, the hallways are dim and there was plastic wrap and caution tape all over the place. . . I completely agree that you get what you pay for... but for $140 (still very reasonable for a Friday night on the Strip), I'd expect a sliiiightly better time than this. DON'T STAY HERE. Or any Caesar's property really. I've also had bad experiences at others. Stay at an MGM or Steve Wynn owned establishment...or my fave, the Cosmopolitan.
This hotel was ok. It was good value for being in Vegas especially located in the middle of the strip.  The room was not too good.  The beds didn't even come with comforters and at the end of the bed was a rug like thing that was pink.  The bathroom was alright the shower had a little rust in it and there was a soap under the sink and the maids never picked it up while I was there which was disgusting.  The casino part of the hotel was pretty good when you have a low budget where table games start at 5 dollars and blackjack is 10.  You will get some good benefits if you have a platinum total rewards card or higher which can jump the buffet line or get discounts off of the hotel store. Overall this hotel is below average. I probably won't be staying here next time.
The service is all around Slow. There is major construction going on and the is no easy way to the Strip. Also all the pools and hot tubs are closed because of construction, except 1 pool and it is jam packed with people laying in walkways and on steps. Management doesnt care and says "the web site warned us". My point is; stay away till at least memorial weekend. It is supposed to be done by then.
This is for the PRICE MATCH policy they have, I was ordering the room for June 2014 and realize after placing the reservation I was redirected to a price match guarantee which later on about 2 hours later found a cheaper hotel price for exact same thing for $20 cheaper for a weekend but yes it sounds like a little but they said they will price match plus discount 10% after submitting the file they decline and said they are the same price but I check multiple times on hotels.com so if it's cheaper you must honor it and booking from a offset should save them money but nope. They told me I didn't provide enough proof.. How much can I give you other then a snap shot and the form.. Very bad service from service department dealing with price match they gave me a rough time so I just canceled and book at hotels.com for $20 cheaper so hopefully flamingo loses money and have to pay a cut to other sites. Go book at hotels.com it's better trust me
Location, location, location.  This has become my group of friends and I preferred hotel for a number of reasons. One you can't beat the location at the corner of The Strip and Flamingo road you are smackdown in the middle of the strip. Plus with the Linq opening up close by it makes the location even better. As far as bang for the buck the hotel offers a lot of value especially if your like my friends and I and all you use your room for is a to $hit, shower,  shave, and sleep because your too busy having fun to watch t.v. in your room. The pool at the flamingo is really nice and they have a party pool and a family pool so you dont have to worry about a bunch of kids running around and taking up valuable lounge chair space. And finally my friends and I really like the vibe of the poker room and they have a bar next to the poker room so drink service is usually very quick.. . Now if I was going for a weekend with a pretty lady I probably would choose a more luxurious hotel with better rooms, but as a boys or girls weekend place for the money I dont think you can do any better than Flamingo Las Vegas.
This hotel has 2 parts, the Fab rooms (old) and the Go rooms (less old) I didn't see the go rooms, but the Fab rooms are the ones I saw, they are at a moderate price. (About $175). Now for that price plus a surprise $20 hotel fee per night and $28 to check in early, you'd expect a nice room. Nicer at least. And they say it has been "remodeled"...eh, not enough. The staff were all very nice... too bad they don't have a better place to work. . . This hotel was dirty and run down, I can't believe anyone would stay there unless they were already drunk. The elevators were broken, disgustingly dirty, missing buttons on the panel and floors were sticky. Get off to find gross hallway carpet smelling of booze and pot. The room had no amenities other than a TV. Pieces of the furniture were broken, laminate torn and flapping off the one dresser, and water drips from the tub faucet. At least they thought to remove the in room carpet and replace it with (ugly) laminate floors. The bed was okay, but it had a skanky (no other word for it), pink shag throw on it that you just didn't want to touch. The bathroom was clean (yay) with poor water temperature in the shower. The walls are so thin you can hear your neighbors talking. Definitely a place to stay if you are 25 going to a bachelor party. Not the place to stay otherwise.
My first night at the Flamingo, I won a nice jackpot and decided to call it a night. When I got up to the room I discovered the TV didn't work. I tried to call the front desk- and the phone didn't work!! The bedside clock didn't work, either. The bathroom hadn't been updated at all and (surprise!) the fan didn't work. As a result, the paint on the cabinets was bubbled and peeling and the faceplate on the fan was rusty. Overall- the bathroom seemed pretty grubby. . Don't gamble on the Flamingo- it's not a winner.
We have stated at flamingo twice now. The first time, we felt we got our money's worth, we paid $40/night and it was okay. The second time, we were extremely disappointed! We just came back from spring break where they only had the family pool open! They squeezed hundreds of people into a pool meant for only about 100 people. We were all sitting on the cement, in stair cases, wherever we could find a spit for our butts. On SPRING BREAK! They had their huge 21 and over pool closed on spring break!! Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed as we came to Vegas on spring break for some pool time parties. There were no signs to let us know that either, no pre-warning of any kind. Second, this is a hotel who 2 years ago said charging resort fees was wrong. Guess who charges resort fees now?! And not only that, but they charged me $129 security deposit to make sure my $60 resort fees went through okay. What?! Third, there were countless things wrong in our room including huge holes in doors. We definitely will not be back. Stay at Mlife resorts in Vegas.
I've stayed at the Flamingo twice too many times and I don't see myself staying here again (unless otherwise).. . Both times I've stayed in the Fab Deluxe room and there's nothing really 'Fab' about it. Sure it's remodeled but it's just a basic room with two comfortable beds (I stayed in the Queen room both times), fake hardwood floors and a flat screen. The bathroom was NOT remodeled and looked like it's seen better days.. . Both times I've stayed here, my keys stopped working....ummm that's not ok. Especially when I had to go downstairs and wait in a long line just to get a new one ughhhh.. . The second time I've stayed here, we had some toilet issues and after about 2 hours someone finally looked at it (I could've fixed the toilet myself instead of waiting that long for a maintenance worker ha!) I was even offered a $30 credit for the 'inconvenience' but I ended up not using it (oh well).. . Once thing I did like about this hotel is, I didn't have to wait in a line to check in. I checked in & out at one of the kiosks by the front desks. Now that was very convenient!. . Another plus is the location! Right in the heart of the strip! I can't complain about that!. . All in all if you are looking for a hotel in the heart of the strip & a room to take your naps, then the Flamingo is the place for you!
Thanks Ruth for the great customer service you provided!!! Executive suite had an amazing view!!!!
A few modifications and this hotel could be great.  Unfortunately, the recent renovations fell short for a few reasons.  . . 1. The Habitat elevators were disgustingly filthy.  The rest of the casino felt fairly clean, but please, someone, polish the brass regularly and wipe down the buttons!. . 2. New vinyl floor in the rooms = tons more noise from room to room.  We literally were able to conduct conversations with the girls next door, and we didn't know them.  We had adjoining rooms, but the doors were closed, and there was a 1" gap between the floor and the bottom of the door.  Either put plush carpeting back in, or add weather sripping to muffle some of the noise.  This was awful.. . 3. No coffee machine in the room?  When was the last time you stayed in a hotel without a coffee maker?  $240/night should include basic necessities if you ask me. Coffee, fridge (also not included).. . 4. The blankets were inadequate.  They delivered more when we called for them, but again, I point to the room price - this should not be an add-on.. . 5. Terrible shower head and mold in the bathroom.. . 6. Hall carpet needs to be replaced.  It was stained beyond repair, but worse, buckled in places, causing trip hazards.. . The good: the casino air quality was great.  I didn't leave feeling like I'd smoked a pack of cigarettes.  The Go Pool was lovely.  The beds were extremely comfortable.. . For the price, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.
Time for an update since my original review is nearly two years old. I've stayed here a number of times since then, and while I can't give it a full bump-up to four stars, I can say it's definitely improved (if I could give it 3 1/2 stars, I would).. . The pros: With the addition of The Linq and the reworking of the surrounding area, the location of Flamingo went from very good to great. It's become easier than ever to make your way north up the Strip to The Quad, Harrah's, and points north (in fact, the Habitat Tower elevators are just down the hall from the exit to The Linq, which is insanely convenient). Meanwhile, the monorail station out back is very useful if you're looking to travel further north or south without all the foot traffic. Also, points for affordable gambling (there's usually a pretty wide assortment of $10 blackjack) and lodging (after taxes and resort fees, I paid $520 and change for five nights).. . The cons: They mostly lie in the age of the property. Some of the rooms (namely in the Habitat Tower) could use slight upgrades, namely in bathrooms. I'm pretty tall and almost hit my head in the shower. Also, the buffet, which used to be one of the best in Las Vegas, has gotten much worse. We went for breakfast one day, and one could count the number of pieces of fresh fruit being served on one hand. Finally, the sports book is unremarkable and very smoky. We spent most of Sunday afternoon there watching the NCAA basketball tournament, and the set of clothes I wore that day smelled like cheap cigar smoke for the rest of the trip. Also, while the tellers taking bets were personable and did a great job, drink service to the sports book was VERY slow (I made the remark that they must be running the rum in from the Dominican; it sure seemed that way!).. . Conclusion: The Flamingo is a fun, cheap, and convenient place to stay. You could do better if you're willing to spend more money, but it's a good bargain, you can't beat the location, and the casino is decent enough. However, steer clear of the buffet, and if you pop into the sports book to place bets, make sure it's a short visit.
My friends and I stayed at Flamingo hotel at their Fab Deluxe Double Queen room. It was a good deal, two nights coming out to about $250 for 2 queen beds. My two friends had stayed at Flamingo hotel before and recommended it because it was a good deal for how much you pay. I was skeptical at first, because Flamingo has been around for a while (compared to the other hotels on the strip), but I decided to give it a try, and with two couples, $250 was a steal! . . While reading the website, it stated that the room was newly remodeled. My friend was telling me how their bathrooms were really nice and had a tv inside. When we arrived, all we saw that was remodeled was the floor. The beds and bathroom felt like I was staying at a motel! It turns out she was talking about the Go Deluxe! We were coming from LA after work, so we were too tired to ask the front desk if we could switch rooms and we decided to stay at the Fab Deluxe Double Queen. . . Their bed was mediocre. Their blanket was hardly a blanket. It was a flat sheet with a  cheaper feeling fleece blanket. I think the blankets also made me a little itchy =[ . . The bathroom was really small! The last time I had a bathroom that small was when I went snowboarding in Mammoth and we stayed at a motel! The shower was very strong and was hurting my back =[. . For what we paid, it definitely was what we got. I probably would not come back to this particular room. I would definitely book the Go Deluxe next time to see the upgrades. In terms of a Vegas room, it is definitely what I would anticipate if I was heading to Vegas. So many other hotels with great quality but you definitely would have to pay more for the rooms. . . For this price, I would rather take my money to MGM. Flamingo made MGM feel like a 5 star resort when I usually think of MGM as one of the lower quality hotels compared to Venetian, Cosmopolitan and Aria.
Pretty nice hotel. Use the kiosks to check in for sure. Service was actually really friendly here. Some parts of the hotel are kind of ghetto but even in that part the rooms were nice. We also had a great view. Location is great and price was too.
Not very nice... I've been in nicer Motel 6's.. . Arrived to the hotel at 12:30, the line to check-in took about an hour and half. The room (Fab Deluxe, double queen) was dirty, and the water pressure in the shower was not great. Saw cockroaches crawling up the walls in the hallways and the elevator was sticky and buttons were missing. My key deactivated several times and I was unable to get in the room The Flamingo really smells like cigarettes, more so than other hotel/casinos I visited. NO WIFI: costs 20 dollars per night.. . Pros: great location, right in the middle of the strip. The flamingo habitat is beautiful and the GO pool looked amazing although I didn't go. Exits to the Linq, a great mini strip with retail stores and restaurants. Tip: go to the starbucks right outside for free wifi. . . Went to Vegas for a conference so the room was paid for, but I understand that the Flamingo is one of the less expensive Vegas hotels. You get what you pay for, I guess. If you're going to Vegas for fun and won't be spending too much time in the room, it's just OK.
Was there over the weekend for a work event. We had a block of rooms and no issues at all checking in since it's right in the middle of March madness. We were given a conference room suite that very suitable for our large group. The entire flamingo family was great and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. Out point of contact was  Kim Reiss, Catering Convention Service Manager. He's was very attentive and on top of any concerns we had and was available any time. The flamingo is a great place to stay, the location is great and it's puts u within walking distance of almost anything.
Although I usually stay at Caesars or Paris, I often stay here instead because they have the best corned beef hash. Excellent for countering hangovers. Wake up naked, call room service and order corned beef hash and smoke a joint while waiting. Hangover will be cured in no time.
Flamingo is old time Vegas, but the location and the price are why I stay there.you can not expect 5star when paying 2star price. The room had been renovated,flat screen,big comfortable bed,decent shower etc.. I have no complaints,the staff were all friendly,room was clean and you are right on the center of the strip.. I did join the total rewards program before arrival which did bypass the check in line.The money I saved on the hotel went towards Pen and Teller show,excellent.
I think that the overall score of 3 stars is accurate for the Flamingo. Having been to Las Vegas several times and staying at a variety of hotels, our stay there was definitely 3 plus stars, but can't make it 4. While they have renovated the rooms, the bathrooms still date back more than a decade.. . The service was great and the casino is ideally located around the intersection of Flamingo road. When we first arrived the construction all around was a real drag and complicated our access to the hotel, but over our stay we made it work. My main reason for choosing Flamingo was the price due to it being a last minute trip and a busy March Madness weekend in Vegas. . . Overall, I would stay there again if the price is right, but there are better properties in the area for a marginally higher rate.
While the hotel was fabulous (love the pink everywhere!), the customer service was horrendous! Specifically, the check in/out process was the worst I've ever experienced! The front desk attendant provided us with wrong information at check-in and was complete incompetent. He could not accurately explain charges to our credit cards and made the process messy and confusing. Upon check out, our front desk attendant noted we were double charged resort fees! This was an "easy fix" at check in, but had been overlooked because the front desk attendant was awful. . . Another unfortunate situation we experienced dealt with cleanliness. The room service a guest across the hall ordered was not removed for over 24 hours. I literally had to call down to guest services and ask them to pick it up because the ranch dressing had spilled everywhere. It was disgusting. . . Needless to say, we enjoyed our room and pool at the Flamingo, but will never stay there again because of the terrible customer service.
