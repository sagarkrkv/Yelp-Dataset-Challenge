We walked by on our way to the Giants baseball game on Friday and it looked good, so we went for lunch today in the rain.  It was just wonderful. We sat on the back patio which was not crowded, even though it was pretty crowded inside.  Our waiter was pleasant, prompt, and helpful in explaining menu items.  I had the shrimp tacos and my husband had Huevos Rancheros.  We also ordered a side of the street corn.  It was one of the best meals we've had on this trip.  The rain added to the already lovely ambience.  . . The tacos, in addition to tasting wonderful, looked just as good.  The presentation is clearly important to them.  The service was equally good. . . A great place for either lunch or dinner.
We happened past The Mission as we were wandering around Old Town Scottsdale before today's Giants game (Giants won! Yes!). As we're vegetarians, and ballpark food is usually pretty sparse for folks who don't eat hot dogs and cheese steaks, we were looking for a place to grab some lunch before the game, and the menu here drew us right in.. . We chose to sit on the well-shaded patio, as the interior of the restaurant is rather dark. The patio is really pleasant...well-shaded, and with plenty of cover to prevent...er...birdy accidents (I normally avoid dining al fresco, having lost many a tasty meal to a sparrow's incontinence, but this patio was sheltered enough that it seemed -- and, thankfully, was -- safe!).. . Neither of us wanted anything heavy (we were still a bit full from a wonderful pizza at Papago Brewing the night before, and anticipating a big dinner at Cafe Lalibela in Tempe that evening). I ordered the Grilled Romaine Salad and an order of Grilled Street Corn, and my husband had the Roasted Organic Butternut Squash Tacos. We regretfully declined the tableside quacamole, even though we're major guac fans, as we knew we'd never find room for it (we did see it being made, though, and it looked amazing).. . We both enjoyed our food, but we also agreed that my meal was the real star. If you've never tried (or thought about) grilling lettuce, you're really missing something! Grilling brings out the sweetness in this often rather bland vegetable, and adds a nice smokiness that was, in this salad, perfectly complemented by the chipotle vinaigrette. Everything was in perfect balance, with a slight saltiness added by the cotija cheese, a kiss of heat from the chipotles, and textural contrasts provided by the black beans and the thin tortilla strips. It was generously sized too...perfect for a light lunch.. . The corn was, in a word, amazing. My serving consisted of nearly an entire ear of corn, served as two skewers, each bathed in a luscious chili-laced butter sauce and lightly coated with more cotija cheese. Yum!. . My husband's tacos were very good as well. They were served as three mini-tacos, each on a small, handmade tortilla. The proportion of filling to tortilla made them something you'd want to eat with a fork (like a small, not-fried, tostada) rather than try to pick up. The filling was well-seasoned and had a very good flavor.. . I also had one of their house margaritas (on the rocks), and it was very well-made. You knew you were drinking tequila and not some cheap-o candy drink. Good flavor, with just the right amount of tartness.. . Very glad we stopped here! We'll be repeat customers!
Very good food and ambiance! Order guacamole...Only downside is the table booths are very close to each other. Make reservations.
My wife and I came here on Tuesday.  Early dinner, but had our reservations for 2 weeks. Wesat inside. I saw several reviews about it being "romantic" but I would caution that the noise level goes extremely high. . . The cocktails and sipping tequila were a fun touch.  A tequila mojito?  Not bad. We started with table side guacamole.  My wife ordered a duck confit, and I had a chorizo pork shoulder. Both were good, but we both felt stuffed before we could finish the entrees. Too Rich or too many chips?   Either way, we felt like humpy dumpty. . . I asked my wife to order dessert, because the yelp reviews were amazing. Pumpkin bread pudding and chocolate churro were wasted (we left more than we ate). Now, we were not enjoying the experience. Overbearing noise, Rich food, and flavors all felt the same. Sorry Mission, I can eat...but you failed in making me want to.  . . I know others will disagree, as this place did not lack business.
This place didn't live up to the hype. Went here for lunch on a Saturday. . Positives: . 1. Outdoor seating is great. . 2. Cocktails are fresh. 3. Waiters and Waitresses are attentive. . . Negatives:. 1. We waited close to 40 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered it.. 2. My margarita was way overpriced ($13). 3. I ordered the Kale salad with chicken. The salad was extremely salty. . 4. My lunch date order the taco trio. We were told they were "street" sized, however the  tortillas were approximately 2.5 inches in diameter. It looked like an appetizer. . . Save your money and go somewhere else!
Great food. Great service.   Pork shoulder was amazing and the pork appetizer was great.  We didn't have a reservation and had to wait but it was worth it.
so I made reservation at 5:45, showed up, and told to wait by wait staff because the table is still busy. (sure... there are many other tables available for 1 or 2 ppl). 20 min later I asked, is my table ready, she then looked at the manager, and the manager asked her if I have any reservation. she pointed to my name and he asked for how many ppl, she said 1. and he said only 1!!?. then she seated me to another table (which has been available in the first place). the place is not a place for enjoying your meal. it is a fusion of mexican argentine and peruvian food. in which the food part is pretty good. just don't order any Taco (they are badly made and not sure why). the waitress was very nice and describe the food well, she did not recommended the Taco, next time I would try the short ribs or their speciality pork belly.. I wish they lit up the room a bit, too dark and having a waitress to shine a light on the menu or your food so you can see, doesn't help.. Duck Carnitas Empanada was great.
BEST restaurant in town, especially if you are visiting like my husband and I were from Chicago . We chose this as our only fine dining restaurant for our short trip to celebrate our two year annivesary engagement. I tried making reservations online on opentable.com but when it was full, I called the restaurant and spoke to a nice lady who got me outdoor patio reservations at 8 p.m. on a Thursday night. . . I know it's expensive, but compared to Chicago restaurants, the prices here were worth every penny, and my husband and I thought the prices were fair for the ambiance, and great service. Our waitress had too many tables in my opinion, but she gave everyone fair attention. With a large drink list, we couldn't decide what we wanted, but with some help on flavors, my husband and I got cocktails we both enjoyed along with our dinner. . . We split the corn appetizer dish and the steak taco's. They are the best steak taco's I have ever had. They came in 3, all though we could have requested 4, and a generous amount was on each perfectly cooked corn tortillas. The flavor was intense, I absolutely loved it.. . The presentation and taste of our banana dessert was something I don't regret eating regardless of how many calories it had and how full I was. This restaurant seemed so popular, full of people on dates, walk-ins to bar, girls night out, or just group gatherings. I would definately go back and wish the restaurant was located in Chicago.
Although the food was good, we had an issue with the service.  When asked to accommodate a variation on a menu item the waitress was not willing to even try to the point of rudeness. Then between courses she placed our used silverware that were on our plates back onto the table. When we asked for clean silverware we were given an extremely snide remark by the waitress. Her rudeness ruined the ambiance of the beautiful patio dining.
Awesome place. The food and am since is amazing. It's dark so it's really romantic and has amazing food. I recommend the pork belly. I go with my parents a lot and we all love it and get the same dish. I wouldn't recommend going with a bigger party then 5 and make sure you make a reservation WAY in advance unless u get lucky and find seats at the bar .
This was my first time here and WOW, it was delicious!!! Beyond delicious!! Atmosphere was pure perfection and delightful!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
The food was great, we sat outside in the rear of the restaurant.  You really can't beat the service, very friendly and continually keep your drinks filled.  I had a steak, I can't remember the exact name, but it was great one of the best steaks of ever had. Also, order the guacamole. They prepare it right next to your table fresh.  Great place, I would recommend it to anyone.
We had reservations for the patio a few months back. We arrived on time, we seated promptly at a nice table and brought water immediately. However. It went down hill from there fast. Two different servers came up and introduced themselves as our servers. It felt rushed. We gave one our drink order, only to have the other come up and ask what we would like to drink. What...? The wine came a long while later. We put in an order for a jidori chicken appetizer with a server and some guac made table side. Both were good. For dinner we ordered the diver scallops and another chicken item. Right after one server took our order for entrees, another came up and dropped off dessert menus. What...? Did we not get our entree order in? We will never be sure when the entree orders were put in. Did the server forget? Why did we get dessert menus? It took almost an hour for entrees to come out. Which was fine as the appetizers filled us up. But still. Both entrees were good but I've had comparable food with proper service at other places. My scallops were perfect although I realized I wasn't a big fan of the set it was with. Boyfriend liked his chicken. We were planning to get dessert but after all was said and done I was full and completely turned off by the service. Our bill was somewhere around $130 before tip. I've worked fine dining, I'm still a server. This was the worst service I've ever had, not because the people weren't nice but because it was so chaotic and stressful and the energy was reflected onto the guests. Def not worth $160, which is a lot to us. Lastly, I forgot my sweater there and didn't realize until we got home. I called the restaurant and the host said they had it. I gave them my name and number and said I would be in the following day. I went to pick it up the next morning and it was no where to be found. Kind of ridiculous if you ask me. Save your money. There are so many other wonderful restaurants in Old Town with service that isn't so stressful.
First time visit here. We enjoyed the Margaritas and the appetizer Pozole, which contained some complex flavors. Unfortunately I thought my pork shoulder was fairly dry and lacked overall flavor. My girlfriend's Snapper also was fairly dry and lacked much flavor. We were both underwhelmed for the pretty pricey dishes. We decided we'd go back for the Margaritas and appetizers skipping the expensive dinner.
Went there 2x last year.  Terrific food.  Bread pudding dessert was incredible.  Attentive service.  Beautiful courtyard in the back.  Magical and romantic.  But then the negatives...inside was so dark I could not see the food.  Wait staff carry flashlights so customers can see what they are eating...ridiculous.  waitress said they get complaints all night about the dim lights but the owner refuses to turn them up!!!  It is a little pricey...but ok...I'll pay because the food is really that good...but if they don't turn the lights up so I can see what I am eating then I will not be back.  There is no excuse for such a poorly lit restaurant.  Cannot read the menu, cannot see the food.  Wake up owner...whoever you are...turn the lights on please...you ruin an otherwise amazing dining experience.  ...It was so dark I could barely find the silverware...no kidding!
Excellent guacamole served table side. Avocado margarita unique and worth checking out. I got the skirt steak tacos which were delicious. My husband had the grouper - a little in the dry side. Overall a great meal!
Pros:  Best meal I've had in awhile.  Great margaritas.  Yummy guac.  Perfect portion sizes.  Exceptional chocolate dessert. . Cons:  none
Located in Old Town Scottsdale, AZ, The Mission is amazing. . . For starters, my partner & I ordered the duck confit empanada, which includes foie gras. Of course, being from California where this is outlawed I HAD to have some foie gras! This appetizer was amazing! I could have had seconds but who wants to be a little piggy? Not me!. . Especially when their specialty is pork! . . Mmmm pork. Where do I start? I had the chorizo porchetta & my SO had the pork shoulder tacos. Both were melt in your mouth amazing. I finished off my entree & wanted to lick the plate clean! . . Having heard they are known for their Avocado Margaritas, I was intrigued. You may think WHAT? AVOCADO MARGARITA!??! Rest assured you MUST try one! They are very yummy... You can't taste the avo. It makes it creamy & a uniquely green goodness. . . The service was really really good. Our server was attentive & keen on making sure our drinks & food were served promptly. It was a fine dining experience that didn't feel pretentious. It felt casual and comfortable; the way I like my experience to be. . . I can assure you I will be returning to The Mission the next time I visit Scottsdale. Until then, I'll go back to dreaming about avocado margaritas.
This was the most amazing food I have ever had. Starting with the table side guacamole, every dish we had was presented fabulously only to be outdone by the incredible flavors.. . Hank said "boing!"
