Cheap Mexican food on the strip with absolutely amazing adobada and lengua tacos. Can't rave on more about both meats - you just have to try it!
This place is hands down my favorite place to get Mexican food in LV... hell probably anywhere.  All the food is great quality and you really cant go wrong with anything on the menu (and yes I've tried everything at least once).  The most popular item is easily to adobada tacos which are heavenly and perfect when you're not trying to stuff yourself.  This place is also really cool because anything you see on the menu you can put on top of fries (like carne asada fries style!).  I always find myself coming back to this place and its always a go to when friends come to visit!. . Favorite items: Adobada Tacos (w pineapple), Buche Tacos, Tripe Tacos
Dirty Mexican food definitely hits the spot after a whole day/night of drinking... And Tacos El Gordo is the place to be! Not only is it super cheap ($2/taco) but its super delicious. We got the al pastor, carne asada, and the abodaba (spicy pork) tacos. My favorite was the abodaba (spicy pork). The meat is so juicy and flavorful. I can easily polish off 4 tacos. The carne asada fries are also good. They really pack on the meat and cheese, but wished they put on more guacamole. The fries are good, but I think I'd much rather eat more abodaba tacos! I also got the Horchata, it was OK. It was too watered down, I've had better. Parking isnt bad, saying how busy it is. We parked in a lot thats facing the Wynn, and there was plenty of parking... Easy access to good late night Mexican food!
I cannot stress enough how amazing this place is. The spicy pork taco was our absolute favorite, and when I say favorite, I mean we stayed in Vegas for four full days and went to this hole in the wall place four separate times for their tacos. We had dinner at really nice places and paid $200 for our meal, and this place outshines all other food on the strip at $2 a taco. I mean it. Go here. I am never going to be happy with another taco once I leave here. Absolutely amazing.
When the guy you're ordering tacos from doesn't speak a lick of English, you know you're in the right place.. . My boss who speaks fluent Spanish told me this place is legit so I walked here.. . Just North of Wynn, El Gordo looks like Mexico. Walking in it's kind of confusing to figure out but basically you have to line up by station to order each kind of taco. Inefficient and confusing yes, but you learn quickly. . . My advice: head for the offal station on the right. Rarely a line as white people think it's gross. Cabeza, lengua, buche, tripa, now that's the sh*t I dream about after. . . This is also the 1st taco joint I've been to that makes the tortillas fresh in front of you with a press! . . For under $10 for 4 tacos I can guarantee you that you won't find a better deal in Vegas. . . Te amo Gordo. You is THE Senor.
Adobada tacos. Adobada/carne asada fries. . Dammit!!! Its so good, I'm glad I don't live near one!! I'm sad that I don't!!! . . If you're in Vegas, you have to try this place out! Your tummy will thank you!
I always get the adobada meat! I've tried their fries and taco with the adobada and both were equally good. Can't have Roberto's anymore, gotta drive all the way here for some tacos!
Adobado tacos. No need to order anything else. . . Bit of a walk from the strip but definitely need it to burn the calories from all the tacos you will eat!! . . You must get a side order of the grilled onions and ask for pineapple chunks! Also,  make sure to tip the man slicing the meat! My guy worked very hard and fast to get my 20 orders of the Adobado tacos. . . I didn't taste any difference between this location and the one in Chula Vista.
These tacos are nasty. I have no idea why people love this place. At 2 dollars a taco, I have a sneaking suspicion that this isn't real steak or guacamole. I must say that it is authentic Mexican down to the owners and workers.
The tacos are amazing but their system for ordering is severely flawed. I stood in line for  45 minutes for tacos. Good tacos! But tacos nonetheless. And you can only order the type of tacos that each particular one is for. So if you want the asada AND the adobada then you'll have to wait in line again to get those.
The adobada fries are the things that dreams are made of!
Best tacos in the US! The only ones that I know that beat this for the price were in Guadalajara.
The tacos are authentic and delicious. I am staying at the palazzo so it is a short walk, and totally worth it. It is actually nice to be able to walk of the food coma induced by inhaling 8 tacos. Adobada taco is my favorite but asada tacos are great too.
Wow this place was awesome. I sometimes drive past this location and always see a line out the door. I tried each of the tacos and they're all great! Come early!....
As others have said, you MUST order the taco adobado (or two, or three). The meat is carved from a giant skewer and is perfectly seasoned. Order it with everything ("con todo"). FYI, this is NOT a spicy food.. . Tried the carne asada- only average. If you're adventurous try the tongue ("lengua") or other useful animal parts (I didn't, so mangiador emptor).. . Don't be intimidated if you don't speak spanish- they're used to gringos. Take the walk- it's good for you and definitely worth it.
Awesome food. Some of the best tacos I've ever had! The adobada is phenomenal.  This place is a must visit in vegas!
It has been ages since I have been back to Tacos El Gordo and I always wonder why I don't come more often. . . The tacos are delicious. I always end up with adobada, no matter how hard I try to order outside my comfort zone. Everything else looks amazing, but when I'm starving for tacos, this is my go to meat. Since there are separate lines for each meat, it's best to come in a group and plan your ordering accordingly so you and your dining companions can split up and tackle the lines more efficiently.
I love this place and used to frequent the locations in San Diego for years. I am so glad that they are following me everywhere I go! Authentic tacos just like I'm sitting at the border ordering 10 tacos (okay maybe 4).  I love the adobada the most, then carne asada, then lengua.  Try this place out you won't be disappointed.
One word Excellent !!
Definitely my new favorite go to restaurant in Vegas.  Found this place today and had an awesome meal which was real authentic Mexican.
Lengua tacos! Those lengua tacos are what they're known for and I seriously have been daydreaming of them ever since my first visit.... . I arrived here around 10 pm and there were TONS of people waiting in line to order. The place was pretty chaotic and it was pretty confusing at first knowing where to line up. I guess there were certain lines for each type of meat, but it really doesn't matter because the cooks all communicate with each other anyway.. . So I had their lengua tacos, buche tacos, and their campechana (half carne asada/half lengua) fries and it was just heaven on a platter! Probably the priciest hole in the wall mexican joint I've been to, but the quality is there!. . Don't forget to ask for the sauces at the checkout counter. I found that the fries were on the dry side and the sauces made a huge difference in the taste. . . I would highly recommend anyone in Vegas to go here and try it out. I already know that I'm stopping here every time I'm in the city from now on. They just need to open one in LA now.
I simply can't write a bunch of taco reviews without talking about this place. The savior of all taco shops - Tacos el Gordo. No, they are not paying me to say that.. . Why savior? Just walk in and witness the cluster of people forming a loose line to get their tacos from a counter. You will think it will take forever. You will think "why is everyone here but not on the line to the right/left?" You will think "why is there a line around the corner?" "What does that mean?" "I can eat a brain?". . I can address some of your thoughts. No, it will not take forever. They're surprisingly quick because their meats are sliced off gyro-style and assembled sloppy and deliciously. Ingredients are not skimped on. You will get you share of meat and plenty of toppings. Also, it's grease central.. . There are many lines because each line offers different selections of meats. One offers more common cuts of porkand beef, while another might have the exotic, acquired bits. You can always ask what different words mean, but chances are they got asked enough to put a translation by way of sticker in English just below the item name.. . I would bet you're going to under-order and you're going to go back for more. You'll find your "taco sweet spot" and you'll know next time that you can knock out five, maybe six of them back to back. They are highly addictive and open pretty much all the time. At around $2 a pop, it's going to be tough to avoid coming here repeatedly if you're in the area.
3 1/2 stars. . . My gf mentioned this place so we decided to check it out on Sunday before we headed back to LA. Parking is pretty big and the line was even bigger. Menu is pretty simple. Interesting was that the line forms in 4- 5 different sections. If you want pork then there's a line section just for pork, And same for beef and so on. It can get a little hectic and kind of sucks because you have to keep getting in different lines just to get a  few things. The pork line was pretty fast, my gf waited in the beef line for at least 30 min or more. . . _Taco de Adobadas (spicy pork taco $2.00) the most popular and the BEST! They slice the pork real thin right in front of you. The pork isn't too spicy but just enough flavor. The green sauce gives it a nice little kick and sweetness. Add some lime on top and it's the perfect bite. I could have had 3 of these.. oops already happened!. _Taco de Asada. (steak taco $2.00) I'm never a huge fan of beef taco because normally the beef comes out dry, But I thought this place may be different. Turns out I was right. The beef was a bit dry and after eating the pork taco the beef just did not cut it for me. I wish they added more guacamole sauce.. _Taco de Suadero (beef shoulder $2.00) The beef shoulder was a bit juicier than the steak taco.  I would pick this over the Asada but still the Pork is the best!. _Carne Asada fries ($10) huge portion. We shared this with myself and 3 other girls. It can get quite heavy and rich but so hard to put the fork down. I would do the Adobadas fries instead. . _Adobadas Tostada. ($2.00) This was pretty good. The crunch factor from the tortilla was nice and the pork was again amazing! . . I would come here again just for the spicy pork taco and would like to try their sopes. I'm more of a fish taco person so don't go all crazy on me on my rating :) BTW great place to eat after a hangover.
Living in San Diego for over 17 years spoiled me, as there are 4 tacos elgordo locations in south east county, and a few in TJ Mexico, I remember the good old days of going to caliente betting on football games all day, hitting Chicago Club or Adalitas girlie bars then heading to tacos elgordo for some of the best tacos you will ever eat in your life. . I love the pork that is sliced off a rotisserie . the lengue tacos are amazing as are the asada and cabeza.. Now when the wife, daughter and I are in Vegas for our annual 6 days trip, we make sure we hit up tacos elgordo atleast 3 times.. Love it Love Love it
I was on a business trip in Vegas when I discovered Tacos El Gordo - it was definitely the BEST hidden gem on the strip! . . Like any other review, this place has good, affordable tacos! I ordered 4 of the adobada (spicy pork) tacos, and i definitely could have more! Each taco is served in a mini corn tortilla. At $2 each, you can't go wrong!!! I am sad that I didn't get to try the carne asada fries, so that's a must for my next visit to sin city. . . This location is about a 10 minute walk from The Wynn, so it is definitely very convenient for those staying there.. . I highly recommend this place if you're looking for good, affordable food on the strip!!
Everything from quesadillas to beef brain tacos, everything is tasty! I love this place so much! My friends and I were all getting tired, but we had to drive back to Saint George that night and everyone wanted tacos. We tried other places, but most of them were 21+ and one of my friends wasn't 21, so we found Tacos El Gordo. . When we got there, it seemed to have a long line trailing outside, but it didn't take long until we were inside ordering.. Their spicy pork tacos are to die for! And if you order peppers and onions, beware! They are super tasty, but way spicy (and I can handle a lot of spice)!. I have recommended this to everyone going to Vegas because it is totally worth it and is super close to everything on the strip.. Go to Tacos El Gordo, you won't regret it!!!
I tried the sesos (brains) for the first time. It was like eating soft tofu. The spicy pork tacos is where it's at. . . Absolutely simple and delicious.
Great $2 tacos, right on the strip! I tried the horchacha it was was pretty good too.  Like all the other reviews note, beware of the line-ups. Tried the beef shoulder, spicy pork, and steak tacos.  The spicy pork were the best by far.  The smokey flavour of the steak was very overpowering.
Best value on the strip. The fries can't be beat. The large order is probably too much for your average person.
This place is the bombbbbbbb! Some may think $2/taco is kinda steep but I actually think it's worth it. Can't remember exactly but I know it was either a Friday or Saturday night when we went, and it was busy but the wait wasn't too bad. My husband and I had 3 tacos each, sampling the carne asada, spicy pork, plus horchata. Unfortunately, the horchata was just from a vending machine so it wasn't the best but like I said the tacos were def bomb and off the hook. We always look forward to hitting up Tacos El Gordo whenever we are out on the strip now!
Al Pastor is the best. Had a late night taco session requiring immediate action. My neighbor from TJ said, these are the shiznit, and he was RIGHT! Not fatty, real rotisserie style meat, guacamole sauce, cebollitas y jalapeno on the grill. A+++ The only train they don't get 5 on it is because their set up sucks, and it takes like 45 min standing in line, and you stand in different lines for different meat. stand in line for specific meat, then go pay and get your cup, and finish off with your beverage. I also had the fries with asada...good fries, but the asada was like a B. All that being said, this will be added to my Vegas eatery rotation every time i visit. 4 tacos de asada con todo porfa....
OMg ... of course I had to visit them... I PREFer this one wayyyy better than San Diego ones......... Had Tacos de tripa..... yummy yummy      and al pastor...with a can coke... super deliciously Goooooood!!!!!!!!!. . love it...   had them Saturday and Sunday... make sure to order a quesadilla only with cheese... super delicious
Tacos - adobada/pastor, asada, lengua, grilled onions & peppers.. . We saw this place while walking down the strip and there was a big crowd so we had to try them out. The lines moves very quickly, so don't be turned off by them. We were at the front of the line before we even decided what we were getting. The food was ready immediately. I saw the person next to me order the grilled onions & peppers, so I asked for them and was surprised to find out they were free. I wish they had that on the menu because I wouldn't have known if I hadn't seen someone else ask for them. We got our tacos with everything on them and the sauces were perfect.. . I really liked that they told us we could bring our beers in here. So, we sat in their outdoor tent with our tacos & beer!. . Fast, affordable, convenient, authentic, and delicious, love it! I'm from the DMV area and we don't have authentic tacos like these around here. I was in heaven!
We were eating in less than 5 minutes. Might be the best mexican food I ever had. Friendly staff and perfect food. Anyone not giving it 5 stars probadly prefers Chevys or Chipotle.  I'm 100% Mexican and I approve this message.
Found this spot through the yelp app. Thank god we did!  Best tacos in Vegas!  Prices are also great!!
Everyones revoews sound great for this place so I went to check it out. The food needs so much flavor. There was no salt, no salsa and worst of all I ordered tacos al pastor (spicy pork meat) and they told me it would be 20 min for them when 3 others ordered it after me and got them right on the spot. I would not return here at all... once I got home I opened the tacos, they fell apart, all I did was take it out of the foil... worst service ever.
The asada taco is very good, but adobada taco is an eye-opening flavor explosion.  We went for a two-taco snack, finished, and got back in line for more.  Every order is freshly made, including the tortilla for the asada tacos.  The whole operation is very efficient, but the wait is still somewhat long due to sheer volume.  Worth it.  So worth it.
So we were told by boo's dad that we must visit this place in Vegas...so we did.. I can tell you that it is super easy to pass on the strip but it is in a plaza adjacent to Walgreens and they have little tents out front where you can sit and eat.. . The menu is very basic, you tell the cook what you want and they cook it up right in front of you. I think I had steak tacos...I can't remember. I think boo had the same thing. They were pretty good but it was nothing exciting to me. I think I was still on a high from the 24 hour joint in San Diego. I guess I should have gotten the spicy pork tacos?. Apparently we beat the rush because there was a super long line of people waiting to order after we sat down and ate. They have soft drinks that taste like floats that are pretty tasty.
Tacos are good!  I feel like I'm back in So cal at a taco truck.  Except this isn't quite as cheap.. . Long lines, but they move quickly.  Prices are decent... $2 each, but the fries are a little high.  They add a lot of meat, but I would just get a half order instead of paying $10 for fries. . . Hours are great.. They're open super late and they have plenty of seating.  Parking can be a little tough but its not bad.. . If I am in the mood to wait, I will be back.
So I had heard a lot about Tacos El Gordo, but never thought much about it. I usually don't care for tacos that much, and it seemed like just another taco place to me. After my friends kept making a big deal aboutit, I decided to try it on a Monday night. Upon arriving, I was surprised at how many people were there, standing in line at 11 pm. Despite the long lines, the service was quick, prompt, and ran in a very strategic way.. . My first visit there, I decided to try 2 adobada tacos with everything on them. Upon eating my first taco, I couldn't stop myself from shoving the second one in my mouth and getting back in line for more tacos. It was so tasty and flavorful! The sauces mixed so well with the juicy meat, and complemented each other perfectly. My second round I decided to try the carne asada tacos which also drove my taste buds wild. Everything tasted and actually was fresh! The meat and tortillas are made right in front of you, how can it get any better than that? . . Tacos El Gordo is one of the best taco places here in Vegas. It gave me a reason to pay $2 for a taco, hopefully it amazes you too.
Best Dam tacos EVER !!! Theirs a lot of pple for a reson..b/c the tacos and food is on HIT !!' Yummy ...2 tacos
I got the spicy pork tacos. Extremely good, probably the best street tacos ive ever had. These guys are very authentic. If you want a dining experience, you will be dissapointed. These are street tacos! This place is absolutely about one thing, and they do it well.
This place is soooooo authentic. Beef tongue, tripe, brain tacos. Of course I kept it simple and ordered the spicy pork and steak tacos. I love love love this place. it's so good, you must go the next time you are in Vegas. And don't bring much money here, you won't need it! (good deal!).
I am so sad I could not give them five stars. The best authentic Mexican food this aide of the border.  Flavors burst into your taste buds as you try to remember what tacos you ever tasted better then these. NEVER. EVER. Teajuana bases flavor.  El Gordo has the cooking down to a fine science.  Like most Mexican restaurants they need a gringo to fix the traffic jam of customers trying to spend their money.  Walking into this Maze of people you think of a Chinese fire drill. Walk in four feet and it looks like the 405 and the 710 freeway meet.with a little more planning this place could triple their income. Poor design.  Not customer friendly.  Each item, different line. Booooo!  I would love to complain to someone that would make a difference. Make the right move for your Mexican audience.  They will come.
