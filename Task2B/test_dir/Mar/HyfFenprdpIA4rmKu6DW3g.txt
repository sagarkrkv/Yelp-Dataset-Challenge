This place is absolutely great.  This has to be at least my 10th trip there.  It's a must each time I visit Las Vegas. And now since they are open 24 hours, i often frequent twice a day.  Gumbo, Pan Roast, Chowder...All declicious.
No matter what always a must have meal and stop in vegas. Been coming here for over 10 years. The house pan roast is what they're famous for, but the jambalayaand clam steamers are also among my favorites. . . This place is located inside the old Palace Station Casino off the strip. its been popular among the locals, but words have spread over the years and many out of towners will still come and wait in line for this hidden gem in the dessert. They have also changed the hours to 24hrs a few years back, so you can come to have a bowl of this tasty creole food anytime of the day. Sitting is limited to the bar counter and we found out you do have to be 21 & over to be served.
One of the best I have tried!  I usually order the Gumbo, Etouffee and Manhattan Clam Chowder but everything is good there. The line speaks for itself! Good thing that its open 24-7 but expect to wait at least an hr or more during prime time. We usually go around 10am for lunch and 4pm for dinner to cut wait time. Depend if you would see this as a good thing or not, everyone can alternate waiting in line while the rest donates money to the machines and when your done eating and don't want to wait for the slow eater, go donate some more.. . Service:. Is wonderful 4/5 times which is understandable as these guys work their butts off. Regardless, they always try to put on a smile and still have a sense of humor with good spirit. . . Atmosphere:. Since its a bar setting (well, obviously)  you know what your eating and how clean it is because they cook everything right in front of you.
Got here at 9am on a Monday and what do ya know??? Only two people there besides me!!! It's the MAGIC HOUR!!! Woohoo! Ordered the Alaskan Chowder and a tequila oyster shooter! Great chef, Thanks EZ...Great Waitress and good company next to me! By 945 it was only one seat open!!! I'll be back Palace Station!
This place is crazy good! They make the food in front of you in these kettles that are built into the bar. Sometimes Im not sure which one is mine since there is literally no-stop business here.. . The place is literally a bar with very limited seating and there is ALWAYS a line. I went at 2am and had to wait 45 minutes to sit down. It is definitely worth the wait though.. . I ordered the pan roast and it is some of the best food I have ever had. The pan roast reminds me of curry and is delicious. Its so good that I am now on a mission to find something similar to it in my hometown (ive been told it will never be as good as the one at Palace Station tho).. . Highly recommend everyone tries this place out. Food is good, food is fresh and the line is justified.
What? Why? I need to go at like 10:18am on a ..Tuesday or something odd so I'm not in line salivating watching the chefs make eyes at customers as if they are better than us (because they are).. . First timers: JUST GET A PAN ROAST AND DON'T **** WITH THE OTHER STUFF.. . Someone needs to write a review on all the different chefs.  I know one guy make it spicier than the other, one guy stirs it differently than the other, one guy is really sarcastic so be prepared...
This place serves my favorite clam chowder in the whole wide world.  And because it's open 24 HRS, there are times I have seriously considered jumping in my car in the middle of the night and driving all the way to Vegas (I'm in the OC, a 4 hr drive away) to indulge in their Alaskan chowder.  I haven't done it yet, but just wait, one of these days, I definitely will.. . Only downside is how dinky this place is (a counter with only 15 seats or so) and there is always a wait and the line moves so slowly.  But it's definitely worth it, even though it's torture to see all the diners tucking in to their dishes right in front of you.  Pan roast is pretty good here but I'm not a big fan of jasmine rice, I wish they served it with either Uncle Ben's or a short grain (yes, I know I am very picky when it comes to rice).  I have yet to try the gumbo, will have to give it a whirl the next time I'm in town.
The wait may be long, but the pan roasts are the best in the city.  You won't regret standing in line for one.
This place is hands down some of the best food i have ever eaten, the 2 hour wait was WORTH IT, the shrimp and lobster fra diavolo over linguini is the best fra diavolo ive ever had in my whole god damn life, the staff are amazing as well, i will be coming back here and recommending this gem to every person on the fuckin planet.
After being told by numerous people to check this place out, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a go. . . We went on a Monday around lunch time, and there was a line. Took maybe 15-20 min of waiting (not bad). . . This place is really small. No tables. Just a bar with about 10-15 spots. . . The waitress that helped us that day was so nice and funny! . . **another thing, you have to be over 21 to even eat here (so incase you have kids or under 21).. . We both got the pan roast with lobster, crab, and shrimp. . . I got my heat 5 and my boyfriend got his heat 2. They were both so delicious! I really wish I could have finished the whole thing but it really fills you up! They offer a take out container also. . . This is my new go to spot in Vegas. I don't care how long the wait is! It's awesome.
OMG THIS PLACE IS AMAZING AND DEFINITELY WORTH THE LONG WAIT!!!!!. . If you're drunk and with your friends waiting, time will fly by fast. The way the place is laid out is in the casino area of Palace Station, literally looks like a little bar area, and seats no more than 15-20 people, TOPS. My friend, bf and I waited like an hour. LADIES, make sure you switch your heels from the club/dayclub with some comfy flip flops or flats!!!! You will thank me later. . . I have this tendency where I order too much food when I'm drunk, but with waiting for an hour, WHO CARES?!!! SO NOW ONTO THE FOOD!!!!. . OYSTER SHOOTERS:. MMM YUMMY. Super refreshing AND OYSTERS WERE FRESH TO DEATH. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. . . COMBO PAN ROAST:. My friend and I got one each... and it was sooooo goood. It came with shrimp, lobster and crab and the texture of the orange stewy sauce was soooo succulent and eating it with the scoop of rice they give you on top is just simply amazing. . . BOUILLABAISSE:. My boyfriend got this, and it had noodles in it and was a little more soupy but still had some stewy texture. He says it's HIGHLY COMPARABLE to bouillabaisse in the EAST COAST and Oyster Bar is the best place for it on the westside. . . ALASKAN CLAM CHOWDER: . OMG THIS CHOWDER IS SO GOOD. PROBABLY THE BEST CLAM CHOWDER I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. It comes with shrimp, crab, lobster, and of course, CLAMS, and the chowder is so RICH in flavor and the PERFECT AMOUNT of saltiness. GET IT MANHATTAN STYLE or New England style. . . Be ready to pass out for about an hour or two before you rage some more... this place hits the spot and is definitely amazing COMFORT FOOD. Even the NEXT MORNING we reheated all of the leftovers in our hotel and it still tasted SO AMAZING. I URGE YOU to make time for this place if you're a seafood and stew lover if you're ever in VEGAS. . . Hope this helped! ;)
Ahh! Such a disappointment. I know I still gave it 3 stars, but for the long wait it should really be even less. . . We got a dozen oysters, the clam chowder that everyone raves about and the combination pan roast. . . The dozen oysters were fresh and decent sized. It came with a side of horseradish and lemon. There were also plenty of hot sauces around to try. Overall, good. . . The clam chowder was the biggest bust of them all. It's good clam chowder I'll give you that. There are plenty of good pieces of clams in it. But come on... Best ever? I think not. It's ordinary.. . The combination pan roast was a good spicy Cajun type dish. It had a good amount of seafood (although looking around, other people with the same dish had more so maybe we were just getting punked). We ordered an 8 level of spicy and some how it was like a 10. We tried our friend 10 and ours was even spicier than his. Not even enjoyable to eat. Few bites in and we were done with it. . . The place is super small and severely understaffed. There is one chef cooking at 6 steam kettles and also shucking all the oysters. There is one or two waitresses at a time and they do everything!! Taking orders, serving alcohol, bussing tables, bringing checks, packing take out, etc. yeah it's typical stuff but they were really working super hard. No wonder the wait takes sooooo long. I don't blame then but there has gotta be a faster way of doing things.. . Overall, the food was decent but I really wouldn't wait that long again. It's just not that exciting to me to waste a day in Vegas over this.
Decent oysters.. Had the combo Pan Roast at level 10 spice. . Tasted pretty good with a nice kick.. The wait is a pain and my return to eat here would be based on how long the line is.
I have never waited this long for any restaurant ever !!!.  . My boyfriend kept talking about this place EVERY time we came to vegas, so of course we decided to come. . . The first time we came, we were lucky only waited about 45 minutes. I ordered the gumbo which was amazing. They ask how spicy 1-10 you want it.  I got 7 and it was spicy. If you can't handle a lot of spice, I would suggest you get 5 or lower. They cook everything right in front of you which is pretty cool. My bf got the panroast which is the most popular. Although it was good, I enjoyed my gumbo more. . . Second time I decided to get the jambalaya which was also appetizing. Stepped down my spice from 7 to 5.. . Always a generous amount of seafood into your dish and the servers are friendly.. . At least there's slot machines around you to kill some time!
This place is amazing! I would've never known about it if a local Las Vegas resident hadn't taken me. We went at around 2:30 a.m. and ended up waiting about 45 minutes to sit down because this place is literally a bar where they cook the food in front of you, so only about 12-16 people can be seated at a time. Trust me, it's worth the wait! . . I ordered the House Gumbo with a spice level of 5 or 6 (can't remember) and it wasn't super spicy, it was soooooo good and the fact that they make it in front of you is even better. This will now be on my list of places I must eat at every time I'm in Vegas. Highly recommended!
This is definitely a hole in the wall place. The food in my opinion is as good as what many reviewers said on Yelp. . . The oyster bar is essentially a bar setting. Therefore, it only has 15 bar stools at this place. It took an hour and a half to get seated. But if you want to play a slot machine or you are a smoker, this is where you can kill time by doing both while you are waiting.. . Even though there was a long wait, it was worth it. I ordered a half dozen oysters and it was fresh and had a sweet taste to it. For entree, I had a combo pan roast seafood. The texture and flavor was delicious. . . The chef, Bob, and the waitress made the whole experience well worth it as they are the only two people working during that shift. They cracked jokes as they made you feel like you are at home dining.
Loved this place! Only 20 seats or so in a bar-type set up, so definitely not ideal for a big group. Best for a couple. At times you have to wait 1+ hours but it's worth it.  The hot roasts we so good and easily shared between 2 or as great leftovers.  Rich and filling. So much flavor, can't wait to go back!  Didn't try the oysters though, doh!
After many years of living here, I've only been to the Palace Station 3 times. THREE! My roomie dragged me here cause he said that they have good oysters. Like freshly good!  I didn't drive so I didn't care where he was taking me.. . This is an oyster bar, it has a bar set up, therefore you have to be 21+ years old. The wait line is kinda awkward cause it's by the rewards center and slot machines. The wait was about hour to hour and half. Yup, line was long. I had a couple beers while waiting. Yeah, I got drunk. But hey, at least I remembered what I ordered.. . Ordered the shooters which was 3 for $10. If you got vodka, they add a bloody mary mix. Spicy, lemony, oystery, and vodka-y. For main dish, ordered the lobster gumbo with level 7 spiciness. They start cooking your food right in front of you. You will start tearing up because you're so hungry. The bottom line to the dishes is that it was AMAZEBALLS. Spiciness was perfect. Amount of lobster and sausage...yum!. . Service was good. You can tell that the chef loves his job. Watching him cook was like watching a T.V. show. There are two other servers and they will get you other things (water, beer, or more oysters).. . Will come back again! But I wil have one of my friends to stand in line for me. Must stop for some New England/Southern/Seafood food.
