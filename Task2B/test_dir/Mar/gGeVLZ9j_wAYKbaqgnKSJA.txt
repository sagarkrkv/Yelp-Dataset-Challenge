So many choices, so we went with the recommendations of our really great waiter. Had the spicy tuna over crispy rice and the lobster steamed wonton - really unique and so delicious. Shared the SeaBass and donuts for dessert - yes donuts! Would definitely return here.
My girlfriend and I went to Tao Saturday night. We ordered the Saki sampler which is 3 different shots of Saki. If you are not familiar with Saki this is a great introduction. For my entree I ordered the Chilean sea bass, this was the highlight of the meal, subtle flavors of ginger, fish melting in your mouth.  My girlfriend ordered the Buddah chicken. The chicken is marinaded with a sweet and sour flavor, also very good and bit less pricey then the other dishes (29.00) We ended up spending 150.00 for 2 people including appetizers and drinks which I felt was a good value. Price range between 150-200.00 for 2 people which is not bad at all considering the quality.
Bottom line: Expensive, but worth it!. . I tried the tuna tartar, the Chilean sea bass, the Chinese sausage fried rice, and the shrimp tempura.  All if it was amazing.  The tuna was my favorite.  We also had the donuts for dessert and the sauces they came with were amazing.  I also took my 4 1/2 year old with us (5pm) and they said they don't have many children come in, but they did a great job to accommodate us.  I will go back for sure!
I got a craving for Asian food last time I was in Vegas and Yelp led me to this place... The food was delicious. The restaurant was very busy with people waiting for tables, yet I never felt rushed. Our server was kind and didn't seem bothered by the fact that I took my time deciding what I wanted to order. The cocktails were not the best, I sent back my "geisha" drink twice before they got it within an acceptable range.
Came here with 3 other people, we made our reservations for 7:30, and were seated immediatly after we checked in with the hostess. . . THe interior is very dark, and the atmosphere was fun, our waiter was really great and attentive.. . We ordered a few different maki rolls, some veggie tempura and the kimchi/lobster fried rice. All of the food was phenomenal. I have to do minus one star because the service was slow. Over 20 minutes for our drinks, after our plates were cleared over 15 minutes for our check.
Service was good and upstairs club was crazy crowded with sausage and girls pretending to have fun. Food was just okay.  Had filet and sushi pad tai dessert was excellent big fortune cookie. And lot's of hot young girls at overcrowded club. Not for me but for everyone else.
One of the sexiest places I have been to. Atmosphere, food and service are all 5 stars. Great music too. Their rolls and chocolate lava cake with coconut ice cream are to die for.
Tao has to be a top five place for me. If there was one close to  my home I'd go at least once a week. Only problem about that is their are only two in the states! One thing I love about Tao is the atmosphere is way different then anything else I've ever attended. I love the Budda statue, the dark/night time atmosphere, and also guys, the ladies dress up stunningly. Even with all these great features it all comes down to the food. The food well.... It's absolutely AMAZING!!! The Kobe beef is so wonderful! Very tender of course. The Peking Duck is flavorful with a great Hosin sauce. With all these great choices the best to me was the sea bass with Miso glaze.
Amazing dinner, amazing restaurant!  Had a great time with a fun atmosphere and our waiter was awesome!  He gave great recommendations and was very attentive.  The low lighting and fun ambiance just helped make the experience intimate but popular.  . I had the wasabi crusted filet mignon and my friend had the honey ginger salmon- both were to die for and perfectly cooked!  To top off the evening, we had the scrumptious donuts with dipping sauces and and delicious fortune cookie with chocolate and vanilla mousse... Oh my it was delightful!  Highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!!  Must go place!
Very nice dining experience, food is amazing! For appetizer we ordered lobster dumplings and spice tuna tartar, love them both. Entree we had omakase chefs choice sushi plate and Seabass, both were delicious! Price is reasonable and I'm positive that I'll visit them again for my next trip to Vegas!
