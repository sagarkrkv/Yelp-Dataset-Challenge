Tried a slice after dinner wanted to a get another. Just that good. No it was better then good. Please don't tell anyone where it's at, so it doesn't get crowded. It was like being back in the big apple.
OMGAWWWWWWWD! Where is this place?!! No signs, nothing. Had to call twice! Lol!! Thanks for the friendly service. we're hereeeeee and the pizzas are awesome. We got the white, mushroom and veg one. Crispy, light, expensive and delish!
I don't really see what the hype is about.  The pizza was nothing spectacular and the line was super long.  To top it off, the service was pretty crappy.  The boyfriend and I ordered 2 slices of pepperoni pizza and they told us to wait about 15 minutes for a newly baked pepperoni pizza.  Over 20 minutes later and my boyfriend finally went to inquire about our slices, even though we were standing right across from the cashier.  She forgot about us and we stood there longer than we had to.  Nothing special but if you have a hankering for pizza and you're at the Cosmo, then by all means, this is the place for you.  Just don't expect anything spectacular.
Great pizza, a little pricey, great service a definite place to stop and try for a quick bite .
all HYPE. BUT the pizza at 2am is amazing tho LOL. . secret tip. call ahead if your ordering a pie. it takes 20 mins if you wait
That was an awesome slice of pie. I am very satisfied. I will be coming here every time I come to Las Vegas. It is always amazing when you find a special gem like this one.
The best pizza on the strip ! Meat lovers all the way. Never been here before glad we found it. Prices are great as well.  Make sure to stop here if sober or drunk pizza is bomb
Must have if you can find it......tucked away in a hallway near STK. Great 3 am pizza!
So yummy and cheap and in Vegas!!!  We ate here every night we stayed in vegas.   It was damn good and the crust was amazing for thin crust.  This was some of the best pizza I have ever had and its only $5 per slice.
The pizza was pretty good and for a meal in Vegas it wasn't badly priced.   I had the white pizza due to my addiction to garlic and I can't remember what my husband had, but I would guess two slices of the cheese.  I will admit the pizza was slightly greasy but you don't eat pizza when you are trying to be healthy.   The guys behind the counter were very friendly.  We chatted with them for a bit while we were eating.   We didn't go after clubbing so they weren't too busy, but I would call it asteady stream of people though for a tucked away location.
5 stars because the pizza was and is still soooo goddddamn delicious...Oh god just thinking of it makes me droool & yearn for that hot sticky ricotta cheese melting in my mouth..that Strong smell of Garlic seeping through that crappy white cardboard pizza box...oh my god I would make sweet love to you...But I'd rather just eat you up...NOM NOM NOM! The White Pie Pizza (Parmesan, Ricotta, Garlic)...you cannot go wrong with that....Yes 3 years later and STILL hands down the best pizza joint in Vegas...yes I dont care if its on the strip...in the most bougiest of hotels ever (I dont have to go on about the crowd - but the point is to go in, order the pizza and get out and back to your room and eat like thenfat girl screaming inside you to let her out)...
For the not so secret, Secret Pizza, 5 stars for you! . . Ever since discovering the magical corridor, I make Secret Pizza a Vegas trip must! . . I don't know what the addicting part of this place is, but I love it! Is it the pizza? Is it the 'secret'? It's probably both.. heh. . Anywho, me and my friends usually split the same thing every single time: A white pie with sausage. Why change something you know and love? We've also tried other pizzas but this one has remained true and steady to our hearts.. . A pie can cost you around $25-30 depending on what you get and if you add anything. Your choice, your money. Of course, they also sell by the slice premade but we also order a fresh one and just wait, sometimes 20-30 minutes for our pie.. . There's a water cooler for drinks as well as beverages for purchase. The interior is a vintage arcade meets pizza parlor and there are several pinball and video game machines for those waiting. . . Seating can be a bit meh, but we always just eat outside near the pool tables or on the long tables along the side by the restrooms. . . FYI, for those that do not know the secret yet.. 3rd floor Cosmo!
Authentic New York Pizza hidden in an uber modern, posh Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. . . Secret pizza is located on the third floor of the Cosmo. If you see a hallway with old, kitschy records (vinyl y'all) and what appears to be a pin ball machine, winner, winner chicken dinner! Follow your nose and prepare to drool. . . It's like the hole in the wall pizza by the slice places in NYC. There are no thrills. A pizza counter and guys making fresh dough and heating slices. A single slice is HUGE and is $4.50/$5.00 a slice. Trust me, you'll only need one.  They also sell whole pies, beer, soda, and 2 liters.. . My favorite is the White Pie is my favorite. Garlicky, creamy, gooey dough heaven. My second favorite is the plain cheese. How you know the pizza is good? My mama is a New Yorker. She taught me that when you pick a slice up, the bottom half is droopy and the slice can be folded in half (taco shape). Secret Pizza does alllllll of this.. . Pro Tip: If you don't want to brave the strip, the same delectable pizza is available on the West Side of town by Those Guys Pies.
After searching for this place for ten minutes, my buddies and I grew irritated. Once we finally found it, thanks to a groupof drunk girls who kept yelling "pizzaaa" as they made their way to Secret, we couldn't have been more impressed. NY style pizza by the slice! So good. Keep in mind, it's in a hallway, near STK, on the 3rd floor.. . The fact that it's "pricey" shouldn't deter people from visiting this spot. The pizza absolutely justifies it! It's almost routine now- Go to Marquee till 2am, then end up at Secret to enjoy the delicious pizza and sober up, Lol.
I accidentally stumbled upon this little shop trying to find a taxi a few years back. I don't know how I ended up there, but it was the best drunk mistake I have ever made. Lmao. I honestly never thought I'd find pizza as good as the lil shop we used to go to in Manhattan, but oh man.. This place is crazy good ! This is our go to after Marquee Mondays, every Monday. Hahaha. I love how it's so hidden. Gives us a head start before the drunk non-locals start heading out of the club. I'm personally a 'no meat on my pizza' typa gal, so I stick with the amazing "White Pizza". I've heard the sausage and pepperoni pizzas are good as well. They have gran. garlic, parm, and chili shakers so you can top your slice. I love all three on mine. Yeah, I guess you can say it's a bit pricey, but sooooo worth it. Just keep in mind, if you're trying to buy 4 slices or so, it's best to just go and buy a whole pizza.
Over Hyped.. I came here and waited in line for 30 minutes for a slice of greasy, flavorless pizza. I'm a pizza love and there is nothing bette rthsn a great slice after a night out. Honestly, I would have been happier with a slice from domino's (barf). It might have been good when it was actually "hidden" but definitely isn't up to par now that the secret is out.
Oh such yummy pizza after a night out on The Strip.  This location is kind of hidden but all the tips on yelp helped us find this place.  The location is small.  The White Pizza was so yummy.  The slices are pretty big. It was just so yummy.  Don't expect to have a seat anywhere as space is limited.
Secret?? I don't think so. I found this place immediately thanks to the great photos of the vintage records lined hallway by yelpers, and the aroma from the same hallway. . . The people walking out of the hallway with slices of pizza also was an easy clue too. . . I arrived around 9 ish and there was a small line. I ordered a white pizza and it was a bargain at $5. It's not enough for a hearty meal but good enough for a quick snack or a light meal.  Thin crust and garlicky flavor in each bite. Excellent pizza and worth the wait.. . There's limited counter space to eat and most people can't seem to bus their own trash. Walk out of the hall and there's sofas where you can eat at. Great late night snack place. . . Minus 1 star for the non smiling staff. Yes it's a busy place, and customers who don't know what they want can seem to be a pain, but don't forget that Vegas is a tourist town. You work inside a hotel... So treat your customer with a smile. It's not that hard.
Im from California and I've never been a fan of the thin pizzas. But after having a slice of this heavenly goodness, i am obsessed with thin pizza. It definitely isn't filling but it is a must try and quick meal to have before drinking or going out. Its big enough to enjoy but small enough to keep u from getting bloated
Triple "F"!! = Funny, Fast, Friendly! Delicious pizza, good for on the run. Happy we discovered this place because it is truly "secret"!!
Awesome"after the club" pizza place!! Cool staff, generous slices and you gotta try the white slice!! I was staying in the Cosmo and this place was recommended to me, so I have to pay it forward and tell you guys you gotta try it!! Enjoy!!
This place is definitely no longer a secret. Which is OK with me, because they crank out slices pretty quickly. The perfect Vegas night ends here. Expect to pay $5 for a slice and not have many words spoken to you by the cashier (they are probably so sick of listening to drunk people in the middle of the night). The pizza is REALLY good though. NY Style and freshly warmed for your order. I'd recommend the cheese and the ricotta and meatball.
Inside The Cosmopolitan at a 'secret' location, there are no visible signs pointing you to Secret Pizza. However, just look for a line of people that'll lead you up to a counter filled with meaty pizza pies to take away.. . They bake pizzas with various toppings - sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, bell peppers, etc. or just plain cheese. You can take slices or request a whole pie with your choice of toppings. You can also add toppings to an existing pre-made pizza, and they'll pop the slice back into the oven for a couple of minutes. . . My friends and I opted for the mushroom and pepperoni pizza, with sausage added on and warmed up in the oven. The pizza was tasty, but i think it would have tasted much better had the sausage been an original topping and cooked from the beginning. it didn't have any smokey flavor that I had hoped for.. . I mean, this is a decent place to grab a 'quick' bite, if you'll call it that. We waited around 15 minutes to order and then another 5 minutes to get the warmed-up slices. I've honestly had better. Or perhaps my expectations were just too high.
I've gone here maybe 3 times now. I love the pizza! Especially the sausage and pepperoni! The cheese pizza is also very good. . I like to buy a whole pie and have it for breakfast too! It's even better the next day. A whole pie can easily feed 4-5 people. I know this because 5 dudes from New York came in and ate the whole thing! Yes, it totally reminded them of pizzerias from their home town of NYC! That says a lot! . Yeah, you can have the high end stuff outside of this place, but the satisfaction will be the same and the pizza will be cheaper! You'll love it! Trust me! If they added more seating, 5 stars easy!
I like to consider myself an unofficial pizza aficionado and this is one of the better places my taste buds have enjoyed. . . The slices are quite big but that doesn't stop you from having more than just one, it's is absurd to think you can't have more, you must. . . Whenever I find my self near the Cosmo, I shall make another stop, Secret Pizza will no longer be a secret for others.
I wanted to find the best pizza in Vegas.  So, the first thing I did was go on Yelp, which is how I came across Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitan. With over 1,500 reviews and counting, I knew I had to come here. The whole idea behind Secret Pizza is that there are no signs, directions or marketing for this place..... You are on your own.  I don't even think some of the staff knows where the hell this place is!  I will admit I had to cheat and search through about 20 Yelp reviews to find the exact location. So, I will not ruin half the fun, which is actually finding this place.. . Once you find Secret Pizza, you walk down a long corridor, and that's when the fun begins.  Inside is rustic, casual and very New York.  The menu is very simple and straight-forward with a retro, old-school NY Pizzeria vibe, complete with 3 vintage arcade games.. . Slices of cheese pizza will cost you $4.50 per slice, which is actually very reasonable and cheap for Vegas.  If you want to add toppings, they will run you .50 cents extra (per topping).  Beer selection is Blue Moon or Coors Light on draft, easy enough, right? Drinks are served in plastic red cups, which is pretty cool, but made me crave a game of beer pong.. . I opted for a Coke, which was pretty pricy at $4.  I don't think I have ever paid $4 for a Coke in a fast-food restaurant, but hey, this is Vegas.... Why not!  After much deliberation I had a slice of Pepperoni and a slice of their Speical, which had green peppers, roasted tomaotes, mushrooms & onions. Both slices were full of cheese, flavorful, piping hot and had the crispiest of crusts.. . After I was done, I played a little pinball and enjoyed the rest of my time at The Cosmopolitan. Between the fun of finding Secret Pizza, the actual pizza itself and the attentive, friendly cashier, I would definitely give Secret Pizza the GURU seal of approval.
The BEST pizza I have ever had... and I was not drunk!   No sitting. You just wait in line and pick from the available slices. Sprinkle your own slice with parmesan if you'd like and walk out eating your pizza outside. Nice that it is open really late ( 4-5 am) . seems like a non casual crowd for the surprising casual , quick business. The patrons did not fit the restaurant. Yuppie types and high price hooker looking girls that will Probably  go back to the room and barf it up..... so if your just casual in your jeans or you dress like a freak you could be out of place on a Saturday night. Love the walls decorated with records while you wait. I think it was all Italian musicians.
Holy hell, can I live in here and just eat their pizza all of the time?! My man and I were visiting his family over Christmas and he took me here one of the days we got to be "tourists". I didn't even know this place existed but I am so glad he showed me. This is the best pizza I have ever had in my life, and I LOVE pizza. I actually got a slice of the white pie and one of the salads. The pizza, oh man. I don't even think I can find the right words to really describe to someone just how amazing it is. It is something you need to try for yourself and you will NOT be disappointed. I promise. The salad that they provided me with was also, nothing short of AMAZING. It just was a little salad in a plastic container, but it was so good! They had all the yummy toppings and the dressing was yummy as well. I love this place. I can't wait to be back in Vegas just so I can go back here and get my fix. My guy got the pepperoni and he loved it. He had also been here before and couldn't even really explain to me how good it was just that "it's the best pizza you'll ever have in your life".....and he was right! Can't wait to be back here. I love that this place has no name and truly lives up to the hype of being "secret pizza". It is so great and makes it that much more fun to get a slice of pie here.
Expect more out of this place. It is pretty secret. No signage or anything. Just a narrow hallway filled with photos. . . A whole pizza is $27 with one topping. Something like that. There's like four stools inside to eat at so most people were in the lounging area eating like my friends and I were. . . We got two whole pizzas which took 40mins. D: Hungry hippos. The counter lady seemed totally pissed off and pretty much ignored us when we asked about our pizza. It was only 8:30, no drunkies to ruin her night yet. :x . . Pizza was just ok to me. Not a lot of flavor in the mushroom and cheese.
Went here for the 1st time the other day off of a recommendation from a friend (who claimed that the pizza was amazing).  Got a slice of meat lovers and was pretty disappointed. Mostly blah, boring, greasy, and flavorless. My friend got the white slice and he agreed. The staff was mostly rude and blamed their rudeness on "the waitress called in sick today". Please... give me a break. I've had a lot of good pizza in my day and this place absolutely did not measure up to my expectations. I honestly don't know how anyone else could muster up a 5/5 review.  I most likely won't be coming back.
It's A-OK.  Not worth all the hype.
BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD. Words cannot describe it; you have to try it for yourself!. . I recommend it for all tourists, especially students, because it's definitely affordable and really delicious. Approximately $6.00 total for a slice may sound expensive, but would you rather be spending +$20 somewhere else for a meal in Vegas? I think not.! It's really really close to the Marquee Dayclub/Nightclub so if you were planning to go clubbing afterwards, I'd recommend getting a pizza slice so that you aren't too hungry or full.. . The cashier recommended me the fetuccini and meatball slice, and it was really savory. Every bite was fresh and packed with flavor, and I definitely devoured it faster than the time it took for my friends to Instagram the slice.
This is the best pizza I've ever had besides in New York. The ricotta cheese and sausage and pepperoni is delicious. They also have really good crust. It's hidden between blue ribbon sushi and Jaleo in a small hallway. They're also open until 5 AM!
Great NY style pizza. I haven't tried all the pizza places in Las Vegas, yet , but so far this place is in my top 3 pizza in Vegas. I would rate them a 5, but lack of eating space is a draw back. Still worth eating here.
Um, I was sober and this was the best pizza I've ever had. Don't ask me why I was sober in Vegas, because I honestly don't know why, but this pizza was delicious. I can't even imagine how amazing it would be if I was under the influence of anything. It's decently priced, considering they do hook you up with a pretty big slice and you ARE paying Vegas prices. I have no complaints. Had it twice in our 15 hours of being there :)
