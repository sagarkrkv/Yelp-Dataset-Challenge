A friend got a room at this hotel and it was great. Enjoyed the decor and the spacious living area. Some of the restaurants were not that great but the casino and the room were great.
Wow!!! The place to be.. I was here with my hubby for my small honeymoon :) . It's gorgeous! Gondola rides, the show in the shopping area - you get to take pics with the performers :) . . Our suite had couch, coffee maker, and water. It was big and b'ful. . I always want to return to The Venetian!!
This is definitely one of my favorite place to be. Every time I visit the experience gets better each and every time. It might not be the newest hotel, but certainly one of the best.
Love this place.. If you have not stayed here while in Vegas you are missing out.. . GREAT rooms. Friendly staff. Fabulous location
Gotta love the Venetian. Although it's so expensive I've only stayed here twice, you do get what you pay for. Fantastic restaurants, great bars, beautiful rooms, high end shopping and a facility that makes your jaw drop in it's scale and detail. . . This trip was for business so I got to experience the convention areas as well. The service by the staff was amazing, especially the food service. I'm always amazed at how you can feed 10,000 convention attendees in an hour and do with without bottlenecks and serve great food to boot! Very impressive. . . This is a great resort. I'd highly recommend everyone stay here at least once.
Only in Vegas.  You can have theme hotels like the pirate themed Treasure Island, Egyptian based Luxor or The Pan Asian Mandalay Bay.  Then there is lifestyle places like Cosmopolitan or Bellagio.  Finally there are country driven properties like Paris and of course The Venetian. . The Venetian is well executed.  It has the singing gondoliers through canals in the hotel and is true to its Italian roots.  Then again, does it really matter.. . I go to a hotel for service, accessibility to food and attractions as well as decent rooms.  The Venetian excels on all fronts.  The service is good especially for a large place.  The restaurants Lavo, Cut, Tao, Bouchon are all top notch. . The rooms are all suites.  Of course the secret is walking the 1/2 mile to be in your room, but all is well when you finally arrive.  I like this place, and it seems(for the moment) to be better than any of the MGM hotels. . . Good stay, central location, good food.......Good choice
This hotel is huge! The rooms are super nice and big. Love that there are so many shops and restaurants within the hotel too.
Stayed here almost 5 different times now. All times great until today. Was told I had to pay a $75 early check in fee. Which I have never paid before and I always check in early here on weekends. But they 'waived' it to $45 instead since I 'upgraded'.... . I get to my room and there is still trash in the trash bin from the last guest, notepad with writing on it. . . Called front desk and all the offer is the maid to come up immediately. Pissed off.
About a month ago, a few girlfriends and I stayed at the Venetian hotel. Initially this was going to be a more glamorous trip for us because the Venetian is a little pricier than most but it had beautiful rooms so we were excited.. . After our first night in Vegas, we woke up and were getting to go to breakast when we realized that every single one of us that had money in the room, in our wallets or suitcases that didn't travel out of the room with us was GONE. As each of us checked our things we discovered almost $1,000 had been stolen (including the girl who only had a dollar bill in her suitcase) and 2 sets of speaker systems. On top of that this thief decided to open our mini fridge as well and take several drinks that we would later be charged for. . . Immediately proceeding this discovery we contacted the hotels loss prevention center. They came up to our room to take a report from us. Initially they seemed like they were generally concerned and wanted to help us in any way possible, but told us we would not be contacted for 2-3 business days (after we would be leaving Vegas) with the results of our claim.. . Upon hearing back from the hotel they told us that indeed our hotel had been entered during a time in the evening when we were gone. So my question to them was, how can you fix this situation? Their answer: we can do anything about it . I realize that there is a safe in the room that you can put your things into, like the hotel suggested, but no one comes to a 5 star hotel, like the Venetian and expects to be burglarized! . . I am so frustrated and let down by the way things were handled by the Venetian. After all of this was said and done and I continued to ask what the Venetian could do to better my loss of $300 worth of property, they continuously shook my calls off, left me hanging and would not help me. . . NEVER stay at this hotel if you bring nice things with you and leave them in the room apparently it is acceptable to be burglarized and have it shrugged off. I am very disappointed in the loss prevention program and safety of the rooms.  The Venetian, from my perspective is at fault for my losses incurred and I expected much better customer satisfaction.
We stayed here for seven nights in March 2014 in a luxury suite on the 30th floor overlooking the strip.. . This hotel has luxury and efficiency off to a tee, suite was excellent with 3 flat screen TV's, desk in the corner allowing direct access to the suite wi-fi and has a printer with paper and ink to print your tickets to shows and attractions which you can get cheaper by completing the bookings on-line rather than using all the "outlets" throughout the shopping areas.. . There are over thirty places to eat in this resort with the Grand Lux Cafe in the Venetian open twenty fours a day. You will not starve as the portions are huge and the prices cheaper than I expected, the Grand Lux Cafe was good for all meals throughout the day. Every restaurant we ate in I consider outstanding.. . With over 160 shops & boutiques nobody misses out on the shopping front. The casino will never disappoint whether you are a gambler or a novice with bets from 1 cent upwards.. . If you want 5 star luxury, convenience, safety, professionalism and a once in a lifetime experience then stay here, it truly is in a class of its own and we visited every hotel on the strip to compare it. Second would be the Bellagio and third the MGM Grand. Do not believe the people who say three days in Vegas is enough, we were there for nine days and saw about half if we were lucky. An adult playground that is only as expensive as you make it.. . The Venetian is definitely my favourite and is highly recommended!
I've been going to Venetian/Palazzo since 2007, It's was a wonderful hotel/resort/casino back then and it's still a wonderful hotel/resort/casino til now.. . Their "suites" which are the base rooms for their hotel offer a more spacious accommodation than most hotels you find on the strip and the best part is that their prices are typically better too.. . I has been quite a while since I last stayed at the Venetian every since my in law's purchased a couple of time shares in Vegas. So twice a year, we go and stay for a few days and I get to stop by and have dinner at the Venetian/Palazzo. This time, I had a seminar to attend and luckily, the seminar was at the Venetian. For the participants of the seminar, we had a special price of $149/night. I checked in Tuesday evening and checked out Friday afternoon. Even if the hotel room was comped by my company, I still did the $20 tip during check in. The guy was pleasant and I got an upgrade with a view, view was decent, I was facing the T.I. hotel and was placed on the 24th floor.. . Check in and check out was a breeze. No issues.. . The only reason why I did not give this a 5 star is their gym. The gym itself was showing it's age. The free weights isn't really the best kind but overall the gym is "okay", usable for someone who just need to get a quick exercise in.
They are consistently good. Clean spacious rooms well appointed. Great for business travel. Quite peaceful comfortable beds, I can't complain much.  . It would be nice to have updated technology in the rooms or at least adapters to use the latest tech. But other than that it is good. Solid experience.
Great casino hotel.  Rooms are all 'suites" with a step down living room from the bedroom. Quiet, which can be difficult to find in Vegas.  Good restaurants and shopping right at hotel. Good location on the strip too
Venetian Hotel & Casino. . Pros:. . 5-Star Hotel, Nice Large Rooms, Good Price for 5-Star.. Room types: http://www.venetian.com/accommodations.html. Large all-marble bathroom with separate bath tub & showers and water-closet.. Parking Free.. Internet Free.. There's an iPod/iPhone clock radio docking station in every room.  This dock has the older 30-pin connector, so if you have a newer iPhone 4s or 5/5c with the lightning sync connector, then you'll need an adaptor available at Walmart or Amazon.com. An extension cable would allow you to connect your iPad or iPad Mini to the dock as well.  I prefer a $15 (30-pin) Bluetooth adapter which will let you stream music through the dock speakers wirelessly.. Nice marble-topped work desk in the living room with two USB charger outlets and A/C power on desk surface.  There is printer in desk for printing your hotel invoice at checkout or your airline bording passes, etc.. Noon checkout available midweek. (11am checkout otherwise).. . Priceline guests usually get put in The Venezia Tower away from the Casino, so you don't have to walk through the smokey casino to get to your room. It's less crowed on the Venezia Tower side than in the main Venetian hotel.  No waiting for elevators - very fast.. . We saved ~$20 per night by bidding on Priceline rather than taking the negotiated single-night mid-week rate at (Priceline, Hipmunk, Kayak, or Travelocity). Saved ~$45 per night over multi-night mid-week booking by bidding on Priceline instead of direct purchase.. . Standard room has a sofa bed and can accommodate a total of 4-6 people total, depending on whether you get a king or two queen beds (plus the sofa).. . Hotel well situated on the strip directly across from the Mirage and Treasure Island hotels and within walking distance of many of the major casinos on the strip including Ceasars, the Wynn, Paris, and Bellagio.   There's a sky bridge from the Venetian over the boulevard to Treasure Island and the Mirage hotels.  It's easy to get up and down the strip by buying a day pass for the 'Deuce' double decker bus.  You can hop on and off at any location you want.  http://www.rtcsnv.com/wp-content/uploads/routes/2013/SDX(07-07-13).pdf. . The Venetian is close to the upscale Fashion Show Mall and a Tix4Tonight Half-Price show ticket booth.   . http://www.tix4tonight.com/half-price-vegas-show-tickets.html. http://www.tix4tonight.com/contact.html. . There's a Walgreens on the Venetian property in case you need supplies, snacks, juice, yogurt, sandwiches, fruit, medicins, souvieiers, or other sundries.   . http://www.yelp.com/biz/walgreens-las-vegas-2. . Lower cost food choices can be had at the food court in the 'Canal Shoppes' area if you want to avoid the upscale restaurants. . http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g45963-d146795-Reviews-The_Grand_Canal_Shoppes_at_The_Venetian-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html. . Free entertainment periodically in the 'Square' inside the 'Canal Shoppes' mall.  The Venetian gondolas are fun to watch, but a bit pricy for a two-person private ride ($75).  It's only $18 if you're willing to share your gondola with another couple.  Anyway, walking through the 'Canal Shoppes' is a very nice 'Disney-Type' experience.. . Tons of shopping in the Venetian Canal Shoppes and Palazzo malls. If that's not enough, you have the Fashion Show and Ceasars malls within a short walk. But, watch out for the 'high-pressure' Israeli make-up sales reps in the mall shops handing out free samples and make-overs. Best to avoid 'free' anywhere in the city, as you'll soon find out your wallet is a lot lighter before you ever even make it to the casinos.. . Cons:. Mandatory Resort Fee added an additional $28 / night to the pre-paid room cost.  Expect this in any hotel you stay at in Vegas.  It varies from $15 to $30 per night.. Priceline guests get put in The Venezia Tower a little farther away from the Casino. Could be a positive or negative depending on your preference.  Rooms are the same or better.  . Priceline guests most likely won't get a strip or city view room.  Expect a room with a view of the pool/garden courtyard unless you tip the front desk clerk generously upon arrival.. Receptionist at check-in will try to sell you an upgrade w/ double the room space for $100 / night more.. Venetian property hard to navigate. Three elevators needed to reach most rooms in the Venezia Tower.  Easy to loose your way in the maze of hallways and many turns if you don't have a very good sense of direction. Signs in the hotel hallways are confusing and poorly marked. . No microwave or free coffee/tea in the room. No means to heat water for either.. Bring your own drinking water to the room to save on misc. costs.  We went through about half a gallon a day in the dry weather for 2 people.. The air in Las Vegas is extremely dry. Bring lip balm, skin moisteriser, and sun screen if you plan to be outside on the strip in the bright sunlight.
Dated Gaudy old den look for the room was not what I expected. Many amenities I would expect from a old motor lodge in the middle of nowhere-ville.. Definitely Not worth the price, I'll be back at Palms place next visit.
I have been staying here lately. It's been a while i used to stay all the time but had got a bad taste in my mouth from the service I received when the Palazzo opened. These last few trips have been amazing. The service has picked back up the hotel accommodations have been wonderful. Excellent rooms with excellent views. Very clean, the beds are very comfortable. I love the couch and extra tv in the extra level room. It makes it nice for those that like to stay up late and watch tv while others can rest in the bed without the distraction.  The bathroom is huge and the tub is nice and big for those that enjoy relaxing in a nice bath. The hotel has plenty of delicious restaurants and shopping attached. They do an excellent job of making you feel like royalty here.
Average Vegas hotel. Beds are aged, In the morning between 8-10am when you want to sleep you'll hear knocking on doors and a squeaky voice saying 'housekeeping' til you want to scream. Concierge has no clue, got us tickets for re wrong night at a show.
Good place to go for a relaxing time. The suite was spacious with sunken living room and 3 flat screens-1 bedroom, 1 living room, 1 bathroom.The room was quite new and seemed unused for a smoking room. Was on the 29th floor with a partial strip view of the pool, treasure island, trump and sister Palazzo. I did like the security checking for suite cards to ensure only people who paid for the suites get through. Remote controlled blinds and curtains and have everything needed for computer use. No personal mini fridge though only the mini bar fridge which was stocked and could not move anything to accommodate own items. Food from casual like the grand luxe cafe to the fine dining of zine was wonderful and prices were fair. They have a resort fee of $28 each night for wifi access, fitness center and pool-sort of blows.
I attended a conference here.  . . The rooms are huge, the beds are reasonably comfortable. Housekeeping skipped my room entirely one day (I was in the room working during a break from 1:15 to 2:00).   Overall the property seemed a little worn & dingy.. . I'm not really a big Vegas person, and I don't see a big difference between this and most of the other resorts on the strip.  if you get a good price here, you should go for it.
This is a very late review. Came here on August 23rd 2013 stayed for 2 nights . Let me tell you the check in process was fast. Got the keys within mins. Got to our room and it was jaw dropping so spacious, luxurious, and on top of that beautiful view. I was in luv. The staff were extremely nice and restaurants below were amazing. You wont be disappointed. Price is what you pay for.
I stayed here for a whole week and loved each and everyday! You could basically stay at the hotel all week and be fine! The Pallazo is connected, so there are twice as many things to do than a normal hotel. Grand Lux Cafe is a must to eat at- the suites are gorgeous and the beds are comfortable- only con is that you can get lost very easily and to get to your room you have to go through multiple elevators! Hopefully you have a good sense of direction!
