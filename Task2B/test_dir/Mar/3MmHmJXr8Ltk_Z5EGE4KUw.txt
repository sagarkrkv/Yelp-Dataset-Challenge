Bottom line: The food was not very good and for the high prices it should have been delicious. ($41 for salmon without sides / $63 for lamb.). My advice order a steak. It will at least be good (reported the fourth guest at out table who had the filet.). . Some staffers were awesome, not our table staff who were not accommodating and seemed put out by requests.. . I had the salmon which was undercooked in the middle by a lot. I like sushi, but not combined with cooked salmon. A guest at our table had the lamb which was extremely fatty. We were warned by the waiter in a thick accent which was hard to understand because the music was so loud (I like loud music, but this was so loud I couldn't hear the person next to me at a near shout) When we asked them to turn it down, the look from the support staff at the table was poisonous.. . I asked for a large glass of water instead of the small table glass. The table "assistant", for lack of better terminology, informed me there were not larger glasses. I asked her then to please not let my glass sit empty. It did. She came over many times to fill the sparkling water ordered by another at our table but let mine go unfilled until I asked. It had been a long day at an expo without much water and it would have been a kindness to have a larger or filled glass. I should have ordered fancy water and maybe I'd have had better service.. . Ultimately I had to apologize to my boss for picking the place because he was not happy with the selections, quality, or service. It was a disappointing experience. Because of it, I didn't visit the sister restaurant for burgers the next day (which I was looking forward to trying.)
This place was okay. A little pricey for just okay though.. . The only thing memorable therewas the proscioutto (sp?) -- best proscioutto ever hands down, other than that it was all average.
### (03/05/2014) ###: . . I finally had a chance to come back to vegas and was dying for the Riserva.  They had the nearly 1 year aged NY Strip which was super flavorful and amazingly good.  The aroma and beef flavor was intense!  . . I went back the next two days and finally on the 2nd day they had the Ribeye Riserva available!  Bells and little cupids starting flying around my head.  As you can see in my pictures the 8 1/2 month aged ribeye was masterfully carved out by my table.  Every part of the ribeye was great such as the eye and the cap itself which is usually the most marbleized part and my favorite.  Out of the 3 types I had (NY Strip, porterhouse and Ribeye) the ribeye is definitely the best out of the three is probably why it's almost never available!  . . The steak was cooked perfectly the three times I went as a medium rare and topped off with some sea salt.  The last time I came here 1.5 years ago it was overcooked 2 out of 4 times.. . I usually eat it with some ketchup & mustard mixed to help cut through the flavor a bit every few bites.  Overall the service and food was incredible.  I can't wait to go again for my 4th time and final day in vegas.  Highly recommended everyone try this at least once in their life!
I am now ruined for steak for the rest of my life.  The bone-in-ribeye is out of this world good.  No other steak can live up to what happens in your mouth with the first bite of this steak.  The little cheese balls that come out as appetizersas compliments of the chef are ridiculously tasty and leave you very much wanting to sample the rest of the menu.
Just misses on all levels.. . 3 of us went there last night for a light dinner... here we go!. . 1 specialty cocktail $14, 1 Old Fashion $18 (really?). . Big Eye Tuna Crudo - great fish, but the sauce was all high notes with no balance... fail.. . Beef Cheek Ravioli w/ 25 yr. old balsamic ($31) smallish portion, good taste, but the consistency of the filling was like baby food... fail.. . We wanted to order the "80 day" (doubt it) dry aged strip steak ($70) but the waiter suggested the bone-in rib eye steak for one (he didn't mention that it was $25 more.  The steak was smallish and carved table side by a disinterested woman with her hand behind her back... never smiled or said hello. I've had much better steaks everywhere for half the price... fail.. . The smallish side of Italian Broccoli w/ Pork was totally forgettable... fail.. . I drink my coffee black w/ no sugar... I had to send it back as the beans had been burned more than Starbucks... fail.. . My brother ordered a double espresso on ice with half and half... they brought heavy cream, then claimed not to have half and half... he had to ask for milk to make his own... fail.. . My wife enjoyed her cappuccino.. . We also had a small fruit plate... meh.. . The bill? $235 plus tip.. . My wife and I got home 2 hours later and were starved... we will not be back.. . This is the second Mario restaurant we have gone to... the other one being his pizza joint in L.A. which was horrible.... no more Mario for us... maybe he should spend less time on TV and more time training his staff.
During my stay in Las Vegas, there's only a handful of restaurants that I wanted to go, Carnevino was one of them. Unfortunately, my visit came in a time where I had to give up red meat, pork, and rice for lent. Sad, I know. Why would I torture myself by going to a steakhouse for dinner? Because of the pasta they were serving. The Pasta at B&B didn't meet my dietary restrictions so off to Carnevino I go.. . Dining alone has always felt weird for me, Vegas is all about friends and family so dining alone in this big city was very alien to me but sitting at the bar for dinner and talking to the staff made it easier for me.. . As much as I wanted to eat a ribeye steak, I can't. So I ended up ordering a spaghetti frutti di mare and cannoli for dessert. . . They started off by offering an amuse bouche of Parmesan cheese ball, fried cheese ball, salty and savory. Great way to start the meal off. Then a complementary rosemary ciabatta bread with 2 spreads, butter and lardo spread. The ciabatta was baked perfectly, amazing outer crust, tasty and salty, with a super soft inner bread. My goodness, I could eat that bread all day everyday. One of the best variation of ciabatta i've ever ever tasted.. . The spaghetti frutti di mare was delicious. The base sauce was nicely balanced, slightly acidic, and had some heat to it. The seafood had 2 big prawns which was the size of langoustine, half a lobster, clams, and alot of calamari which were all cooked perfectly. The prawns and lobster were soft and succulent, the calamari were fork tender, and the clams were great. A real perfect dish. At $31, the seafood were generous.. . The cannoli were gigantic. It's meant to be shared. 2 big pieces of cannoli, and 2 ice cream with sprinkles of pistachios. Perfect dessert to finish the meal.. . During the meal, I asked if they had the famous "6 month dry aged beef", the server told me "no we don't but we do have a 10 month old dry aged beef". In my mind, 10 months!?!?! that must be one hell of a beef. For that, I want to eat that beef after April 20, 2014 which is the last day of lent.
Carnevino would be a 5 star except it's so expensive! The wine in particular was laughably priced.  It's nearly impossible to find a decent bottle under $100.  . . In our party of 8, all but 1 person loved their food.  That one had the 16 oz. NY strip and wasn't impressed.  The beef cheek ravioli with shaved truffles was outstanding but a pretty small portion for the price (over $35 I believe).  . Calamari appetizer was perfect and mashed potatoes with poached egg were too.  . . Overall, an elegant dining experience.  Although, I can't fail to mention the entrees arrived as we were still eating appetizers.
I had dinner here for the third time last week and it was awesome.  The bone-in ribeye was the best steak that I have ever eaten and the mashed potatoes were great.  This is a fun, upscale Vegas restaurant that I would definitely recommend.
The BEST steak I have ever had.  7 1/2 month aged ribeye.  Holy crap it was incredible.  That's what all beef should taste like.. . Service was incredible too.  Young guy who knew his stuff and seemed passionate about it.  He even brought me 3 digestives (gratis) to try after dinner because I was about to explode from trying to eat that massive steak.. . I've been to Prime, Mastro's, Sparks, Alexanders, etc and this is heads and shoulders above the pack.  Most steakhouses pretty much have the same stuff.  Carnevino's menu definitely changes the perception of the American steakhouse.
Best bar staff in town. Excellent mixologists and extremely knowledgeable in their craft.
the dry aged rib eye to share was delicious, but i think i liked my friend's porterhouse even better.  . . the sides are all tasty, particularly the carrots.  the octopus app was also delicious.
My son and I recently had dinner at this restaurant in the Pallazo owned by Mario Batalli and I have always wanted to eat at one of his places. We sat at the bar and had incredible service from Eric and Cooper. We asked them what the best things on the menu were and they instantly recommended the steak tartar and the grilled Octopus to start. We ordered those and they were insane...cannot believe grilled Octopus could be so tender and delicious. So then they said we need to share the bone in Sirloin which had been aged 120 days. It to was fantastic and they actually carve it off the bone for you table side. I cannot recommend this place enough but I think sitting at the bar made the difference for us as the conversation with these two bartenders was really fun
We dined at the bar, which was super, due to Dominick D. And Eric, H. By following their recommendations, we had an awesome experience. They gave us excellent service, friendly, and knowledgeable of their menu and huge wine list. The grilled octopus was outstanding! Beef cheeks ravioli,  unique,as well as the sweetbreads. Dessert of chocolate and peanut butter, and crunchy, was not sickening sweet.  Thank you Dominick and Eric, and the mgmt., for hiring such a team !
Firstly, let me say this restaurant came highly recommended. However, both the food and service disappointed. If you enjoy flavorless steaks that taste like olive oil and fat, then this is the place for you. The food is mediocre and the service was subpar. At $144 for just a steak, you expect a phenomenal steak. Save yourself $120 and go to Outback Steakhouse.
An absolute disgrace. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had in a supposed "fine" dining establishment.. . The staff was so negligent, at one point I asked our waiter if we had offended them in some way. The manager, doe eyed, and clearly out if his depth, had no clue. He just kept apologizing, saying.... . "I don't understand, this never happens". . Well, guess what.... It happened to us last night... With absolutely no attempt from management  to rectify the situation.. . Pathetic.. . So, Mr. Batali... I would suggest that you pay closer attention to how you and your investors are currently beingrepresented at Carnevino, and how easily a reputation for providing such a shameful customer experience can damage ones credibility.
Huge disappointment. We have no problem with spending $25 dollars on a glass of wine. Or $30 on an appetizer or $95 on a steak IF it is delicious and we have a fine dining experience. But the Service, Ambiance, Food and Wine  in no way demand these sort of prices. They were all below average.
