Last week I sampled the buffets at both Aria and Bellagio. I'm sure some will disagree, but after trying both, I'd opt for Aria. And I generally hate buffets.. . Variety was pretty good at both, but I thought on the whole the food at Aria was much better for just about everything. I tried a lot of different flavors, Mediterranean, Latin, Tandoori, Italian, Asian. Everything was really tasty here. Their Fish Market had some really outstanding whitefish. . . The only thing I came away a bit disappointed with was the Asian. I was really looking forward to this, but they came up short here. Generally bland dim sum, rice and stir fry. They need to do a little work on this part of the world, but even so, I think I'd go back for lunch.
We weren't sure if we wanted to try Arias Sunday Brunch when we love the Bellagio's buffet so much, but decided to try since we loved our stay at Aria.. . The Yelp's were all over the place so wasn't sure what to believe.. . Here is the real deal:. Perspective: Bellagio's brunch buffet is 5x better. Wynn is 2x better.Paris is about the same.. . Aria's was good but not even close. Less selection, less variety, not glamorous looking, etc. For example, the cheese area consisted of 2, yes, 2 kinds of cheese...Swiss and Cheddar...really??. . Granted, there was ethnic variety with Indian, Chinese, Mediterranean, etc. but it felt more like a buffet at a Marriott than Sunday brunch in Vegas.
I tought the buffet was a little pricy at first (30$ + taxes and service on for a sunday brunch), but honnestly this is one of the greatest buffet I went to. Lot of choice, great selection of meat, asian food, dessert, seafood, sandwiches breakfast items... I only wish I was more hungry when I was there! Its worth the price, plus if you have comps on your m-life card you can redeem them there.
Meh........ too expensive . . wasnt the best or worst buffet but i really wouldnt do it again
Went for the brunch and it did not exactly dazzle me.  First, no king crab legs.  Second, no oysters.  The clams were good and the dim sum was excellent but other brunch items were standard.  Our server gave us attitude at first but eventually came around after we made it clear that we noticed his negative behavior.. Overall it was a decent brunch, but given the plethora of brunch options in Vegas.  Next time i will pass.
Buffet snobs can boo and hiss all they like, I don't' care; Ilike buffets and that's that!  Unless it happens to be pretty crappy - like this one.   Holy moses - what a difference a mere six months make.  Less than a year ago this buffet would have been rated 4 stars - now it's barely worth half of that.  . . Presentation absolutely sucks.  You serve yourself out of these crazy saucepans that are all the rage now, you know, the kind grandma used to have - except the cooking is nowhere near as good.  The whole thing is clumsy and impractical - you have to keep lifting lids- placing them on the side, taking the food, replacing the lid back again and rinse and repeat over and over.  It's annoying, it's inconvenient and a great way to make sure you are so frustrated you just bypass those damned pots altogether.  Perhaps this is a sneaky trick to make us eat less - that must be it - they're looking out for our health! . . There are lots of different stations but none really wow - it's like they've tried to specialize in every kind of cuisine out there without really nailing a single one.  There are the Mediterranean and Italian sections serving the usual suspects, all average quality - nothing that truly stands out, there is Indian food which turned out to be just okay too, an Asian section, where other than noodles, not much else is worth noting, a carving station which is actually pretty good but when we asked for the cuts to be heated on the grill for a few seconds they said they couldn't because the chef had asked for the grill to be turned off - ONE HOUR BEFORE closing time!  Ridiculous.  . . In fact, while we were in the line waiting to get in, again more than an hour before closing time, someone from the kitchen actually came over and right in front of all the waiting guests, asked the hostess if they should replenish the food!  Clearly the level of professionalism at this place knows no bounds.. . For an establishment to charge so much per person and then do such a half-assed job is really disappointing.  If you do fancy a buffet in the city center area, your money is better spent at the Cosmopolitan.  .  . Two stars on the strength of the dessert and ice cream options which were admittedly great, otherwise thoroughly unimpressive. . . Okay, rant over.
My wife and I came here several years ago and loved the place.  We decided to stop by again and what a mistake it was.  The food selection was very limited.  The taste was ok.  I was anticipating to have lobster tail but apparently they did away with it.  We were disappointed.   One good thing, there was no line.  We were seated immediately on a Saturday night for dinner.
We have been to all of the buffets on the strip over time.  I will tell you that for the price and quality, this is one of the best!  Clean, fantastic quality of seafood and so many other items to choose from if you are not a seafood person.  GREAT buffet!
Used comps from MyVegas here, they are a great value for the buffets.  . . So with buffets, I like to do a wide sampling to start, which Aria was great for.  They have a stations featuring a selection of cuisines, all done well, Asian, Italian, Indian, Latin, etc.  Some really surprisingly good choices were things like the mushroom polenta, the Brussels sprouts with bacon, and the cured salami.  . . I then like the focus in on the seafood, which they have a nice variety of here.  They were grilling up mahi mahi and swordfish so I got bothof these, excellent.  Also had plenty of NZ green mussels, and the crab legs - which are pre-split for you, saving a lot of work.  . . Save room for dessert!  A huge dessert selection, loved the raspberry panna cotta and the flan the most.  Also, the have a good selection of gelato.  . . It might be expensive for a normal meal, but glad we had the MyVegas points to use on this.
This was my first experience with a Vegas buffet.  A co-worker suggested trying the Aria buffet as my first one.  They were definitely on to something.  That place is fantastic!! All you can eat gourmet food including sushi, turkey, crab legs, Indian food, stir fry, assorted meats and cheeses, dim sum and so on.  The list seems endless. All amazing food, with great spices and flavors. To accompany the great food, they offer bottomless drinks for $12.  Well worth it, if you ask me. White and red sangrias were flowing to our table.  As if that wasn't enough for you, they have an assortment of Gelato. I had to roll out of the buffet into the casino.  If you need a great buffet to hit up while gambling in Vegas, go to the Aria!
For awhile now I have been combing through all of the reviews on here about the Aria buffet and a I finally decided on my next trip to Vegas regardless of all the mediocre and negative reviews,  I would give them a chance.  I am a huge advocate for good customer service and I had read several reviews on here that rated this buffet poor in customer service.  I told the person I had the buffet with to keep in mind that this place is not known for their customer service so don't expect much.  I highly recommend giving this buffet a try. Our server was oustanding.. Her name is Catalina.  She greeted us with a smile, brought drinks and refills very quickly.  She cleared down our dirty plates in a timely fashion. She offered coffee at the end of the meal. She gave top notch service from beginning to end..         Now for the food review,  we came specifically to eat breakfast since the place we regularly used to enjoy breakfast,  the M resort,  no longer serves breakfast as a buffet.. The food was great.  They offer bacon like all places, but also turkey bacon which you don't usually see.  What I had, I enjoyed.  I had an egg white omelet with mushrooms and cheese, bacon, hash browns and some French Toast sticks. By the time I finished my plate, the buffet turned over for lunch.  They had a lot of appetizing dishes. I look forward to my next visit.
Our seats were shaking from people walking past our table next to the handicap ramp and the food wasn't the best quality. Crab legs were dry and the fruit looked like it was sitting out too Long. There are much better buffet deals in Vegas.
Can't go wrong with a free buffet. Thanks to myVegas (free app and Facebook game) I was able to get enough points for a comped lunch buffet.. . I waited far too long for them to ring me up because of computer issues -- shutting down, rebooting. I feel like there has to be a more efficient way. Then, no one seemed interested in seating me. Two women were chatting in a very intense -- and loud -- conversation while two other workers were trying to get their attention. It was awkward and definitely unprofessional on their part.. . The buffet has such variety that it's overwhelming. How about I have some Latin with a side of Chinese and Mediterranean, then feast some more on Italian. I guess I liked the variety, but nothing really stood out. . . A few highlights were the guacamole: chunky avocado and tomatoes with some kick. I was expecting it to taste store bought, but it's definitely made from scratch. The tabbouleh was also very good, and I was surprised they even had Korean kimbap rolls.. . The desserts were the best part. I indulged in the coffee ice cream (scooped by someone via a giant ice cream wheel), cheesecake and red velvet whoopie pie. It was far too much but all really good. I liked that all of their offerings were mini-sized rather than a full-sized cooke or dessert shot.. . The service was also better than I expected. Whenever I left for more food, my plate was gone by the time I came back. And even though I ordered just a water to drink, it was always refilled before the glass emptied.
Love this buffet! We have done all of them. Bellagio, Silverton, Bacchanal (excellent), Wynn, Terribles (yuck), but we always end up here time and time again. Maybe because we love the snow crab legs. So until we find another GOOD VALUE buffet, we'll keep coming back.
Best Buffet in Las Vegas!!!! I go here all of the time! They do need to make regular pumpkin pie though, they only have pecan and pumpkin mix.
Terrible.  Overpriced and the food is close to inedible.  The "eggs benedict" were a runny mess smeared on my plate. Noodles were gross.  All the food was flat and shapeless.. . It probably didn't help that I stood 30 mins in line for no apparent reason since there were plenty of empty tables in the place.
The reason this gets 4 stars is I used myvegas points to go to it and you don't have to wait in line. Love plugging a facebook game that wastes 200 hours of time for a free buffet playing it!! Actually the more I think about it, I would probably give this 4 stars even without myvegas but  I would never pay full price for this buffet .Its missing a couple of things to put it to that elite, lets gain 40lbs for the night, level.  I went here starving after golf. So I tried a lot of things!  I loved  the prime rib and cut crab legs! I enjoyed the chicken at the carving station as well.  The sushi selections were awful. The Italian station had some great meats and I loved the mushrooms. The mahi-mahi was very good. Loved the sauce it was in. I cant stand most Indian food so I avoided that area as I didn't want to curry myself away in a bag. The Asian noodles were decent. The service was very attentive. Drinks always filled and plates quickly grabbed. Overall I would definitely come again and will probably waste more time on facebook building up to another free meal!!
Been here many times I would give a 3 star but today is the worst experience ever, food tastebad, seafood not fresh, sushi without fish only veggies, no prime rib, and not many choice. I literally have nothing to eat. Very very disappointed.
I don't know what's wrong with the food, this is my second time here, 6 months ago the food they're serving is pretty good, with variety choices, but today all the meat I had is over cooked, super dry, seafood paella look like smushed rice stir with some dry up seafood, the steam clam look like clam in mud, the only good thing is the crab leg is not over cooked.  Dessert is not bad, still many choices, coffee gelato is good. Anyways very disappointing!
Went during Sunday brunch (3/30/14) the price was reasonable at 29.99 per person although alcohol was not included, had a lot of choices including crab legs, oysters & Mediterranean food on top of the typical buffet food. Our waitress was super friendly, but the cashiers need to adjust ther attitudes. Overall food was good, just stay away from the sushi.
