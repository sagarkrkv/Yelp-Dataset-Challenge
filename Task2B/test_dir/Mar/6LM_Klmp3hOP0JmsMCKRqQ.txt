The Luxor offered us a basic room in the West Tower with absolutely no view to speak of.  I was not able to get ANY connection to my cell phone, which made communicating with family in another hotel all but impossible.  They will charge you a nightly resort fee, which is incredibly annoying.  The check-in/out process was fairly easy.  The rooms could use some updating: the carpet in our room was fraying.  The bathroom was nice and spacious and there were separate tub and showers.  A huge disappointment I had was when I found out there was no coffee maker in the room and had to pay room service $12 for a single pot of so-so coffee.  I suppose I should have paid the starbucks in the Luxor the money for a better drink.  I am not sure we will be staying here during our next trip- the rooms were so-so, it is at the end of the strip, so there is a lot of walking.
The rooms gives me the creeps.. All the damn statues. We got there late and all the double beds were supposedly taken so they gave us an upgrade to a suite! Awesome right? . . Thought the room was quite spacious with bar and living room and one big king size bed but it was just so dark! I think I turned every light but it was so dim probably because all the black in the decor. In addition there was so many Egyptian type pics and statues that just look at you... It's so disturbing. . . Definitely a step up from Excalibur but I wouldn't stay here again either.
Very large and clean rooms.  The front desk staff and the dealers in the casino are the rudest I've encountered in Las Vegas, though. Price point and the great location will probably keep them in the short list for future visits, but their staff could definitely stand a little lesson on smiling, making eye contact and welcoming your guest.
The Experience:. My very first time staying in a pyramid! (and probably the only way I will ever stay in a pyriamid) Decided to give this place a shot when I received a discount offer for my birthday. We came here in January and were welcomed by a pretty long line to check in but lucky for us, it moved pretty quick. There is a Starbucks near by that you can grab a drink to do yourself a favor and get ready for the night while waiting in line. The desk clerk that helped me out was really nice and noticed that I was celebrating my birthday late. We had a nice conversation about that and the holidays. She was very helpful and even offered to upgrade my room, free of charge! That definitely was a nice gesture and gave this place a huge bonus. Made me feel very welcome and excited for my weekend stay at Luxor. As she provided me the keys for the room, she explained that it's a bit tricky at times to find your room being that there is two sides of the pyramid so make sure you are on the West or East Wing or else you might be stuck walking around lost. The desk clerk also provided me a coupon book that came with my room and the birthday deal. Unfortunately there was only one coupon I really used (Rice and Company), which wasn't a bad deal. . . The Room: We were upgraded to the Player's Deluxe room. Walking in, it is very clean, spacious and has a nice comfy love seat to chill at if you wish. The bed is comfortable, the stand alone glass door shower was also spotless and pretty spacious. There is a tub next to it. Near the bed there is a wet bar and a small mini empty fridge to keep a few drinks cold during your stay. The tv was alright, flat screen and worked decent. Great room to stay at. Noise level from the outside though does seem to travel in (from the hallways). We had a few loud morning people on one of the days but nothing that lasted too long. It did wake me up though. The only downside about this room is their Wolfgang Puck Coffee. I thought it was gonna be a great perk to have but honestly, not sure if the coffee maker wasn't working or what because it was a huge nasty mess that went down the drain. . . Casino: There is plenty of slots and tables. I was lucky enough that weekend to come back with more than I had taken. Some of the dealers are friendly while some are pretty snobby. There is a good amount of waitresses walking around and it doesn't take too long for you to get your drink. One thing that bothered me though about being downstairs in this casino were the people trying to get you to sign up for time shares and what not. If you are a couple, they will aim at you for sure! Just walk away from them and don't get sucked in with their free show offers. Once you hear the catch and you decline, they rudely turn you away.. . . Customer service: 10/10. Player's Deluxe room: 8/10. Decorations around the hotel: very neat and interesting! 10/10. Casino: 7/10. Over all: 8/10. . Wouldn't mind coming back and staying here again, especially since the service and the rooms were great. Only thing is that it is at the beg/end of the strip (depending where you're coming from) towards Mandalay Bay and THE Hotel. It is a little further than I wish it would be but at least you get a few walking steps in your day which we all need after eating a buffet.. . #45/2014
Nice place- could use a little TLC but the structure is amazing and the rooms are lovely. The staff is very helpful. One of the treats is the soap, shaped as a pyramid .
Just spent a quick night there for work - huge trade show here this week. The two and a half stars they have is about right. One of the older casinos on the strip and it shows. The wall paper in the halls is falling off in places - granted they are doing some construction remodeling, but nothing major. The place is reasonably clean.... Okay that's about the only good thing I can think of to day. 2 stars maybe 3 on agood day.
My first thought was Katy Perrys song dark horse !!!!!. . Well ... Anyway ... My bf & I stayed in vegas at lux for 4days. When I first walked in the inside architecture is just as beautiful as the outside. they have a few great shows in the lux. A food court ( go to LA subs !!!!!). The woman that checked us in was very nice. We stayed in the pyramid floor 10. The pyramids elevator was shaky( which freaked me out) but the hall & room were both very clean. You can set your own temperature in the  room. Room service, but if you put your sign on the door the lovely maids won't peep & bother. Beds are very comfortable (I think I was sleeping on a cloud) bathroom was nice & very clean with soaps. On the third day we were there... We woke to a leak in the roof of our room due to epic rain... So they moved us to floor 18 in the tower of the lux( which was a lot fancier) the elevator was smooth... Lol. Oh might I yelp about the fantasy show in the lux ;) the women were all very talented & gorgeous. They dance & show boobies, but no kitty. Also.... The casino doesn't smell like cigs (like most casinos do) it smelled as if I walked into Victorias secret. There's also a walkway escalator thingy that leads to the Excalibur from the lux inside, which I thought was pretty cool.  Anyway .... Overall ... The lux was a great experience. We'd go back.
I'd like to give the place 3+ stars because the lobby is nice, and pretty much every staff member from bartenders to housekeeping was really friendly and helpful.. . The bad news: . . The rooms are badly in need of a remodel. The air conditioning simply DOES NOT work regardless of being on the coldest setting & fan on high.. . No wireless internet. "Go downstairs to Starbucks" Really??. . The room service menus in the rooms are outdated. Housekeeping made two attempts to get us the right menu, but were obviously unaware of the change. Once we got the right menu, the food was good and was served hot.. . We tried to review our bill in response to an email from the hotel, and received a message "no data available" I then clicked on express check out hoping I'd get an approval page, and received a "you are checked out" message without ever seeing the bill.. . Every day our phone flashed a red light indicating a voice mail. The "message" was from the Luxor hustling us to go to the spa or some show or restaurant. I stopped listening after the first one. Please don't try to upsell once we're already guest. Tacky.. . Overall, the Luxor could be a nice Vegas destination. While I have little experience in lodging & hospitality industry my 25+ years of business experience tells me that a change in management should be considered. . . If you can get in cheap, and you'r not picky, this place is fine. Otherwise, go down the road a bit.
My stay was much better than I thought it would be. I was staying there for the RE/MAX convention next door at the Mandalay Bay. It was a convenient walk to the hotel next door. The staff was very friendly. The hotel shows so some signs of wear. People told me that elevators were funny and the are. They travel at an angle and the start and stop are an unusual feeling for an elevator. . The room had a very noisy bathroom fan. To watch a movie you needed to call the front desk. I waited on hold until I did not want to watch a movie anymore.. The room temperature control was not a thermometer, just a dial in the unit.. I did enjoy my stay.
What hotel doesn't have wifi?!?!? I called for wifi and they told me I had to go down to the casino for it to be free. I'm trying to check a few work emails before going out, what the heck! Room is okay, asked for a strip view and even paid extra and got a view of the towers -__-  Probably won't stay here again.
The good - Everyone was very nice. The inside was cool. . . The bad- They had no wifi - they offered a ethernet cable in the room - which did no help with my mac, iPhone, or tablet. . The room was dirty with mysterious stains on the floor, couch, and curtains. The bathroom fan didn't work. When I spoke to a manager about it, he did nothing. . . We had been transferred from a tower suite (which was clean and nice) to a pyramid suite so we could be closer to family - we were charged the same price but the room was a downgrade (to say the least). We said we didn't want to change if it was not as nice, and were told it had the same amenities. . . Coffee!!! They did not have coffee available in our room. They said it was a fire hazard, and it made me wonder about if I should plug in my flat iron. I was told if I bought a coffee pot and had it in my room it would be confiscated. One morning I thought I would have coffee brought up to us $25 for a pot of coffee - $5/ cup. So with our group it would have cost us $60 for 5 people to have coffee and it would have been an hour wait. . . Even motel 6 has wifi and coffee figured out.
Not the best casino.. . Bad location first of all.  You have to walk miles to be where the action is.. . Rooms looked like King Tut's Tomb.  Literally it looked like a tomb.  Dark and musty.  We stayed in the Pyramid part and had a slope in our room.  You leave the place with a neck cramp.. . Place smells funny.  Not bad but funny.  Like clove cigarettes that somebody sprayed with cologne.  I don't know what type of scent they were going for.  Perhaps the janitor's dead body is in the vents and he was a fan of cloves and cool water.  Who knows?  My theory is as good as any.. . IF YOU DO STAY HERE, THIS IS A HUGE TIP:. . When you walk past the counter and toward your room you will pass this little desk.  There are these people there that usually have an accent (some may not).  They ask you "how long are you in vegas" or "you want to see any shows?"  Stay away from these people.  They are located in other hotels on the strip as well (right by the entrance to the forum shops at Caesars and at the entrance to the Venetian Canal Shoppes has these scum for sure).  Do not talk to them...do not even give them the time of day.  Be rude to them if you want to.  They prey on newcomers by enticing you with a free stay etc.  What you don't know is that they "swipe your credit card to reserve your stay" and charge you for it.  Nice huh?  My first time in vegas I fell for it.  I got it taken off, but the last thing you want in vegas is an immediate charge to your card that you have to deal with.  Stay away from these people and hate these people.  They are worse than car salesmen.  I know they need to work etc.....but how about getting a real job?  I need to work too, but you don't see me working as the guy that unplugs life support at hospitals.  That would be a horrible job.  People would equate me with death.  I equate these "Vacations" people as scammers and annoyances.  They are mosquitos.  Just walk past them or you can yell back.  Either way it is good fun for everyone.  Trust me...if this is your first time in Vegas...please avoid these people.  They are looking for first-timers to scam.
I stayed in the tower deluxe suite. I loved the hotel it was clean the bathrooms were spacious and the bed was very comfortable. I just hated how everything in the food court was insanely expensive. 4 dollars for a soda no thank you.
Just got back from a 2 night stay at the Luxor (Mon & Tues). I'm happy to report that our stay A-OK. We didn't have any major issues for our 2 nights and everyone we delt with was friendly and helpful. I was dreading a long line for check in at 3pm but there were only about 10 people in front of us and we got to an agent within 5 minutes. We stayed in a pyramid 2 queen room and everything was clean and prepared for us. It's obvious it's an older room but the bed was comfy the pillows were amazing and the room had everything we needed. . . I knew the Luxor was farther down the strip and that's really the only reason we wouldn't stay here again. It took us about 30 minutes to get to he center (Bellagio, Cosmo, Cesars) of the strip by walking. The deal on the room was great and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfy room on a budget.
My husband, brother in law, 6 month old and I stayed in a 2 queen bed deluxe suite which was approximately $123 for 2 nights. It also included a $20 credit to use in the hotel's bars or restaurant. When we first checked in we were asked to pay a resort fee of about $22 a night which I kind of understand since it covers the pool usage, telephone, valet, etc. but we didn't end up using any of that. The self-park parking lot was very big and conveniently located at the back of the hotel with an easy walk way that led you right inside. I had requested a crib which never came. But I'm kind of glad it didn't because they would've charged me a rental fee of $30 a night. The room was rather clean other than a random, I'm guessing, used rag that we found in the shower. It seemed like an honest mistake from house keeping and they did come in and pick it up. A great part about the hotel is, even though it's a smoking permitted hotel, you couldn't tell because of how nice it smells inside. The only time I smelled any cigarette smoke was when this rude guy blew it right in my face while he walked by. The staff is pretty friendly and there is a lot to do inside if you wanna pay the high prices. Over all not a horrible experience but not the best either.
The Luxor was fantastic! The pool was great and the pyramid rooms were not a far walk. Be prepared to hike if you get a Tower room. The only negative I have are the windows. They were not clean and looking out of your window you just saw dirt and grime. Made it difficult to take pictures of the great views
The Luxor is a beautiful building and a great casino. It's not the biggest casino - it's rather small actually, for being on the Strip - but the dealers are extremely engaging and a lot of fun. Everyone had a great time at the tables and the dealers, pit bosses and everyone in between were enjoyable personalities. I did not stay at the Luxor so I cannot review their hotel rooms and I did not get food there either, but the casino was a tremendously enjoyable experience and I will definitely be back to game there. It is a MLife member.
I stayed at The Luxor back in October 1999.  Very cool features about this hotel....starting with the "inclinators"....which are elevators that rise at 39 deg angles inside the Main Tower which is the Pyramid.  They have a huge arcade, a King Tut's museum and all sorts of other Egyptian themed attractions.
I feel similarly with some of the 2-3 star reviews I've read-- not horrid, not great. To be honest, if the windows had been clean (in our pyramid suite) this would have bumped up a star or two. No matter how great the amenities are inside (which were very standard fyi), its hard to feel any sort of luxury when the windows are filthy disgusting and its the only way to get some light into the room. We kept our shades drawn when there was light out so I wouldn't gag while looking out. At least at night we had the lights of the Mandarin out the window, not that we were there much at night but to sleep.... . Otherwise, the staff was all friendly and accommodating. There's a little cafe/restaurant located by elevator 2 that we wished we would have found several days prior than we did... decent food at decent prices with lots of breakfast, lunch & dinner options for a quick meal without dropping a benny. . . All in all, it was fine but I probably wouldn't stay here again. Unless it was a penthouse suite in the tower.
I really liked staying at the Luxor until now. I recently stayed at the Luxor for two days and the room was dirty and it had been neglected cosmetically. The walls had dents, the wallpaper was tearing apart, the rug was sticky and to top it off the Luxor pen they provided us with had a chewed cap which they didn't replace after we called it in.
Let me Start this off with " This place is the Arm Pit of the Las Vegas Strip!" If you happen to work hard for your money and want some kind of Value for your "Hard Earned Cash" Go Else Where!    But Hey You just might Like this Trailer Park if your Cool with Prostitutes Working the Casino Area while you walk with your Girl " Is $200 for around the World a good Price?"   But Wait a minute...... Just before you thought that I was going to say something Good, They also have Pick Pockets Working right after the Chris Angel Show and that's where the Real Magic Starts....  you'll see that after you have been ripped off that they wont use the Cameras to find out who slipped their hand into your pocket stole your Wallet! ( They only use those to make sure your not Ripping them off!)   While I was at the security booth 3 other people came up with missing wallets and Bubble Gum Chick acted like it business as usual... just fill out the form Sir!  also these Scum Bag's Pick Pocket Jockey's don't even have the common courtesy to give the family jewels a jingle when they are right next to them, What this World Coming too?........  "Wallet was in the Front Pocket"   So  I would like to Sum this up  with this is a Place to Avoid Like you would a Restaurant with a F Health inspection hanging in the window, a Tropical island infested with Dengue fever, Booking a flight on Malaysia Airlines, Walking in a Minefield, Picnicking at a Gun Range, Paying Double on your Taxes, Swimming at a Alligator Farm or Walking into a Police Station in your Birthday Suit holding a Squirt Gun while screaming  at the top of your lungs that your " Sexy and you know it"  wiggle wiggle wiggle yeah!!!!. Yours Sincerely . Greg H.
The theme of this hotel is neat. The place could use some upgrades though. The room was a little worn out but decent. Good views of the mountain and strip. Getting a room in the pyramid was neat because the hallway overlooks the entire interior.
Stayed at the Luxor 4 nights and 5 days for Spring Break. The shows are great, go for the 2 for $75 special. Magic Jam and Fantasy were both awesome. Rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable. The MORE buffet is also a great deal. T&T on the second level is worth checking out. The pool is also a lot of fun. Missed 5 stars because of the dirty windows. So dirty that I couldn't take a Picture out of the window from my room.
This is a Las Vegas Strip hotel, not a regular hotel, so keep that in mind if you're visiting the strip.  The amenities that you would usually expect have to be paid for, but who stays in their room in Vegas, except to sleep (if that)?  The casino doesn't have complimentary coffee in your room because they want you to go to downstairs and order from Starbucks.  Room service is higher than other places because most people just go downstairs to get something to eat.. . As far as a place to sleep, it's not bad. For what I paid on priceline ($38 for the night plus a $20 resort fee, altogether not bad for a hotel), I was satisfied.  Parking is free and only mildly inconvenient.  I didn't have too much luggage so the walk through the casino to the front desk (about a ten minute walk) wasn't too bad.  If you're with a family, lugging bags latched onto bags with tots in tow, then that's a different story.. . If you don't feel like staying in the Bellagio or the Venetian, then a place like this is the next rung down.. . It's located right in the middle of all that's worth seeing in the strip (NY NY, Mandalay Bay).. . The main buffet is okay.  I don't particular favor buffets to begin with but for convenient eating (meaning you just need sustenance), it provides what you need.  But there are plenty of other better buffets in the adjacent hotels/casinos.  Stick to the restaurants though.. . The pool is crowded and chaotic--and not in the sexy way you see on TV commercials.  Lots of families and kids cannonballing into the pool so if you aim to recline and look calm and cool like Don Draper, try the Venetian.  The Luxor is where you lift up your sunglasses to give a sidelong glance at the overwhelmed father telling his six kids to stop running.. . But if you just need a decent, affordable room that is centrally located in the strip, if you just need a place to sleep for the few hours you'll probably devote to sleep because you'll be out and about and grubbing and clubbing in the bright bright bright lights of Vegas, then the Luxor won't fail you here.
My husband and I stayed here 4 days and 3 nights. The room was always clean and the staff was very attentive to our every need. The bars and LAX was fun and not very expensive. I absolutely loved the alcoholic slushies at Evening Call. :D Check in was easy and quick at 12:00am and the quick check out made checking out easy. I had no complaints only praises. If you are looking for a hotel that is close to the center of the strip this is not the place for you. If you want to enjoy the whole strip by walking, cab rides, or the tram this is the place for you.
Las Vegas is home to some of the very best and also the very worst hotels.   It's ridiculous the amount of luxury and pampering that is to offer if you have enough money to drop... and on the flip side it is scary/disgusting/potentially-biohazardous where you can end up if you don't.   The Luxor obviously falls somewhere in the middle of those two extremes.. . This is a great place to stay if you are looking for a basic room on the strip.  Location location location - this place has it.  It's smack dab in the middle of the action, toward the newer nicer end of the strip.   The prices for the basic rooms here are among the lowest on the strip.  It's true that in most other cities, the amount per night you are paying here would probably get you an upgraded room, but you have to remember that Vegas has a higher baseline price.  (Unless you want to wander off strip - which I DO NOT recommend from more bad/scary/unsanitary experiences than I care to admit.)    . . Be aware, the basic rooms are very basic.  There is no refrigerator, no coffee maker, and not a lot of frills.  But they are clean and comfortable.  The basic amenities are there.... TV/Shower/Bath/Closets/Drawers/Toiletries/Towels/Ice/Glasses/BEDS/table/etc.  (Honorable mention for the pyramid-shaped soap! Miniature anything makes me squeee! hehe.)   Everyone recommended staying in the Tower rooms vs. the Pyramid rooms, as they're newer and a little larger, so we did - although the novelty of the Pyramid rooms was appealing to me, I was overruled.  . . Also, the staff were attentive and friendly.  We were three needy women with lots of demands and they met them all promptly and with a smile.  Check-in was fast and easy, and the friendly woman there answered all of our questions about what to do, how to get around, etc.. . The hotel/casino itself is beautiful.    This place is a bit older and some of its shiny has worn off, but I can still appreciate it.    Helllooo it's a pyramid!  How can that NOT be cool?  And the Egyptian themed decor is stunning and beautiful.  You get a little numb to the over indulged larger than life decor after about 8 hours in Vegas, but if you airlifted this hotel and dropped it in the middle of hotel circle in San Diego, I'm certain it would be the talk of the town.. . There are a few nice bar/lounges in the casino - we found ourselves gravitating to Aurora and spending many hours there playing video poker and chatting up the bartenders.    The hotel also offers walkways to the two adjoining hotels (Excalibur & Mandalay Bay) lined with food and shopping for easy meandering from place to place.   They also offer a tram that runs back and forth between the three hotels for those who prefer to skip the walk.  (I could tell you some interesting stories from those tram rides if I were to break the Vegas Secrecy code. lol). . All in all, I really enjoyed our stay here.  Sure I've stayed in nicer/fancier hotels and I'm sure I will again, but not every time around.  When what  I want is an affordable, comfortable place to rest my head between adventures in Sin City, I will definitely be returning to the Luxor and recommend it to anyone with similar expectations.
They have $10 black jack and baccarat tables all day. However, they don't honor requests from players to convert the table to a non-smoking table even though everyone on the table are non-smokers.
I like the setting and this hotel has a lot of space very chill...
I was really surprised at how much I liked the Luxor. From reading the reviews it's not somewhere I would have picked to stay but we went with a group and this is where we ended up. The check in went really smooth. I like the option of being able to check in early, even though there is a small fee to do so. If you don't want to pay that fee you can still check in then wait until 3 to get your room which eliminates the huge lines. We were checked in within 15 minutes including standing in line. We stayed in a pyramid king room, which was plenty big enough and had a small table and two chairs plus an oversized chair. The bed was decent enough and after a day of walking around Vegas it felt great when we finally made it to bed. The bathroom and especially the shower was very nice. I did pretty well in the casino and all of the employees were very friendly and helpful. . The only negatives I found were the people constantly trying to sell you vacation packages. I don't mind being asked once but geez-you end up just being rude to them by the 10th time they try to get you. The other negative is how far down the strip it is. If you want to go down to Ceasars it's quite a walk. . Overall the room was nice and super quiet which is really important to me. I think we will definitely be back. I would like to stay in the tower next time to see how it compares.
I would actually love to give this place no stars but obviously I can't. I stayed at this hotel one time and that's all that did it for me. This hotel is randomly stupid. The slots are like whatever too. I stayed there for 3 nights. The first night I barely was in the room. The second night is where everything went down. I slept in the bed and woke up covered in blotches all over my body. They itched like crazy and I was finding myself looking for a CVS and trying to get rid of it rather than sitting by the pool having a good time. I later found out the hotel has a bed bug problem. My suitcase was on the bed half the time so I just threw the whole thing out including my clothes. I rushed to a doctor out here by my house and they said they go away on their own. I spent almost a month being tormented by it.
I was in Vegas last weekend with friends and had a great experience at The Luxor.  We stayed in the east towers which were clean and are rooms were easily  accessible. Staff was friendly and very knowledgeable about Vegas. The rooms were also a great deal which was wonderful. Would definitely stay there again next time I'm in Vegas.
Found a great deal on Kayak / Travelocity - $160 for Saturday night when every other site had it for $199 - $235, other comparable places started at $240.. So this is the biggest selling point for me, the *relatively* cheap price compared to other casinos on the strip with similar rating and amenities.  The last time I stayed for 3 nights at $48 per night.. . However this time I assumed that because it was a Saturday night and other places were expensive or sold out I was just paying a premium.  No. Hot tub in the room, huge bathroom and another room with its own window and total of two flat screen tv's, there's was a mini fridge too.. . No wifi to be found even though you pay a $20 resort fee.. . We didn't even turn on the tv however as we only used the room to sleep and use the bathroom. Oh well, great stay!
For the price luxor cant be beat. Theres many bad reviews on here about smell and bad service and stuff but my stay had none of the sort. Will definitely stay again.
On the plus side, my room was clean and in good condition and offered at a reasonable rate.  On the minus side:  The rooms take a long time to get to (towers or Pyramid); the hotel and casino are dark, smelly, stuffy, grimey, crowded, and out of date; the gym is miniscule for the size of the Hotel and it is impossible to get a workout completed when big conventions are in house--plus they offer no cooperative options with other hotels; the Pool is closed for most of the winter; the restaurants are outdated and out of touch; the Starbucks are understaffed and overwhelmed 90% of the time (30 minute wait!);  the staff is underwhelming.
I've always wanted to stay here & was not dissapointed. Beautiful hotel, first class service, I slept well. My only recommendation is to make sure you order your room online. They charge extra to make your reservations over the phone (really?) you can find good deals if you look. I didn't see any of their shows, we had other tickets.
My only other trip to Las Vegas was two summers ago and I stayed at the Wynn/Encore, so with that in mind.... . I think this review fits in with most of the rest and I felt very 'meh' about Luxor.  We paid about $80 a night for a Monday-Thursday stay which is pretty awesome considering that you usually can't find a room for under $100 on the strip.  But you definitely get what you pay for...  Very, very standard (and in need of renovation) rooms- which again, is more than okay with me because you're only in the room for a few hours between bars/casino's and the pool.  The food choices are okay, the More buffet wasn't bad for the price.  The real standout was the Pyramid Cafe, you must try the waffles or pancakes (Red Velvet pancakes?!  If you have time, check out the Titanic and Bodies exhibits, both are very cool.  The guys at the bell desk are extremely helpful too, they'll store your bags before or after check-in with no charge.  One extra side note for the "pro's"- the guest services rep who checked us in, let us have our room 3 hours early with no charge which we really did appreciate.. . Everything else about this place just lost me...  I understand the pyramid thing is pretty cool and gimmicky but after a while it gets annoying.  The floor plan of the place is very odd, the elevators are stuck deep on the corners of the place and you find yourself constantly going up and down stairs and escalators to anywhere or do anything.  One thing that made me really dislike this place though, were the "vultures" constantly on the floor trying to get my girlfriend and I to come talk to them about their newest condo ownership opportunity and give them money so they can comp us something later...  This happened more times than I can count.  I guess overall, even though we stayed there we never really felt welcome.  It's possible my previous visit set too high of a standard for a Vegas hotel...  During our next trips out to Vegas we'll be willing to spend a little more on a hotel for newer rooms and hopefully a better floor plan with no crazy salespeople.
Stayed with Luxor for one night (Monday, 3/24-Tuesday, 3/25) because I had a free deal from MyVegas (FB game). Went to baggage check-in when we got there (it was 8am in the morning and was not able to check in till 3pm). Took our bags, free of charge, but we left a tip when we got our bags later on.. . I checked in at 5. Process took pretty fast and immediately went up to our room. We had a 2 queen bed and the room looked pretty decent. I didn't expect much, since it was Luxor and a free hotel deal. There was a decent size bathroom and walking space as well.. . However, there was no WIFI :( (ehhh... it's Luxor).. . Check-out process was pretty fast. You can actually check-out from the tv in your room! Just remember that check-out is at 11AM the next day. When you check out through your room TV, just drop off the room keys by the elevator. . . BTW... 2 problems that I had: . 1) I had was the room alarm ringing at 6AM in the morning. Mind you that I DID NOT SET IT. I was super tired from clubbing the other night and had to constantly turn that thing off! -_____-. 2) It was 9AM when someone randomly opened our hotel room door when all my girls and I were still sleeping. Not sure if they knocked, but they came in anyways and said "Anyone there?" Since I DID NOT CHECK OUT yet, why is there someone coming in our room? Not even sure if it was a staff member or room mix-up with someone else...
I've stayed at the Luxor before but this time when I went the people made it very disappointing.  I had a $20 food and beverage credit as part of the Expedia deal that they told me I couldn't use.  And then they wouldn't let me charge anything to my room, even though they took my credit card at check in.  They just kept telling me I wasn't allowed even though I was never asked.  And when I checked in, they didn't review anything- amenities, coupons, etc... With me.  When I tried to ask for the credit back to my visa for the food and beverage, the manager on duty was rude and not customer friendly.  I told her I wouldn't be back and she said "ok".  What happened to the customer is always right?  What happened to courtesy and friendliness?  If you must stay at the Luxor, I caution you to ask a lot of questions, read all the fine print, and don't expect them to treat you with respect.  Very disappointing and if/when i do head back to Vegas, I will NOT be staying there (and will be telling all my friends not to stay there).  Shame on you, Luxor, for not appreciating the people who visit you.
Worst hotel I've ever stayed at in my entire life. Found blood on the sheets (before I slept in them), ripped towels, noisy at night, smelly rooms, dirty windows, no bath tub...We moved from the Wynn to the Luxor and boy oh boy was there a hugeeee difference!  Only saving grace was the friendly staff and $10 blackjack (compared to $25 at Wynn). Gym was just OK (small and several machines broken) and the pool was OK too. Would not return even if the room was free.
Stay in one of the towers!!!!! . . We stayed at Luxor (first time at Luxor ever) this past weekend. We checked in on Friday. We were supposed to have a pyramid room. It was incredibly loud between the casino and club. I asked if we could have a room that's less likely to be blasted out by music. The guy at check in was nice and helpful. He moved us to a tower room (with our permission). And I'm so glad we did. First, the tower rooms are bigger. Tub and shower. Nice, nice, nice. We were surprised given Luxor is one of the least expensive. The tower was not crowded, easy to get an elevator. Nice and quiet. We did not eat anywhere at Luxor so I can not speak to the food. But the ladies at the m-life desk were nice and helpful. The guy at check in was accommodating and beyond nice. We will for sure stay there again!!!! . . The only down side is I think a staff smoked weed in our room at some point before we checked in. I know that sounds paranoid but our room smelled heavy of pot....and I mean heavy. It was enough to damn near choke us. But the room was clean, everything in place. I think it was staff. Oh well, we slept better because of it :)
It's a great experience every time we come to Vegas.... We love this hotel, the rooms are a little dark, and the fact that we can only get wifi down stares is what sucks!!! But still love it! We seen bodies and the titanic it was very nice!
