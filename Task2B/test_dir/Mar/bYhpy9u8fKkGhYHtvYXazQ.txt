The staff is REALLY nice, and very accommodating. I want to stress that. They are great people and they'll give you some guidance on stuff to do, things to eat, etc., if you ask.. . The room is super tacky. It's Vegas, so that's okay. It's clean. My room is on the non-smoking floor but sadly still smells like people smoke here regularly. I'm sure it's an older hotel and wasn't always non-smoking, but up on the 12th floor I thought it might've been better.. . The hotel "stuff" on the ground floor includes a casino (doy), a bunch of boutiquey-style shops, and some overpriced restaurants. It's all indoors, little French-street style, with a sky-painted ceiling. There are signs everywhere so it's really difficult to get lost. One you're in you might feel trapped. It all looks pretty outdated and covered in decorative crap.. . I dunno. I think you could probably go to a better hotel for about the same price. The smoke smell was just too much for me.. . Oh yeah. $14.95 a night for Internet (one device only). Self-parking is free, though.
Stayed here for the first time! Loved this place and the workers were super friendly!   10 stars to the spa!  Everytime I come back it is a must for the spa!
We didn't stay at this hotel, but I wanted to review the Taylor Hicks 1-hour show at Napoleon's.  Really liked the venue, seated about 150 people comfortably.  We were fans of his while he was winning American Idol season 5, and my wife in particular was excited to see him in concert.  We were about 20 feet from the small stage (keyboard player, drum set, guitar & Taylor all barely fit on it) & it sounded & looked great.  Taylor played guitar & harmonica and did 8 songs, including a 10-minute version of Elvis' "In the Ghetto" - which was highlight of show for me.  Afterwards, if you bought merchandise you could get multiple photos taken with him outside of the bar, which we did.  He was very cordial & thanked us for seeing his show.  I would definitely pay to see him in concert again, he is an outstanding musician.
I have to double-up on a review here--- posted on hotels.com but not sure they're going to put it public, and I must encourage others to listen to their gut..... I read many reviews of Paris on hotels.com and the comments about cleanliness and the smoke smell are SPOT ON. Really not a great place as far as clean/updated. I was there with 2 other people for one night and we ALL got sick with respiratory illnesses which turned out to be BACTERIAL. Legionnaires comes to mind (!!!) One of our troupe actually got Rubella (german measles) from the bedding. Just a dirty hotel. Air vents are filthy. Room had old carpet with stains under furniture. Entire room had a musty/mildew smell about it. Bathrooms sub-par, just not someplace I'd return to, recommend or encourage anyone else to stay at. The view of The Strip was not worth the pricy doctor visit to get through the bacterial lung infection we got while there. Contacted their 'customer care' and got nothing. They ignored us. I wish I had not given them the benefit of the doubt...... trust the bad reviews...stay elsewhere.
Great casino, decent rooms.  Try and get a room with a view of the fountain.  . . I swear one night they had strippers dancing during a black jack deal...up on a stage.  One of them was very pretty and the other looked like my ex-girlfriend.  I was with my fiance at the time so this was super uncomfortable.  I wanted to look to see if it was my ex...which it wasn't....but at the same time I didn't want to be pervy in front of my fiance.  I failed on both counts.. . But anyway.  The casino play is decent.  Nothing really special going on as far as limits etc.  It is a Total Rewards establishment so bring your card.  They have two amazing restaurants (Mon Ami Gabi and Eiffel Tower).. . Do not...do not....buy drinks at the casino bar.  They were trying to charge me $12 per crown and coke.  That must have been crown and actual coke...as in cocaine...to charge that price.
Our 3rd stay at Paris and our last. The nightly room rate gets you nothing. The Front Desk Clerk told us that even though our room was ready we would have to pay $25 to get in before 4PM. Although....if we paid $40 to upgrade our room they would waive the Early Check In fee.  Wink wink.  We had to schlep our bags all the way outside, down the walk by the Taxi Stand to have the Bell Desk check them. THEN at 4PM we had to wait in the key pick up line, wait 30 minutes in our room for the Bellhop to bring our bags...and to add insult to injury, had to TIP the bellhop for bringing our bags. What a scam.. . Of course there is the nightly Resort Fee of $20 added on top of the nightly room rate. The Resort Fee is supposed to get you free wifi, BUT only for one device. Really? My husband and I had to choose whether his phone, my phone, his work laptop or my work laptop could get on the internet each day. Forget our iPad. If we had wanted to get all 5 of our devices on the internet, it would have cost an extra $60 each day.  We finally had to cough up an extra $15 so we could both get some work done on the 3rd day.. . This was supposed to be a vacation, not an exercise in annoyances. We decided next time we're going to a hotel that gets all our money up front and actually gives us something for it. It won'tbe a Caesar's property.
Like: The closest you can get to Paris, France in the states if you're unable to make it to Europe. Interior is nice including the rooms with a BIG bathroom with tub and shower separated. Sports betting available. Some shopping available plus food options on the ground floor. They gave us some restaurant credit, which we used for room service and for breakfast at their cafe downstairs. I've been up the Eiffel Tower, which is lovely at night to watch the Bellagio water show from up above. On the strip so it's close to everything with a taxi waiting area outside. . . Dislike: The room had a small tube TV (whatever the non flat screen tv is called) AND it was off to the side so it wasn't in line of sight when in bed (which is how most people in their hotel room end up watching TV). Small fridge wasn't that cold of a temperature. Toilet is in line of sight of the mirror on the back of the door, which can be a little weird watching yourself on the toilet haha.
I'm not a Diamond high roller, but I am also not the new Vegas tourist who fell off the turnip truck.  I maintain a higher level of casino play here, to where I get free rooms, free food, and other comps that some people may not get.. . According to Caesars Entertainment, the people who own Paris,  the hotel Paris is considered more upscale than the other properties ( Flamingo, Ballys, Rio, Quad, Planet Hollywood, Harrahs) with the exception of Caesars Palace...  Yet, the past 2 times I've stayed at this property as a "comp" I get treated more shabby than the other properties.  Their front desk people who work the Platinum desk must be the punished ones... they don't get the Diamond / 7Stars desk, so they're demoted to help low rollers like me.. . 3 months ago, when I called to booked my room, I was transferred to a special VIP Marketing Department to take care of my free room.  WIth the 2 nights free room I also received free money to play on the slots.  The person booked me the "Red Luxury" room and told me that I'd be getting one of the nicer rooms in the HIGHER floors of the hotel.  He kept gushing how much fun I would be having.  . . Fast forward to the arrival date.. . When I arrived to check in,  this older lady who couldn't even smile asked me a string of questions like "smoking?" "King or queen?" which I replied Non Smoking, King, and a higher room with a view please.  She replied "Of course", and then promptly tried to give me the FIFTH floor, smoking.  WTF!?!   . . 5th floor is only 1 story higher than the ground level.  It wasn't a view of the pool, it was the pool!. . I handed her back the key and said I'd like a higher room, please, non smoking, and with a view.  I also asked her if it was a Red Room and she replied "No, its a request only, and  comp rooms are only by request.  So, you got a classic room".  . . Come on, you couldn't even LOOK to see if I could get a nicer room?  . . Apparently anything I said, she gave me the opposite.  If I said blue, she'd say green.   I told her that I'd wait for a nicer room, and she said come back at 4.. . The Classic room was "Just OK".  It was on the 12th floor (Room 1223) and it did face the Paris ball, overlooking the pool.  The room, however, smelled strongly of cleaning detergent, like they just shampooed it.  For a free room, it did the job.. . I get it that I got the room for free, but I didn't like how the front desk treated me, like I don't deserve VIP treatment.  I dump a lot of money at their property (and it shows, since I'm bombarded by free offers every single week!) and yet Paris is the worse hotel when it comes to front desk courtesy.. . In December I was in Flamingo, and they gave me a stunning 24th floor room with a magnificent view.  The rooms were actually nicer than the "Classic" Paris room I got, and location on the Strip was just as nice.  Even Ballys once gave me a corner suite, and I didn't even ask to be upgraded.. . What gives, Paris?? Is recycling $20K not enough?  I guess not.
Here on a conference, so I had no choice where to stay.  The hotel is EXTREMELY DATED.  It is dark and melancholy.  The casino floor is depressing, dingy.  The food is poor.  I wanted a King bed instead of two Queens and they said they did not have any unless I wanted to pay an extra $20 per night.  Huh?  Also, I arrived at 2pm and they charged a $15 fee for early check-in.. . The room, although non-smoking, smells stale.  There is a rather ugly oversized wardrobe in the middle of the room and the tv is off to the side rendering it virtually un-viewable from the bed on the other side of the room.  I have an unpleasant view of a concrete parking structure outside my window.  I will NEVER stay here again.  Wish I was at the Bellagio across the street.
This was my first place to gamble, and I was in awe - here's why:. . The roof is painted like the sky at dusk, which is pretty cool.. The games are fun and typical of all of the other casinos on the strip,. The place is lit such that you have zero clue as to what time of day or night it is... kinda crazy.. . Overall, interesting and just what I expected of Las Vegas.
I'm not a high roller, but I spend a lot of time and MONEY in Vegas.  I stay at a couple of casinos all of the time but my wife said we should give Paris a try. . . We booked our room well in advance for one king size bed. When we checked in just after 4:00 PM on a Tuesday afternoon the "Cranky Lady" at the front desk almost made me turn away and go to my usual hangout. There were no rooms available at that time with a king bed, when I asked when one will be ready she told me 2 - 3 hours. I asked why and she said "I don't work in housekeeping so I have no clue why". At my business that would be an immediate escort to the front door with a loud "YOU ARE FIRED" She needs to learn how to smile and treat customers with respect. We took a room with two queens so we did not have to wait.. . The room was "Just OK" 4 out of 10.  The room, however, smelled strongly of cleaning detergent, the toilet would not stop running and there was mold in the bathroom. This place needs a serious upgrade.. . Here's what I say, First Impressions are a must and the front desk here FAILED!!!!! I spend a lot of money in Vegas and going forward it won't be at this place.. . Paris needs to get their act together.
My review is solely on the room and decor of the hotel, as we did not eat here. We stayed here for my bachelorette party weekend and it was amazingly beautiful! Love the French village inside! Pool has great view of Eiffel Tower! The hotel lobby is gorgeous with giant chandeliers. It was nice having the Eiffel Tower as a beacon of where to head in the wee hours of the morning when we were stumbling home ;) Sure there are even more beautiful and luxurioushotels on the strip, but for the price and the fun we had while at the hotel I thoroughly enjoyed it.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Paris on Wednesday and Thursday night.  Unfortunately, on Friday night (March 21, 2014), the bass coming from the music at the Chateau Nightclub near the casino was so loud that we couldn't sleep.  I could understand if my room was near the night club, but we were staying no where near the club, across the casino, on the 11th floor.  Room 1101.  We had a great view of the tower and the pool, and could see a little of the Bellagio fountains. But.....if you want to sleep, I would not recommend staying in room 1101 on a night when the night club is open.  The music goes until 4am.  We could hear the bass loud and clear, and it was impossible to sleep.  I guess Paris really values this night club.  More so than their hotel guests.  I won't be staying here again.
I stayed here one night with a friend recently during the March Madness festivities. The location on the strip is great and overall is a nice hotel. The walk to the elevator and then to our room was a bit of a trek, but not too bad. I'm not sure what my friend paid or booked, but it was a double bed room and had a nice separate shower/ bath tub combo. The view was the backside of the strip so not much to look at. . . I had wanted to go to the pool the first day we were there but we had to wait until noon for it to open which was annoying. We waited in the bar outside the elevates and they had $9 mimosa & Bloody Mary specials so not all was lost. We ended up just doing a lap around the pool deck and not staying as the pool was nothing special. . . My biggest complaint was that the helpful old security guard gave me unsolicited directions which ended up having me walk an extra mile through the Bally's construction zone just trying to get back to the strip after he told me about "a great short cut". Never again Wyatt, never again...
It was time for an annual concert that my wife and I attend and this year it was held at the cosmopolitan. This year we decided to go across the street to Paris which in retrospect turned out to be our first bad decision. Now the hotel in itself is nice; lower scale models of actual french architecture and statues, beautifully decorated ceiling and delicious restaurants. It was all enjoyable to gaze up at. That is until you begin to interact with the hotel and staff. For starters, as we checked in, the front desk staff informed me that my card wouldn't be charged until check-out which turned out to be a complete and blatant lie. "Trusting the staff", second big mistake. Fortunately this grossly misleading piece of info didn't affect my weekend but others with a tighter budget may not be so lucky (fair warning to others with future plans). . Moving forward, as it turns out our room was built for 1 shower a day... I say that because it seemed that the water got hotter by the minute with no way of cooling it down no matter which way you turn the crank. When brought to their attention all they did was attempt to give me a shower-taking crash course and according to the staff I was incapable of understanding the dynamics of shower taking because this problem is "highly uncommon" as it was so delicately explained to me. In the end, we got nowhere.. Now, normally, when we stay at a hotel we like to gamble there to enjoy part of the experience. "Giving money to the place that is so far kicking my weekend around", third big mistake. Aside from a prize 2 or 3 dealers the floor staff was inattentive, unresponsive and just plain rude. Its no fun to gamble or give away hard earned cash while your trying to order drinks and all the meanwhile getting nothing but scowls and sneers through some judging eyes. It makes for an uncomfortable playing environment. Needless to say the last half of our weekend was spent elsewhere.  . . As I read the first sentence of this review, looking back that we haven't stayed at THAT hotel makes this reviewer realize his biggest mistake of all. Perhaps one of those scalding hot showers will wash or burn away some of these dreadful memories.
So I stayed out at Paris during St.Patrick's weekend to catch the flogging molly concert. I've stayed there multiple time without ever having an issue which is why I always come back...that is until this trip. I've never had an issue with rooms but when I checked in this time I noticed that the sheets were dirty. The room smelled like smoke even though I requested a non smoking room. And the most painful, and I mean that in the literal sense, was taking a shower. For some reason there was no cold water running in the room so my back got burned pretty bad. I'm never one to complain about things, especially when I've had great experiences in the past, but honestly this has really put a damper on my decision to stay there again in September.
My opinions and experiences when it comes to Paris are very mixed. But the commonality among all experiences is that Paris is vastly overpriced.. . The Good: I was working in Vegas for a while and stayed in the base room once or twice which I expected to be roughly equivalent to one of the nicer rooms at Flamingo. The decor was nice but nothing impressive, however the room was huge! Absolutely enormous - had a hallway into the bed area, then a hallway with closet and desk space leading to an enormous bathroom with a fantastic shower. . . The Bad: Spent a weekend at Paris with the gf and thought it'd be nice to upgrade to one of the higher end rooms - not the top class suite but the next highest. The Red Rooms as I recall. The room was a dump. It was tiny, the decor was no different than the base room. The bathroom was the size of a Motel 6 bathroom. And I paid more for this?! Are you kidding?!. Plus, all Caesars hotels started charging a mandatory $20 resort fee which covers the pool and health center. Hello? Maybe I don't want to use those amenities and would rather keep my $20. Why try to gouge me out of more money when you're already overcharging for this tiny room?. . My advice: pay a bit less and stay at Planet Hollywood. far more modern, much larger and higher quality rooms and cheaper. . Or pay a LOT less and stay at Ballys/Flamingo.
Pleasantly nice stay at Paris after our original hotel was booked full for our conference. I didn't have the best interactions with the front desk however. I wanted to check in 20 minutes early and was told I'd get charged early check-in (I asked, thankfully). Then, even though I had our reservation that said check-in was at 3, the woman insisted it's at 4.. . Thankfully, the manager was standing right there and let me in early. I was willing to wait however long it took. I wasn't going to give them any more money especially with the ridiculous resort fee tacked on.. . Anyway, the room was pretty spacious, although I opened the center cabinet thinking that the TV would be there but nope, just a big mini-fridge. The channels were weird because the first five were Chinese-language channels, then Spanish-language channels.. . The bathroom was quite spacious -- the best part. Big sink that allowed my roommate and I to each take a side of the counterspace. Separate shower and giant bathtub. Full-length mirror.. . The housekeeping staff were extremely friendly. Every time I passed them in the hall, they would greet me hello. . . Didn't use the Internet myself because only one device is allowed, which they pointed out during check-in. My roommate said the connection was spotty at times.. . Didn't have any issues regarding the room so it was a comfortable stay for three nights.
Okay hotel, nothing remarkable about this hotel. It is obviously thematic, and if you're in for cheesy victorian decor, you'll love it. The room was clean, service was average. Again, nothing remarkable.
Booked a nice room for the four of my friends and myself with two queen beds. The room itself was very beautiful and organized. This room had all of the necessities to ensure its customers that they will have an amazing stay at Paris Hotel. It had a security deposit box to put your valuables in, a big plasma screen TV for when you need to rest, hangers to hang your clothes, etc. I thought the bathroom was super cute because the shower and bathtub had beautiful calligraphy on it, which definitely added a "French" touch to the Paris Hotel altogether. Appearance and atmosphere, 5/5.. . Also, Paris is located in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip, which is a GREAT location for tourists. Basically, you're right smack dab in the middle of the city and can choose to go either left or right from when you wake up to explore Las Vegas. No need to walk too far to get anywhere since we're in one of the best spots. . . But what's not so great about Paris? Their service. I don't know what reason, but every time we left the hotel, we'd come back to our un-made bedsheets, used towels, and empty shampoo/conditioner bottles. It's like housekeeping didn't even do their job! We actually had to do their job for them and CALL the front desk every single day to request extra towels and shampoo/conditioners. Then they'd take about 20-30 minutes to bring up our supplies, which really puts a damper on our vacation as we have to take vacation time out of our day to do the work they were supposed to do in the first place.. . But it's okay, we left them a present. A giant heap of 15-20 used shower towels on the floor of the bathroom because somebody didn't clean them up when they were supposed to.. . Otherwise, I'd still recommend this place to stay. Great location, great appearance, great atmosphere. Maybe we just weren't so lucky, but hopefully others will be.
