This show was awesome! The stage was so unique along with the characters and outfits. It is a martial arts based performance with a love story woven in. I really enjoyed the pyrotechnics. We were able to get nice seats in the middle with a great view for very reasonable prices for a cirque du soliel show.
I fell asleep..... Seriously where's my refund!!!! We went to zarkana at aria last summer and loved it..this was a sad excuse for a cirque du soleil show...very difficult to follow and now we get to watch a video instead of the last scene of the show? Felt like my senior project... The staff members were very rude...Glad we got the winter deal I would never pay over $50 for this show....I feel sorry for the ones that did...only 2 people gave a standing ovation what does that tell you?
Saw this show the other day and wasn't very impressed since we've seen a few other cirque shows before. I get they had to tweak it up a bit because of the accident, but I think it just made the show a lil dull. There were some pretty cool stunts done.but you can tell which scenes had to be tweaked. The last battle scene would of been amazing. Kind of wish we saved our money though. All in all it was okay n still 100X better than chris angels show.
This was my third time seeing KA - mostly because family members wanted to see it - but once is plenty. Like all Cirque shows, it is heavy on costume, and they are terrific here. The performers are all very talented, but KA differs from the other shows in that it 'tells a story.' Good guys vs bad guys - Gee, guess who wins..... . For all Cirque shows, I want to yell, "Do a flip!", but there are no flips here. There are brilliant costumes, dances, acting, and props, and it will mesmerize you. And it is a top production, but I don't come to the Cirque shows looking for a story. See "O" and Mystere first.. Visited December 2013
Had high expectations going in, and the stage and theater were really cool, but the final video scene that seemed to go on forever ruined it for me. If the performers don't want to (understandingly) do it, then they either need to replace that scene or just cut it all together. A video won't be missed, and it doesn't belong in such a production.
Great show. Amazing stage set up. Love the actors in the begining. Acrobats were awesome!
This show was absolutely incredible. From the pyrotechnics, to the martial arts, to the acrobatics and acting, this is an experience I would recommend for anyone wanting to see a stunning show. We sat very close to the front, which enabled us to feel every burst of fire that came from the stage. Would definitely see it again.
This is my 2nd time watching KA. They replaced the epic top-down action sequence with a poorly rendered CG recording. Was a bit disappointed in that.  Must say beginning was more impressive than the end but still carries the most engaging storyline in Cirque du Soleil in my opinion.
So in February, I saw the traveling cirque show in LA called Totem and thought it great, some friends told me that if i enjoyed that i should check out the Vegas shows because they are so much greater, with even more dardevil acts and the permanent sets allowed for more incredible feats.. . That being said, this show was terrible. $160 a head for high school marching band baton twirling, amateur fake sword fighting, and slapping plastic spears on the floor. The best part of this s&#tastically drool enducing boring show was the 30 seconds of fireworks at the end. And the actual end when i couls get the *&#k out. AVOID THIS SHOW AT ALL COSTS.
We loved the show, plain and simple. We were sitting in the last row, dead center, and that was not a bad spot at all. . . I have seen 3 or 4 shows by Cirque du Soleil and I have to say it is the first time I can actually follow the story 100% haha. The show is not all about stunts and impressive/dangerous stuff, there is also a lot of martial arts choregraphies and story telling, which I really enjoyed. . . It is simply the most beautiful show I have ever seen. The lights, the decor, the stage, all of it was perfect. The way everything is set really makes you feel like you are inside the story. If you want to see fire and explosions and stunts and stuff, the show might not be for you, but if you enjoy visually amazing art, I would definitely recommand it!
The arena is very cool and everything is up to par with the high Cirque du Doleil standards.. . We heard that you should read the plot beforehand, so spent 15 minutes reading it on Wikipedia on our phones as we waited for the show to start. I'm glad I did this, because it made it easier to understand what was going on.. . This is a great show and am glad we went. My only issue was with the final battle scene.. . In case you don't know the history, a performer died after falling during this scene, and the show wasmodified afterward. I have no problem with them doing this, but the way they did it was just disappointing. They projected imagery of the final battle scene, with digital actors doing acrobatics. The projection was blurry and just not engaging. I felt like we were watching a movie in a cheap movie theater. They could have done better.. . Other than this, Ka is still a great show.
1-1/2 hr of WOWs! This show has a story line, fascinating stuns, hand shadow, and very realistic 4D staging and backgrounds. . . I am the type to notice wires and always coming up with explanation on how they do stuns or how they do the background but some scenes and background changes left me speechless and impressed.. . I love the boat and drowning scene! . . I noticed that the seats were installed with its individual soundbox, some scenes they use it but you won't notice it unless u turn your ear to the seat.. . I got my ticket $55+ fee+ tax for great seating in the second mid section. . . Parking was free because I parked across from mgm at tropicana hotel. Very convenient. . . -1 star because I felt the story line was a bit rushed at the end and some parts didn't make sense. In addition. Some stuns were similar in many of the cirque du solei shows
My expectations were high because of a traveling Cirque show I saw about 8 years ago. I was anticipating more acrobatics and wow and less of a plotline to follow. Could have been my fault for not knowing completely what I was getting into this time around. Still a great show with enthusiastic and talented people!
I went to see KA as my first Cirque Du Soleil Show over the weekend.  I chose Ka after talking to everyone who has seen it tell me the show was amazing. However, what I failed to realize was that all the people I talked to watched KA "pre tragedy" which was prior to June 2013.. . Halfway through the show, I was extremely impressed with the layout, costumes, performances and the stage set up. I can't imagine the amount of planning and design that went into designing the theater.  I was ready to give the show 4-5 stars until...the CGI/projected fight scene. It was blurry as hell and I couldn't figure out what was going on.  It was such a disappointment seeing that and unfortunately I let that ruin the entire show for me.  I wish they would have just left that out because it really didn't flow.  They should either remove that entirely (or if they are going to show it for the stories sake, make it shorter) or just choreograph something else with the actual performers. . . I'd recommend watching KA only at a discounted price, if you get free tickets or if you can look past the digital fight scene. Otherwise it's an amazing show.
This was an amazing show!  The music was cool and the acrobatics and acting were great.  The moving stage is out of this world and is one of the coolest things I've ever seen in a theater setting.  The show is pricey but if you check their website or call the MGM Grand box office, you can typically find deals/specials.
The Ka theater is worth the ticket price alone. The detail of the sets and theater is astounding. Towards the end, the show started to drag and the projected fight scene was unneeded and a bit cheesy.
I Hated it!  I felt the baton throwing and staged fighting was very boring.
While waiting for the doors to open we were entertained by greeters and ushers with their enthusiasm and lively disposition.  It sort of set some expectations on how the show will be.  Unfortunately, that energy did not flow into the type of performance we anticipated.  I certainly expected more from cirque du soleil.  We had difficulty following the story line. Some scenes were just too long and lagged. On the other hand some scenes were good.
I purchased tickets from Living Social. We sat in section 202 - center stage. . . I wasn't impressed with the show. Honestly, I was bored throughout the show and looking at my clock to see how much longer we had until closing. . . The transitions from scene to scene was really slow. They look a long time to get to the point. . . The use of digital art was cool but not downright intriguing. The story line was hard to understand. . . Id spend my money to go see Le Reve or even pay less to go see the Variety Show. You'll be a lot more entertained.
Really enjoyed the show, which begins as you enter the lobby - the ushers are 100% invested in immersing audience members into the experience before you even see the set - and the theatre is incredible!. . Would have given it 5 stars had the story been easier to follow and if the fight sequence towards the end weren't a video projection on the stage. I understand their need to alter the staging but for $100 a pop, this crucial point in the story simply cannot be phoned-in and expected to be "okay" with theatre goers.
I had really high expectations for this show. I heard that all Cirque shows are amazing so I was really excited to get the chance to see one. When you walk inside, the theatre is mind blowing. Nines stories tall where performers will propel down the sides to begin the show!. . The premise of the show is about a brother and sister in the ancient empire. That's pretty much all I could tell you because the story line was so difficult to follow. Read the background before hand it'll help a lot. . . The actual action that you expect from a cirque performance was really awesome! Although I felt like there wasn't enough of it, there were parts that moved way to slow when I wanted to see the action and stunts that cirque is known for. . . I am glad I went and I would see another Cirque show but it certainly won't be this one
Pretty disappointed. We saw le reve and it was better. Heard that the final scene had a mishap in 2013, so they will not be resuming that scene until 2016? Which should of been a big finale, was a real downer this time. Wish we knew before we paid like 300$ for it.
