This parking structure is the worst in Las Vegas.  Sitting in the same place for 30 minutes is ridiculous. They need to get help when big events are going on.
This hotel is fancy etc, but not really that great.. I gave it two stars because we stayed at the west wing, and other things. At check in it seemed like my husband and I were a nuisance to the gentleman who checked us in. The surprising $200 security deposit was ridiculous, but hopefully they give us our money back tomorrow when we check out, and payed a $28 a day resort fee. The resort fee we knew about, and security deposit we didn't know was going to be so high. The hotel room was nice, modern. I didn't enjoy the bathroom too much because it's see through hazy green glass walls with little privacy, which isn't a big deal to couples. The wifi and cellreception is TERRIBLE. Couldn't log in wifi with any device. I made phone calls and had to stay in one little corner of the room  because if I wal ked any where else my call would drop. The hotel itself just too big. Yea pretty much all hotels have a walk to the rooms, but this was just ridiculous. The shops and some restaurants were just okay. I recommend NOT to stay here if there is a major event like a concert if you're not seeing it yourself because t the place is too crowded and it's difficult to get to you room..  We have stayed at a few hotels here on the strip before, and this place just wasn't our cup of tea. We just had better service and experiences else where. Maybe it might of been different if we had gotten a better room or just stayed some where else. Too bad they don't have the lions anymore either.
There are only two good things about staying at the MGM Grand hotel in Vegas. The location and the bed. First of all the super gay employee who checked us in had an attitude when he told us there was a $200 fee to check in and we only had cash. I had no idea of the fee to begin with. Then we were never able to log in with their WiFi connection. Super complicated and it never worked not even offline my phone couldnt connect. I dont know if they have a signal jammer or what. The walk to the room was half a mile. I guess we made the mistake of staying when that loser miley cyrus was booked so the hotel and the parking lot was jam packed with the fall of americas future clogging up the hallways, elevators and parking garage. Spent over $500 for a 3 night stay which was really worth maybe $200. Im Definitely choosing a better place next year.
How one bad incident can change a f review to a 1 star. Enjoyed our stay until the last night. On that night we were off resort and were retuning and we unfortunate to return after a concert ended. We got caught up on traffic for 20 minutes or so to travel two blocks. When we finally reaches the entrance to the hotel they would not allow us to enter main entrance to hotel. Circle block to another 15 min later get  but can not get to valet parking. Valet will not allow us into area. He suggest going to east valet parking. Circle esprit again. 20 min later get to east valet parking and it is ropes of no valet. Finally park in garage after 1 hour of just try to get into resort. Call to talk to manager. She says there is nothing she can do about traffic. Let's see MGM concert caused traffic issue. MGM security was. Directing traffic. MGM security would not allow cars to turn into resort. Seems to me like MGM was in control and choose a terrible solution.  Not to allow guests to enter resort. Manager offered us a late check out since our flight was at 6 am that was of little help and why we were trying to return a little early. We did make it to our rooms a 1am. Do not plan to come back to resort again
This 5 star review goes to the front desk agent Jessica who spent over an hour with my friend and I regarding issues we had with the rooms we were given. The main issue was that the first person who checked us in did not ask if we wanted a smoking room or not (which was a pretty big issue for my group). We called down to see if they could switch us from a nonsmoking to a smoking room to be told that it wasn't possible since they only have 2 floors throughout the hotel that allow smoking ( besides the lobby) , second issue was the promotion we booked 'guaranteed' us a strip view the view we were given was of a dirt lot .. not cool. Jessica told us that she could switch our rooms to smoking rooms the next day, but if we wanted a smoking room that day she could put us into a skyline marquee suite for $600 extra for our whole stay plus a $600 deposit. The price was a little much for us so we asked if she could maybe take 300 off .. about ten minutes later she came back and to our surprise she was able to give us the price we wanted ! SCORE! we also got a free bottle of champagne and 6 buffet passes to use on any day we pleased. The suite was marvelous ; 2 bedroom, 2 bath, a pool table, wet bar, full living room, and a dining area. Our trip started out a little rough but it was a blast after we got into our suite ! . . There's definitely a convince factor at this hotel as well.. which was nice since we didn't have to cab everywhere around the strip just to get a bite to eat or entertainment. MGM definitely exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be back this year.
We stayed at the MGM during a visit to Vegas because we got an amazing deal on one of their new King rooms.  Check in was long, a ton of people in line, which was to be expected based on previous reviews.  We had to wait a bit for our room because they were updated the tv on the floor.  Once we were ok'ed to go to our room we said everything should be done in our room.  Well unfortunately it wasn't.  We had to call to the front desk because the room door was open and no one was around.  They quickly came in, fixed what they needed to and they have us a $50 food/beverage credit.  Great customer service.  After that everything was great.  The room was huge and clean and the view of the stir was a nice bonus.  I would definitely stay here again, they're constantly offering special deals.
Bit outdated but pretty awesome hotel for the price, the sushi place they have there is super good and the service is great.
On 3/6/2014 afternoon three of us went to the MGM to buy one extra  ticket for the Canelo vs Angulo fight and a young Asian woman at the ticket counter was very dishonest and lied about the price of the tickets available. She kept stating and insisting that there were only $400.00 tickets available when another employee and was able to find tickets for $200.00. Then she lied again stating that her computer was not refreshed. We understand that is a business but there is no reason to make a dishonest business. I imagine that the MGM did not build their great reputation in this matter and it is unfortunate that they have such a dishonest employee working for them. I hope that the administration is able to address this issue and she is delegated to a more suitable position for her. We were lucky that an honest man came around and we were able to buy the lower price ticket.
This review is for the Beachers Mad House show in the MGM specifically. I did not stay in this hotel, but while in Vegas for a friends birthday, we got tickets to the Saturday night "performance." (Beachers is somewhere between a club and a carnival side show complete with midgets, a DJ and the requisite cocktail servers busting out of their corsets). There were 10 of us in the group so at $89/each we ended up spending $1K just on tickets. That doesn't include any alcohol and come to find out, does not in fact guarantee a seat. You are basically paying about hundred bucks just for a spot in line. After waiting for half an hour or so, we were approached (in the restroom no less) by a Mad House sales rep offering us a table and bottle service. Since it was a special occasion and we wanted to be sure our friend had a great night, my boyfriend picked up the tab. Two bottle minimum which included mixers and a booth at the very back of the theater, for $1500.  All of that was fine (of course it's a rip off, we expected that), until about an hour into the evening when one of the girls in our group left to use the restroom.  Upon trying to re-enter she was told by the bouncer that she wasn't allowed back in--no explanation given. When she insisted that she be allowed back in to get her belongings and let the rest of us know where she was, she was very rudely told that she was out of luck and that she had been cut off and would not be allowed back in, even to gather her purse and jacket. Noticing shed been gone for quite a long time, my boyfriend, who had paid for the entire thing discovered that a security guard had seen her trip trying to get to the bathroom and had deemed her too drunk to come back in. To be fair, she had a couple drinks and was certainly not sober but by no means was she belligerent either. The booths sit on a raised platform and the back of the theater was almost pitch black; when she stood up to go to the restroom she missed the ledge and slid on ice from a drink someone had spilled in front of our table that had not been cleaned up.. . My boyfriend spent nearly an hour lobbying for her to be allowed to re-enter (by this point everyone has completely sobered up and the mood is ruined anyway, not to mentioned we've missed most of the show), to no avail. . . Just to summarize, we spent about three grand total for this "performance" only to miss most of the show, be told that our friend was too drunk to come in (how is it even possible to be too drunk to get into a club on Satruday night in Vegas--especially when you've paid for bottle service??), and generally be treated as second class citizens, the most disturbing part was how rude and disrespectful the bouncers/staff were. They openly mocked my friend while she waited outside the theater, ("guess you should have learned to handle your liquor," laughed in my boyfriends face when he pointed out that we were spending a fair amount of money, and  generally seemed to take perverse pleasure in ruining the evening for everyone.. . I had always heard that the staff and service at MGM were sub par and this experience did nothing to persuade me to feel otherwise. We spent several thousand dollars on a show we barely saw, drinks we apparently should not have actually drunk because heaven forbid(!) someone become intoxicated in the club, and  an overall atmosphere that wasn't even that fun. Whether you're looking to spend $100 or $3000, I'd highly recommend avoiding Beachers Mad House at all costs.
Great Casino Buffet Restaurant & FREAKIN LIONS. . SITREP. . Every time I pop into the MGM Grand Hotel, it's a fun casual experience.. . THE SETUP. . I love their dining buffets because they are quick & efficient.  Lunch runs $19.99.  Dinner runs $29.99.  (I never do both on the same day since I eat like it's my only meal of the day!). . LIONS! . . The LIONS in their large area are fun to watch interact with one another and the people.  They bring a LOT of spectators who are fascinated by being so close to observe them.  But part of me feels this is not kind to them.  So I am conflicted about this to be honest.  [Update:  see note at bottomof this review about the Lions new whereabouts]  :D. . SHUTTLE PICK-UP. . MGM Grand is also one of the major drop-off and get-on locations for catching shuttles back and forth from Mc Carran airport.  Great place to know.. . THE LOWDOWN. . My casual hotel run-in / grab a bite / run-out and hit the strip place.. . ADDITIONAL UPDATE - Owner Response within 24 HRS. . Here is one of two messages I just received in less than 24 hours from the MGM Owners Group.  You can't see this personal message below since it's in my Yelp inbox.  However, there is a 2nd message that shows up on the Business profile attached to my review (though these messages are not viewable from one's personal Yelp profile page).  A great response below to the Lion Issue.  Now that was unlooked for!  Message begins:. . March 10, 2014. . Social M.. Owner. . Dear Michelangelo:. . Thank you for expressing your concerns regarding the MGM Grand Lion Habitat. . . The MGM Grand Lion Habitat closed as part of a property wide renovation project. Head trainer Keith Evans will continue to care for the lions at his large desert compound here in Southern Nevada, where the animals have actually spent the majority of their lives. Several years ago, MGM Grand and Mr. Evans established means to ensure that the lions will receive proper care for the rest of their lives.. . The lion will remain an icon and logo forever associated with the MGM Grand brand.  We truly value your comments and patronage, and look forward to serving you again in the future.. . Sincerely,. .

What a horrible experience! Overpriced eating, rude and infrequent cocktail waitresses on the casino floor and even worse hotel staff. I just stayed there for 11 days. Three of the days my room was not made up before my return in the late afternoon. There were pot smokers on my floor the whole time. It smelt as if I were in Jamaica! I complained many times to no avail. As a matter if fact, I got tired of complaining!! . . The last convention I was given some discounted dining and show tickets. I asked for them this time and was told "we don't do that anymore." I said, "Really? I'm here for 11 days at $X rate and you can't give up something?" Friends staying at The Flamingo were offered such without asking. Hmmmmm.... . I ordered room service one night. The steak was over cooked and cold. The potatoes were forgotten. $75... I expected more. I still tipped $20.. . I have stayed at the MGM 3 times in the past and was satisfied enough to come back. However, upon check out I told the representative of my dissatisfaction hoping for an apology of sincerity. She could care less and shoed me on my way. You may kiss my backside if I ever stay in your hotel again. For the amount of money spent on my 11 day trip, the next MINExpo 2016 and CONEXPO 2017 will be spent on a property not associated with the MGM.
I will go to a casino a couple of times a year with my boyfriend and we decided to go to the MGM in Vegas a week ago. The hotel was huge with plenty of slots and tables.  The food was pretty good but could be better. You can certainly get any cuisine you want. If not, the hotel is right on the strip so you can get to other casinos ant restaurants really easy.  The only bad thing is that I think we must have had some spring breakers there because it could get a little more wild than I like at a casino. Went out to the clubs once and had fun but was expensive.
Husband and I stayed in the West Wing over Valentine's weekend. He's been after me to go to Vegas for years but we had to wait until after my knee replacement a couple years ago. Good thing, too, you will walk like you;ve never walked before in Vegas.. . That aside, reservations I made on expedia gave us a great rate for 5 nights. We took the first flight out of Omaha and arrived at the hotel lobby probably around 9:45 AM Vegas time. Paid for early check-in which I was glad was available. Only drawback was we did not get the smoking room on a higher floor I had requested; not that big a deal. Didn't wait very long in check-in, staff was most courteous and helpful. Got to our room, everything was ready for us. Changed out of our Midwestern woolens; had a sandwich at the little deli next to the sports book (my introduction to Vegas' high food prices). . . Disappointed that the room did not have a little coffee maker like most hotels in this price range we've stayed at. But I suppose that many little appliances would be a logistical nightmare, and MGM would have to hire a 24/7 staff of probably 100 people just to handle replacing coffee makers and restocking coffee. Gladly once we found the "short-cut" of the West Wing elevators to the West Wing bar, an early morning trip to Starbucks was de rigeuer, and then outside the door by the West Wing bar to sip coffee and smoke cigarettes.. . The place is indeed big; if you stay long enough you will learn the tricks and shortcuts like we did. The Monorail station was a huge plus; the jaunt to get to it from our room not so much.. . Ate supper at the Avenue Cafe Friday night and breakfast there Sat., Sun. and Mon. Had the brunch buffet the Tuesday morning we left. All great food, very friendly and courteous service (except the server at the buffet wasn't as nice).. . We gambled here a lot the first two days we were there, but on weekends they raise the minimum limit on table games out of our budget range. So over the weekend if we gambled here we played slots or video blackjack and poker. Great thing about the casino bar...sidle up to one of those video card games and stick in a $20 bill and bet 25 cents a  hand you can get quite drunk on free magaritas!. . I enjoyed everything about our stay...sure, food was pricey but where isn't it in Vegas? The valet parking area sure seems like it runs like clockwork. I would give 5 stars except for the fact I had to get up and go looking for coffee every morning, the minimum limits on table games Friday, Saturday and Sunday were ridiculous and the Rain Forest Cafe was pretty bad. But we would stay here again!
I have respect for the MGM.  Considering its age, it's doing alright.  The decor for the lobby, casino, restaurants, and rooms is all nicely updated.  . . My major number one complaint about this place, and it's probably something I can't get away from in Vegas, is the cigarette smell that manages to sneak its way into the non-smoking rooms.  I'm not sure if it's just seeping out of the walls from smoking days gone by, or if it's getting through the vent system or whatever the case is.  . . The staff have always been attentive and friendly, and they are pretty organized here.  No troubles in that regard.  Price is decent. . . Still a long-ass walk to the convention center, but hey we all need our exercise.  They have a ton of stuff to keep you busy here, and you will not be bored.  Their gift shops have a pretty decent selection of items.. . One thing I could not locate: a normal, business-appropriate belt.  What gives?
The gaming staff here is mixed. I went to play at the MGM Grand two different times during my stay in Vegas and got two different experiences each time. Note: I did not stay at the MGM, so this does not include any rating for the hotel - just the casino and the food.. . On my first visit, it seemed that all the tables were, at a bare minimum $15 for blackjack and craps. I asked one of the pit bosses if there was anything cheaper and he said if I went to the back pit, far from the front doors, I could find a $5 table. I didn't see one back there, so I asked that pit boss, and she permitted to me to play for $5/hand at a table that was just starting up. It was a little odd though because she made other people who joined later play $15/hand but kept letting me play for $5 because I was "grandfathered in" - I can't complain but I felt bad for the other players that weren't necessarily getting a fair deal.. . The second visit was a poorer one. I went to go redeem a ticket at the sports book and there were 3 windows open. All of the guys working the windows were taking their good old time chatting up the young ladies that were placing bets. I waited, the only person in line, for over 5 minutes before finally one woman finished and left the window. I walk up to the window and the supervisor comes over and says "sir, they'll get you at the other two windows" and changes this employee's sign to "closed." Good customer relations would mean letting me cash in my ticket real quick instead of directing me to another window that was still busy with the same people as before.. . For this reason, I probably won't be gaming at MGM on future Vegas trips. Their loss.. . The food was "meh." At the two cafes there, the coffee at each of them was horrible. Go to Starbucks instead.
Currently staying here now I'm west wing out room has small hole in ceiling maybe from a leak not sure but for expensive room per night I wouldn't expect that. Too.  Has no USB plug only outlets even embassy suites and most chain hotels have updated plug in for cell phones. Sat at $1 wheel of fortune playing for hours and cocktail waitress only came once spent $209 purchasing drinks could've been gambling with that. Not the best.
Be Aware, if you are in the new towers, I hope you are close to the person you are sharing the room with!! Bathrooms are a frosted glass door that doesn't lock or shut all the way, same goes for the shower, and they are the first section of the room you walk into! So if someone were to come inside while you were in the bathroom, i hope nobody's in the hallway.... I typically stay in the Signature, but got tired of the hike to the casino, so figured i'd give the hotel rooms a shot. I probably won't do it again. They are dark and "Modern" by modern I mean about 300 sq ft with a glass bathroom door and some art deco wall piece and a lamp that didn't work in my room. Window was overlooking a strange alley way in the back, in between the next tower and the back of the MGM, so no light could come through. I'd request the older rooms if i were you with a view of the strip or just stay at the signature and get your cardio on when you hike to the casino.
There are TONS of shops and restaurants throughout the property. They have a wide variety of options from high class expensive restaurants and shops to basics fast food like McDonald's. The casino is lively and clean.
This is my first time staying at the MGM. I got there around noon and was informed that check in wasn't until 3 or 4 and I would have to pay an extra $20 to check in early. I figured I might as well do it since I didn't want to lug my bags around for 3 hours. I got into the room and the carpet was stained, the sheets/pillows had black stains on them, the walls had..something...on them, the mirrors around the bed were scuffed, there were dings in the nightstands, and the room was very dark. That was just the main room. The bathroom was another story. I found out I could easily lift the mirror off the wall and see the plumbing behind it, the sink just looked old and worn down, and the shower door did not close which meant that water leaked all over the floor whenever you wanted to take a shower. The hairdryer in the room smelled like smoke every time you used it! The absolute worst part was the huge, nasty, ball of black hair on the floor when I first checked in. NASTY!! The view was of the back of the building..not great at all. I didn't mind that, since I wasn't in the room at all times. The good part about the room was the bed was super comfortable and the pillows were amazing. . . I will probably not be back at the MGM any time soon. The resort fees are ridiculous - especially since the internet is so slow!
Typically we are Wynn faithfuls, but we stayed at the MGM Grand with friends this past week and really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were incredibly modern and updated. My only complaint is the sink and tub drainage was slow.. . We'll definitely come and stay at the MGM Grand again!
Stayed at the MGM last year in May and the stay was great.. Except check-in was  at 3pm and Our room wasnt ready..So we waitied finally  got in the room and the view was horrible all I looked at was the back of buildings for almost $800 wasnt happy..food was good atmosphere was good.. Will be back May 26 getting married, and Im giving MGM  another chance hopefully i have a better view of the strip this time and room be ready.. But i  will give them 3stars..
We booked 2 rooms from Mar 20th - 23rd, with one room being a Grand Tower Queen room and the other room being a West Wing King room. My wife and I have stayed in a GT room before so we decided to stay in the WW room this trip and let my parents and brother have the GT room. The GT room was the same set up as last time we were there and my parents had no complaints with the room. . . Here is where our trip started to go south. We check into our room in the WW and head up to it. We walk in and it is quite modern with newer faucets and so on. I begin to check out the room, even though it was pretty small and not much space. As I'm looking at the art piece on the wall I see that there has been previous guests who thought it would be funny to write throughout the art work. I'm not a snob or prude by any mean but I would think the MGM would want to try and cover up any vandalism or bad look in there rooms. I then go to turn on the Bose stereo in the room to find that it does not have an Aux port (which is says on the stereo itself) as well as a bobby pin sticking out the antenna to try and get reception which clearly did not work. This really isn't a big deal cause we all have Pandora or Itunes on our phones so we would be ok. Then we go to take a shower and with in 15 minutes we have to turn off the shower completely due to the severe drainage problem that caused a 3 inch pond in our shower. We're starting to become a little unhappy with the room for the amount that we paid but we're trying to make the best out of it because we are in Vegas. Finally as we are getting ready to go out for the night we notice a pretty bad crack as well as water damage and water bubble in our ceiling above the television. I understand that all hotel rooms may come with problems but I feel for the amount of money we paid ($250+/night) this was pretty ridiculous. . . I spoke with a few different managers throughout the weekend. They sent a maintenance guy to our room to look at the drainage problem. He was there about 5 minutes and told us everything was taken care of. The drain was better but it still backed up on us a little bit. I had to then contact the front desk around 1:00 AM since they failed to call me like they said they would with an update. The manager who I spoke with said the ceiling damage was from a previous water leak and our property would be damaged. So what your telling me is that it's normal for a room to be damaged and still rent that room. Instead of properly handling the leak and maybe re-drywall the ceiling or at least patch it. A room change was offered to us around 1:30 AM (Fri Night/Sat Morn) but the inconvenience of moving all of our unpacked items was not worth the room change. They ended up refunding us $56 which was the resort fees and tax.. . I've stayed at MGM numerous times before with usually good trip reports. I even have a bachelor party booked here for Aug so I am a loyal Mlife member. This trip did change my view and overall feel for this casino.
Had a great time at the MGM GRAND. Grand premier queen and it was nice and roomy.  Service was great will definitely come and still here again.
The room was paid for by Myvegas so I can't comment on the price. The pool was a huge let down compared to Mandalay Bay. The kids seemed like a bother even though most people had kids with them. The lazy river is nice but you can't bring your own tube and they will try to rent you one. I bought one in the splash shop for 6 dollars for me and 3 dollars for a kid. Don't buy the handle tube.
Pros:. Clean. This hotel is big and nice.. Friendly staff. Free booze when you gamble.. A lot of shops when you walk from the parking garage to the main lobby.. The buffet was really good, but pricey.. . . Cons:. You can get lost in this hotel.. This hotel can be super crowded at the main floor of the hotel.
No more lions :(. . I'm a fan of the MGM-series of hotels. This place has a tram stop under it, so that is nice. I have never stayed here, but walk through it often and visit it often enough. I like the layout, it feels very open and not cramped.. . It's unfortunate that they got rid of the lions. Besides the shows it has, I really don't think there is any stand-out draw or reason to come here anymore. Nearly everything else it has can be found elsewhere.
Watching the Hangover made me all hyped up about the MGM. But I know my experience is not gonna be as wild. They made the hotel seems so cool. But the hotel is actually pretty boring. Full of business peeps and old people. There were a lot of construction at the time and there were a lot "walking around the block".. . For a fancy pantsy hotel, the room isn't that great. I understand that this place is super old and famous, but it wouldnt hurt to upgrade the rooms a bit. My carpet smelled like cigarettes and the decor was so old fashioned. THe only thing I liked about the room is the bed. The comforter was so fluffy and soft. The bed was sorta hard. The standard room is quite small compared to other hotels. Heck, even Bally's is bigger. The bathroom was whatever. Nothing special about. Nothing worth to take home (shampoo, soap bar, and face wash). The thing I like about this place is that on the first floor, there is a water fountain in the middle. It is gorgeous. . . The hotel has a buffet inside and the food is pretty decent. I think any brunch buffet is good. Why? Cuz they have scrambled eggs and toast! Other than that, everything was mediocre.. . Casino is sorta big and pretty crowded. That craps table is a ripped off lol. But that black jack machine...whooooo!. . Price is expensive in general to me. it doesnt matter if it is during an event or not, just too much moola for muah.
We stayed at MGM for 3 nights last week. It was overall a really good experience with a few bumps alongthe way. Let's break it down:. . Rooms: (3 stars) the rooms overall were small but modern and did the job just fine. We didn't have a good view but we were in the west tower and only on the 5th floor. I didn't like the bathrooms because there is only a door to the toilet so privacy is minimal. Also there was barely any counter space in the bathroom making getting ready a challenge. I thought the bed was comfy but others thought it was hard. All in all the room was fine. . . Issues: I called a week ahead to get all three rooms close to each other or even on the same floor, they said it wouldn't be a problem so I was a little frustrated when they couldn't accommodate this when we checked in. Also, the actual door mechanism on my parents door (what you slide your card into) broke on the first night. They had to wait outside their room at midnight for 1.5 hours for someone to come fix it. They finally came, and the next day we were comped $300 for food and drinks at MGM restaurants so they handled our problem really well and we were totally content and over the door issue. . . Casino: (4 stars) out of all of the casinos this is the one we all won the most money at! We also really liked how big it was, huge sports book, lots of tables, and slots galore. We really enjoyed the virtual craps, blackjack, and roulette: all the fun without the pressure of playing at a table. . . Staff: The staff here were awesome! Stephanie (from NY!) and Michelle were great on the roulette table and some of the best casino workers I've come across!!!. . Food: There are a ton of food options in the MGM so if you're staying here don't overlook your options! They have a food court for fast, cheap, or late night eats stocked with the basics like McDonalds, Nathan's, and Pizza. They also have finer dining options like Craftsteak and Emeril's. . . MGM location: Bottom line is that the MGM is HUGE. To get from our room to the casino took at least 5 minutes. Everywhere you go in the casino it's far away so plan for comfy shoes. Also, a lot of people told us we stayed on the wrong end of the strip and I have to disagree. Yes this is farther away from the mirage and Venetian but the walk is doable (and entertaining) and the tram is easy. . . I would probably check out another hotel next time I am in Vegas but I enjoyed our stay at the MGM grand.
