This was my 3rd Cirque show and I have to say it was the best so far. Being a product of the sixties I have to say it brought back a lot of fond memories
It's been quite a few years since I saw this show but I only recently discovered that we were able to write Yelp reviews for Cirque Du Soleil. This was the first cirque show I ever saw and I went in totally not knowing what to expect and I left totally blown away. I am now a huge fan of Cirque du Soleil and have slowly been working my way thru all their shows in Vegas.. . I love the Beatles and I went with my parents who are also huge fans from their youth so we all really enjoyed the music. There is not much of a story to this show but each song has it's own characters and mini performance to go along with the theme of the music. Everything was so amazing because it designed to be surreal and whimsical. Most of the other shows impress you with the athletic abilities of the performers and the technical efforts of the show designers. This one really tries to make you believe that it is all magic. It looks so effortless. It is just amazing!. . I think it is absolutely a must-see if you are a Beatles fan.
Ok so I was a virgin before this show so maybe I can't write a review and compare to others that may be better BUT for those of you that are virgins and on the fence about seeing a show, I say DO IT!!! Go for it. I loved LOVE and would see it again. So glad my girl talked me into going....thanks baby.
This was my first Cirque show.  My boyfriend and I went Feb 22, 2014 saturday show at 9:30pm.  It was wonderful.  We got a deal where you book two nights, you get a two tickets to a show for free.  Obviously since the seats were free, they were all the way up top.  BUT , we could see everything.  The music was awesome (duh) and the speakers in the seats was an added bonus.  I laughed, cried and smiled the ENTIRE show.  The person I was sitting next to didn't seem like she was having a good time (only con).  I hope my singing and constant foot tapping didn't annoy her too much.  Overall, great time and I would totally do it again - and pay for it next time too!  If you are a Beatles fan this is a must see!
More a dance show than other Cirque shows. It's.  pretty amazing. As always, you sat there with your mouth open taking it in. I've seen most of the shows and this one is up there. The costumes,sets and script are all pretty terrific. And then there is the Beatles Music!
One of the coolest things I have ever seen.. . The theater is designed so that there isn't a bad view in the house (360 degree/shifting stage), and stuff flies in from every corner of the arena. We sat in the third deck and had people flying over our heads all night.. . The things that they did in this show just blew my mind and I would recommend this show to anyone, Beatles fan or not. I have every intention of seeing it again.
This show is music and dance  number with very very few acrobatics,  it's not a Cirque du Soleil acrobatic and stunt master piece it's a musical.   Lots to technical problems our show was stopped in the middle for 35 minutes.   For the prices I would expect more reliability of the show, but things happen.   During the 35 min  mid show stop due to technical problems they would not tell us how long or what's going on.   Rude ushers "sorry I can't disclose any information".  The crown tried to have fun and do the wave around the theatre but the ushers began yelling at everyone to stop.   I'm sorry I paid a $100 per ticket and your show broke down and the ushers are yelling at people to stop having fun come on really.   $8 sprite that's gouging.    The staff laughed at us for asking for a discount due to the show breakdowns, delays and interruptions.   Overall I can't recommend this show.   Rude staff, mediocre performance  very little acrobatics which you would expect from a  Cirque show, technical problems and delays, and ridiculous prices for what you get.   Save your money and skip this show.
I wanted to take my dad there and it was a good choice. besides O is one of the best shows i've seen in Vegas. Worth it!
It's good but a little overpriced. I am local so waited until someone else wanted to go which was  the right choice. I probably wouldn't go again because I think there's so many other shows to see but it was entertaining.  I did see a couple people napping so if you get sleepy... beware! However, the sleepy ones still loved it. . . The show is aesthetically gorgeous and with lots of attention to detail. It's a huge space so not very intimate but it doesn't feel cold. I'm sure you would catch additional details if you went again but I think once is enough for me. . . The show played some classic Beatles songs and several that were not as popular. I appreciated this because I am a Beatles fan but if you're not you may not recognize as many songs as you think you would.
This was a total disappointment.  Basically the show is a long interprative dance/modern ballet with some acrobatics mixed in.  No plot, nothing jaw dropping like the other Cirque shows in Las Vegas. Just a snooze fest.  The only good part is the Beatles music, but you can hear that on your stereo at home.  No need to pay over $100 to hear Beatles songs played very loudly in a theater over loudspeakers. My advise: save your money and go see something else.
Amazing amazing show! I had very high expectations and this was even better than I imagined! Every seat is a good seat, the stage is amazing and unique, the costumes were beautiful, and of course, the music was perfect. . . This is a great show for people of all ages. There's no way to get bored when there is so much going on all around you. I definitely recommend everyone go see this. . . Make sure you check out the Beatles "REVOLUTION" lounge before or after the show. The bartenders are nice and it is a great atmosphere.
Superb show!. Definitely worth the ticket price.. . Tip : Get seats further away from the stage (the view is much better)...
In general I am a big fan of Cirque du Soleil. Nearly every show I have seen there have been parts where I wondered on the uniqueness and talent of what I was seeing and Love is no exception to that. The theme helps bring everything together and there doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the house. In addition to being mesmerized by what is happening on the stage floor there is a part where the entire audience is undera large parachute that is really quite magical.
This is my third Cirque show and by far my favorite.  There is just so much going on in front of you and around you in combination with the music which makes it such an intense experience. I have to admit I don't get a lot of the Cirque action,but I tip my hat to those on stage who do things with their bodies that I could only dream about. All of the acrobatics were executed flawlessly and were thrilling.  Also a treat to see those very in shape male performers without a tacky venue.  A true delight for the eyes and the ears although I was picking some large confetti out of my dress after the show .. I highly recommend this for anyone who is a Beatles fan(how can anyone not be).
Simply said, I LOVED Love.  It's as good as it gets.  We sat pretty close to the front but  I think that there is probably not a bad seat anywhere.  See it NOW!  You won't be sorry!
Omg! Absolutely amazing show!  I have seen several Cirque shows but this one was the best! . . Great performances by all. Symbolism was awesome. . . Several times I found myself on the edge of my seat and the show was never predictable.
LOVED IT! I'm not a huge Beatles fan but this show was extremely entertaining!
