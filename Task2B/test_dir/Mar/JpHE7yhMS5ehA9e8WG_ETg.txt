This place is a joke, an absolute disgrace, and the epitome of why we locals do not frequent the strip. They take your money and give you nothing in return. The excellence and luxury are a facade and standards are almost non-existent with no concern for consequence, they are, of course, "The Aria on the Las Vegas Strip!" Yet another production house. People will continue to come here and let them financially violate them and then go home and tell stories of how terrible Las Vegas is. Thank you for your great contribution to Las Vegas tourism Aria Hotel and Casino. We weren't even here for 12 hours, most of which was spent trying to sleep, before I had somany unbelievably negative things to say about our experience that I didn't even want to write a review just so I could stop focusing on all the bad and try and enjoy the rest of my Staycation if possible. It's not even necessary to go into details, stay here at your own risk, or lower your expectations.
Stayed here for a national sales meeting.  What a beautiful hotel.  When I walked into my room the lights automatically came on, the blinds were opened to revealed the stunning view, and music began playing.  It was pretty cool, why can't that happen at home? ;).  Enjoyed a couple different restaurants and the Aria is close to a lot of great attractions.  Loved it!
Loved:. - very stylish hotel, modern, stunning. - loved the tech'ed out room with control panel and how lights and drapes "greeted us" when we arrived. - very friendly staff. - beautiful room. - VERY well laid out hotel with everything you would want...Starbucks, beautiful classy Casino, great restaurants, store with liquor, etc.. . What will get me back even though we love the Venetian? The floor to ceiling windows across the entire room with fantastic Strip view... get the City view room, pay the extra bucks.. . Cons? Can't think of any...except we REALLY did not like the Show...Zarkana....see separate review for this.
Hotel is great. Some of the staff are snooty. Overall I will return.
I've been here a few times since Aria opened to hang out or gamble but our February trip for the hubby's birthday was our first time staying at the hotel. It is a pretty big property so the experience is similar to staying at MGM or Cesar's but I actually think their signage is a little better so I never got lost and was always able to find my way back to the room. I also appreciate that they have someone checking room keys day and night to make sure no one gets on the elevators other than people who are staying there (or overnight guests of someone staying there, wink, wink... hey it's Vegas after all).. . I found the room to be plain but adequate. The bathroom was pretty nice. There was nice tile/granite and a big garden tub that was behind the shower so if the water overflowed it went down the shower drain. Very smart. However, I did notice some of the bathroom tiles had a little bit of staining/mildew. So, not perfect. Really my only major issue was the bed. It was just not comfortable. It felt really lumpy. It was soft, which is how I prefer my mattresses, but it just felt worn out. I also didn't like that they had a synthetic comforter instead of a duvet with a sheet cover that could be washed. Most hotels are doing that nowadays for sanitary reasons. Also, their "blackout" curtains let in a bunch of light from the top which also made it difficult to sleep late. Anyway for whatever reason I just couldn't get a good sleep there and so that is the main reason for subtracting a couple stars. I mean, you can go to any casino in Vegas to gamble/eat/drink but you need a comfortable sleep afterwards so that's the main reason for staying somewhere nice, right?. . I do still think Aria is a great property, though. I like their understated decor and lack of a cheesy theme. I don't really care for their buffet but all the other restaurants we've tried have been very good. And we did get a chance to use their pool area and it was really nice as well. A major bummer was that they did not have anyone serving drinks and there was always a line at the bar. Someone needs to tell Aria that the recession is over and they need to staff up. They did not have enough valets or people working the front desk either. Or servers in the casino area. One day our room did not get cleaned at all. It really just seemed that they were entirely short-staffed the entire weekend even though it was not particularly busy.
Amazing MGM brand hotel that's connected to the crystal shopping center and has free trams that take you to the Bellagio Hotel. . . The casino is a bit dark and too grungy for my taste, but I love their rooms. Modern and luxurious, with a spectacular view, but I can't tell you how amazing and comfortable their beds are. It's the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in I just had to have it. I contemplated on stealing it somehow, but I guess that would've been difficult with it being so big and all. . . My husband thought I was insane and ridiculous, but said he wishes there was a way for me to get it because if there was a way, he would.  He probably just said that to shut me up, but hahaha, jokes on him, because GUESS WHAT! YOU CAN! I bought the mattress from the gift shop. I knew this level of comfort was insane to not profit from. Aria Hotel is so smart that they branded their own custom mattresses and offer people to purchase it from their very own gift shop and they deliver it right at your home.. . I am now sleeping in luxury every night. Thank you Aria Hotel, for giving me the bed of my dreams. (haha, get it?.....................I'll see myself out)
Huge fan of Aria Hotel!  My significant other and I stayed here last summer and absolutely loved it.  This was my first time in Vegas and I'm so glad we didn't decide to stay at a cheaper, cliche, themed hotel.  . . This hotel was very luxurious and I almost didn't want to come home to my piddly loft downtown.  What do you mean my apt doesn't have remote controlled drapes, lighting, television, music and climate?  PFT, screw that! . . The security was a nice feature.  They [room]card you before entering the elevator lobby so non-guests aren't able to just waltz in.  . . I must admit, I'm not sure about Vegas.  I think I could not go back and not feel like I'm missing anything since I'm not big on gambling and clubbing hasn't been my thing for about 10 years.  Come to think of it, I'm only 28 so it's definitely never been my thing!  BUT I would come back here in a heart beat JUST for the pool.  That triple digit heat, the pool-side alcohol service, the hot bodies, people watching.  Def. saw a lot of young women with some wrinkly old men - they totally married for love!  If I ever go back to Vegas the pool is where you'll find me.. . The whole experience was very relaxing and glam.  And the location, center-strip, can't be beat.  A lot of the good shopping and sights are an easy walk.  However, there really is no reason to leave the hotel.  Everything you need is right there.  Food, gambling, pools, clubs, ZARKANA etc.  However, it was rather convenient to have CVS (walgreens? can't remember) just a short walk across the strip...regular priced sunscreen is better than the crazy marked up stuff in the hotel.  . . PS the casino is smoke free!
Review definitely over due.. On dec 16 I think was the grand opening on dec 20 ish was when I booked the hotel and it was at that time the price was approx $150 for the night plus $75 resort credit oh yeah! . . At the time housekeeping still needed to be tweaked they were missing towels and the soap was gone. I mean the little things right? But of course this is just the beginning they could change by now and very efficient. Especially since the price is in the 2s on even the cheapest nights wtf?. . You know for a hotel that big the rooms are tight! For double beds it was cramped. The rooms are modern and tech savvy. First time I can open the curtains automatically.. . It's far walk to the front but I like the free train to crystals and Bellagio. The walk to Monte Carlo is not bad too..
Enjoyed a recent four-night stay at the Aria. Unlike the many theme hotels in Las Vegas, the Aria has a striking contemporary design that would not be out of place in any major world city, like New York or Hong Kong, Los Angeles or Shanghai. The facilities are extensive and modern: a large casino, many restaurants (most in the higher price range), palm tree-lined pool, spa, salon and fitness centre, and the requisite Cirque du Soleil show. The hotel is adjacent to the high-end Crystals shopping mall and connected by tram to the Bellagio and Monte Carlo hotels. Rooms are a good size and well-finished, although housekeeping was perhaps not quite five-star standard. Staff were friendly and professional. Due to a health condition, I had booked a wheelchair-accessible room (and had hoped to get an adjoining room for my brother, however none was available when we checked in). The facilities in the wheelchair-accessible room weren't all that I was hoping, however the hotel did provide a shower chair and, after much prompting and back-and-forth with the concierge desk, a commode chair for the toilet. I was disappointed that hotel of this caliber did not handle this issue as promptly and efficiently as they might have, but things worked out in the end. Rating: 4.5/5.
Room was a bit too high tech but was great. Clean, modern, casino was great and nice pool. . . But the one thing I loved? CUSTOMER SERVICE. . . I left my iPad there. They eventually found it and shipped it back to me, free of charge! . . . Thank goodness for their honesty and commitment to customer service!
Caesars palace used to be my fav but boy welcome to the year 200 - Aria!! The sky suites are amazing! The service the place is second to none and I've stayed at the Wynn and encore too...doesn't compare! For me Aria is the best!
DIRTY.  Dirty, dirty, dirty.   I was excited to have a corner suite at Aria, but I sat on my couch and pulled a pair of dirty women's underwear out from under a couch cushion.  Then, in the awesome bathroom, I dropped my hairbrush on the floor, and when I bent down to get it, there were 4 Xanax on the floor, under the vanity.  Neither of the above items were mine; we had just checked in.  I asked to change rooms and a room upgrade, and they told me that would be difficult.  They put an equal room on hold for me, but I couldn't get into it until 6pm the FOLLOWING day.   Really more of a hassle to move rooms.  Then, later in my stay, as I was walking from the shower to my room, I sliced the bottom of my foot open on a carpet staple/nail that was loose.  Hurts like hell.   Since I had already officially "checked out" online early that morning, they wouldn't do anything about that.   For all of this, in a 48 hour stay, after talking with the management for a day and a half, they finally offered me a $100 credit on anything inside the hotel.  $100 does not buy 1 show ticket, or 1 spa treatment.  I still had to spend more money there.   I could not use $100 on food, since I was at a work conference. Some BS if you ask me.  I will not return to the Aria, would not recommend it, and will not stay there next year, if the conference is there again.
I am shocked by the 5 star reviews of this property. The lobby is nice and the woman who checked us in was kind but very slow. We were told we were upgraded only to discover we went from the 9th floor to the 18th floor. The Aria is set back away from the strip and the strip views are mostly parking lots. The room itself is very small. It is the size of a basic Sheraton hotel. The bed is lumpy and the comforter is not down and can not be cleaned. That was a big surprise at a 5 star hotel. The bathroom is very small with a glass toilet room that you can see through.  The bath and shower are combined making he bath claustrophobic and the water pressure was terrible. When we came back late at night the room had not been turned down and when we called we were told you have to request a turn down. That is not resort like. And finally the worst part of the hotel is the curtains. It was so bright in our room all night because of the lights and by 7 am we felt like we were sleeping outside on a park bench. Horrible! We will be leaving and I won't return. I have stayed at the Mandarin, the Belagio, the Wynn and the Encore and they are all far superior!
Beautiful hotel!  My boyfriend and I stayed for a couple of nights last week, and loved it.  The room was more like a suite, with a large "living" area and a ginormous bathroom.  The king size bed was like sleeping on clouds, I actually wondered if it would fit in the overhead bin so I could get it home!. . The wall coverings throughout the hotel make you want to remodel your house, WITH WALLPAPER!  They even used what appears to be upholstery in some of the hallways.  . . The drapes and lights were all remote control, probably not the best idea to set your honey down with the controls while you are showering, you may end up in the dark!  Customer service from check in to check out was off the charts amazing. I have never encountered so many wonderful people in one place.  . . The location was perfect, seemed to be smack in the middle of The Strip.  As I tend to do on vacation, I walked a lot and it was really nice to get back to such an awesome room after hours of walking. The toiletries smelled so good, I Googled them when I got home, only to find they are made exclusively for Aria.. . Don't hesitate to stay here, you will not regret it.
I booked 3 rooms for a bachelor party this past weekend. One of the rooms had repeated problems with little done by the hotel. One Friday night the toliet leaked about 2 inches of water in the bathroom, ruining clothes and our shoes. Naturally I called to complain and they 'cleaned' it up and 'fixed' the problem. Later in the weekend on Saturday we came back with water flooding the bathroom. I went to the manager Angela, who may be one of the least friendly managers I have ever experienced and asked for a refund, despite the fact I had a flooded bathroom 2 nights in a row she did NOTHING. WHAT A JOKE. I gave them so much business and their lack of service and putting the customer first is appalling. Do not stay here. I am going to spread the worst about my awful experience to avoid paying customers from getting ripped off. . . A flooded bathroom at the Aria gets you no discount or refund. Angela you absolutely failed as a manager and as figure head of an awfully run establishment. . . AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
It was a great long overdue visit back to Vega$ and NYE was well spent in the Aria.  Cool clean modern rooms, the TV/Media center was a little glitchy but worked.  Did okay in the casino at late night.  I happened to try getting a drink in the Gold Lounge @ a peak hour so it was just too damn busy with only one side serving as the bartender was dealing with more than enough unruly customers building up while one female argued with her about her tab and the others were pouring away the same on the other side. The Tower Suites were abuzz of course, but loved the courtesy pastries and drinks in the lobby.  gonna have to try again for a Penthouse Suite next time.
When it comes to state of the art amenities and cushiness, Aria has it covered. In fact, it was so fancy I had a hard time figuring out the lighting and drapes options on the little futuristic control board! And the great part about traveling to Vegas on weekdays for business is that you can find some pretty reasonable deals here, despite its top of the line furnishings! . . My favorite part was the elaborate turndown service they provide - they make the lighting sexy and turn on some soothing music, and even leave two packs of delicious chocolates on each nightstand. It made me want to jump right into bed when I entered my room that evening! . . I also love (and hate) that the Jean Philippe store is just downstairs. It's the perfect souvenir to bring home to friends (or to eat by yourself on the flight back)!. . Then why only four stars? Well, I guess what I felt was a lack of FUN. When I come to Vegas I expect fun, whether it be edgy decor or exciting restaurants. The Aria felt extremely huge and pretty sterile. I think next time for similar prices I'd prefer to go back to the Cosmo, which seems to have whimsical touches wherever you turn. I had a feeling that the Aria was maybe for an older clientele, or corporate travelers. . . Though I had a perfectly comfortable stay at Aria and got a great deal on it too, I guess I just expect more out of the box thinking from one of Vegas's most popular hotels!
by far the worst stay i've had in vegas.. . my first time at "aria" and i will not be coming back. the customer service is terrible and the management did little to nothing to help my situation.. . the security guards are unprofessional and offended me with their asshole like remarks.. . do not recommend. BEWARE! . . I would advise you to stay at the cosmos, vdara, bellagio, or pallazzo instead.
BLAH. . very expensive to stay here. this hotel has NO theme, not that nice, i did like it though it is clean and smells like vanilla when you walk in but i mean its such an average hotel. . . prefer Bellagio or Vdara for that matter. . the hotel rooms are nice, dont get me wrong, but im connecting the price with the rooms and hotel. . . not worth it in my opinion, unless you can get a killer deal, go elsewhere
The Aria is a beautiful hotel, but the service and design leaves a lot to be desired. I didn't meet one happy staff member during my entire time checking out their casino. Furthermore, the whole campus is intentionally designed to keep you from leaving. The traffic loop outside makes it virtually impossible to get back to the Strip. Poor signage shows that they intentionally try to trap you so that you stay at their location, which is bad sportsmanship in my book. All of the other casinos on the Strip have clear, frequent signage that show what exits to take to get to other casinos, even if that casino is a competitor owned by a different chain of properties.. . I'll allow for 2 stars because of how pretty the place is, but for the service and bad business sportsmanship, they're not going any farther.
The Aria is beautiful and sophisticated. Great location but the staff in the casino make you feel like you're being watched all the time. The slots in the casino are the worst I've ever experienced anywhere on the globe. I walked around for about an hour to see if other people were winning-not at all. This was over the course of three days Thursday Friday and Saturday. The situation was much difference at Caesar's Palace, The Bellagio and the Cosmo. It seems like a lot of people winning on the slots there and at the table. Plus I was serves drinks regularly and I had to practically send up a flare to get a drink at the Aria.  You could stay at Aria but play slots somewhere else!!
My friends and I stayed at Aria last week for 3 nights. . . Pros. - You can check in early if the room is ready. -They give you the key as many as you need.. -If you are a member of MLife, and play tournaments or 5 hours at the table, you will get comped. In fact, our hotel room became $970 to $550 by playing 1 tournament and 10 hours of poker! (They will be able to add all of our time spending there which is AWESOME). -The hotel stuffs are very nice. . -The room is fancy and makes you enjoy Vegas even more with the view from the room.. -The hotel is located right at where you want to be (Close to everything!). -Drinks are free in casino.. -The restaurant close to the entrance that serves tapas is VERY GOOD!!!! Everything is so great!!! Our server YOSHI was the kindest, funniest, and coolest server ever.. His service totally enhanced our meal.. -Pools are very nice and clean. Service was great also.. . Cons. -The waitress at the casino gave me the worst attitude. (Just that person but no body else). -Lemon Grass (restaurant) was good but over priced.. -Hot tub was cold.. . I mean everyone is there to have fun because it is Vegas!! . . I will definitely come back and stay here this summer!. . TURNTUPPP!
The only casino on the strip that won't even let you touch the cars for three card poker.  That's right, you read correctly, they deal the cards face up, all three cards, like blackjack.  I was like what the hell, why you opening my cards for me?  Dealer explained that was the policy.   . . On top of this weird policy, their limit was set sky high, $50 table for blackjacks, $25 tables for ultimate texas holdem, and various other games, I was just taken aback by how expensive it was play there, even higher than Wynn Casino, so I was really turned off.  The place was dark and creepy with low lighting, dark walls, and unhappy dealers.  No wonder this place was close to bankruptcy.  There are plenty of other choice on the strip to gamble, I suggest you take your chances elsewhere.  Knowing how their trying to swing the odds in their favor, players do not have a chance!
My boyfriend and I stayed here for a few nights last weekend, and we loved it.  Beautiful hotel!  The rooms are state of the art with remote control curtains and lighting. Bathroom is large, loved the tub. The beds are very comfortable.  My favorite was the closets, and how they have two large closets with with enough hangers a space to hang plenty of dresses or dress shirts without having to share with the person you are traveling with. . . My only concern and reason I'm not giving it 5 stars was the night club, they need better security. Went in for 20 mins and saw 2 fights, poor bartenders were using the flashlights trying to get security to help and security was nowhere to be found. First time security never showed up and second time by the time security came girl was already punched in the face and pulled away from her friends. This made me feel very unsafe, bartenders should be able to get help from the security ASAP.  . So I left immediately after seeing the second fight and no security. .  . Food was good, a little expensive in certain restaurants but very good overall a beautiful hotel. More of an older crowd but I would stay here again.
One of my worst hotel experiences in vegas. I've stayed in 12 hotels in Las Vegas. Aria so far is up there as far as worst for customer service. Rooms clean and the curtains open electronically but besides that, worst service ever.. Got here, gym was closed, I asked them to find me one that was open and they more or less told me to find it myself.. Went to the gym Friday, the greeter there was a jerk and just stared at you rather than greating you. It felt like the employees were beaten or scolded by bad bosses.. Then came back to our room to smell like cigarettes, not a good experience
Bravo, Aria. Bravo.. . Does anyone remember coming to Las Vegas, 10 or so years ago and the most exciting hotel at the time was the Wynn? Ok, now take that up a notch by another 10. That is where Aria stands with being A W E S O M E.. . I went to Vegas just earlier this month, and it was the first time I'd even stepped foot in the Aria. What on earth took me so long, I don't know but I was impressed. My opinion of the Aria is that this is how the rest of Vegas should be, nowadays at least. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan of the old-school quarter machines too, but this hotel is keeping up with the times. . . We're in 2014 people, and we're not getting any younger. It's a pricey hotel, I'll tell you that much,but if you had the cash to blow, I'd say that you would want to try it at least once in your life. And yes, the attention to detail with their interior design is what really blew me away. The choice of tile, the hanging chandeliers, the type of seating that was used, the attire of the staff, all the way down to the matching handles in the ladies restroom. It all screams - CLASS.. . Now, my next goal is to try out that super swanky looking restaurant, SAGE. Yeah, definitely. Right after I save about 3 months worth of paychecks.
Do not bother unless you like to be ignored.   Was at the bar playing poker for more than 20 minutes with no bar service.  Good Job James the bartender.  Look for a new job
This Forbes awarded Sky Suite Rooms Ventilation is extremely poor to none, these eye watering, nose burning smokey suites r more like a overfilled wet ash tray!!  U try & take a breath in this sky suite tower hotel and u b will choking, gasping for air, this nonsmoking room/floor in this supposedly high end diamond hotel is cancer causing as soon as u walk in!! It's miserable to put it nicely ..  If u smoke, u will b in paradise !! I checked out on 2nd day of 8 day stay!!  Even my clothes in room if didn't wear make ur eyes water after hanging on closet..
The hotel is beautiful, artwork great too. We reserved a room with 2 queens and at check-in were told they're sold out but would give us a roll away. It took 5 phone calls over 5 hours to to finally get it. But, the location is fantastic.
I have been to Vegas several times and I have to say that by far this was the best hotel we have stayed at. The modern architecture was so cool and it was centrally located to everything. The rooms were very well appointed and since it was centrally located the views from our corner suite were amazing. The waitresses did not come by frequently while you were playing which caused us to gamble at other hotels. That was the only negative. We played several times during our 4 night stay and got two drinks out of it. Very disappointing but the service was great. The turn down service awesome. Still give them 5 stars!
I stayed here for Mega Madness. After working out from 7am to 7pm, who has the energy to drive home after? If you're a tourist, this is the area where you want to stay. Casino, self-park, valet.... . Room:. I loved the room I got. They have 23-25 floors. Mine had a nice city view - so beautiful at night. As soon as you enter the room, the curtains are automatically drawn. You can control anything with a simple touch of a button. They don't have DND door tags - press the privacy button next to the door and voila! The chocolates for their turndown service were good. The bed was very comfy. Flat-screen TV, mini bar, fridge, nice marble bathroom with separate shower and tub. The toiletries are by Citron - I was expecting something better but oh, well. The elevator doors are slow to close. I remember this place having 2 incidents of legionnaire's disease  a few years ago - after coming home, I got a fever and sore throat. Oh, no! There's free wi-fi in the room. 4/5. . Convention Center/ Ballrooms:. We were spread all over Bristlecone and Pinyon ballrooms since there were about 1,050 who attended the event. Very spacious, airy, bright and modern. High ceilings. The ballrooms are of different sizes to suit your needs. However, I was allergic to something on the carpet as I broke out in hives. 4/5. . Restaurants:. They have a lot of good restaurants on property. Jean Philippe Patisserie, Julian Serrano, She, Sage, barMASA, The Buffet, Jean Georges, American Fish, Five 50, etc. 4/5. . Bars/Clubs:. Haze, Lift Bar, Lobby Bar, The Deuce. Haze is a great club where great DJ's perform. 4/5. . Shopping:. They have gift shops for whatever needs you may have. Pool outfits, sunblock, water, snacks, etc. It's also minutes away from Crystals for shopping. 4/5
