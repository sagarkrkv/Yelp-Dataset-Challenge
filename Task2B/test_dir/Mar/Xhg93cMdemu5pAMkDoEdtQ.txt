If I was more loaded this would have been ok but being sober...umm no. It took a super long time and I ordered off the eat on the run menu. My sweet potato fries were chewy and cold and my corn dog was ridiculously hot. Will remember not to go there next time.
one of my favorite dessert spots in vegas!!!!! if you haven't been you must go
We've been to Serendipity several times & overall, I am a fan of it.  The portions are a good size to share with others, the pricing isn't too bad when you share (on your own it can be spendy but what place isn't on the strip?) & the food is of great quality.  My favorites include the Frozen Hot Chocolate (all varieties had are yummy!), the macaroni & cheese, the salmon, the spaghetti & the  best dessert - the deep fried oreos.  Soooo, so good.
Awesome place for a casual date night. Amazing ice-creams and tasty appetizers. I'm not a fan of the price but I can over look that for a special occasion.
I gave them 3 stars because I need to go back to find a better dessert.  All the reviews have some good things to say about the dessert and I am always looking for good desserts.  I asked the waitress which dessert has peanut butter.  I didn't taste much peanut butter.  The dessert was a mess of flavors and basically reminded me of a pig's trough.  So far not impressed with the dessert or the wait-staff's knowledge of the menu to give recommendations.. . WIll update when I get around to wanting some dessert.
Awesome little place to eat. Their frozen hot chocolate of course is a must to any meal. The onion rings were good, the pesto pasta was great. But the crab salad was the best! So good!
Known for the frozen hot chocolate. Recommend to get the frozen hot chocolate To-Go so you get more frozen hot chocolate, also avoids the wait for getting a table. Felt there was more whip cream versus the actual drink when we did the order for sit down.
This was a fun restaurant to visit!  Great customer service from every waiter that passed us by and the food was great!  The portions were pretty big, especially for the yummy desserts.  The only reason I took away a star was because the seating is kinda cramped so you have to carefully weave your way through the restaurant and play bumper chairs if you're seated next to the wall.  They do have seating outside, but this restaurant has been busy every time I passed by, so we settled for a semi-cramped table inside.  The missing star is also due to the prices, then again, this place is on the strip so that is expected.  Other than that, I totally recommend Serendipity for couples, families, and friends.
This was the second time I came to this place. My first experience was okay, it wasn't what I thought it would be. My 12 yr old and her friends loved their frozen hot chocolates but didn't finish them because it was too sweet and a bit pricey. My second experience was not a good experience at all. If it wasn't my hubby's friends who wanted to try this restaurant, I would've pick somewhere else. The place was dirty and it seemed like the staff didn't really like working there. My friend had ask to have her burger cut in half when she placed the order and was not cut so when the food came she told the waiter that she asked to have the burger cut in half. The waiter rudely said he'll get a knife (his demeanor was so rude like we were asking for the world), also same waiter, when he came to bring my order which was the worst pasta I've ever tasted (shrimp pesto pasta $20), he handed the plate to me and said it's hot. Yes, it was very hot since he had a  linen cloth to hold the plate and I didn't. It seemed like it just came out from the microwave oven. My pasta was not good at all, I wanted to throw up and not "fresh" like it said on the menu. Yes, I should've known, it's a desert place, but I was hungry and it was dinner time and didn't want the pizza or burger. So I ended up taking some of my hubby's cheeseburger which was good. I should've changed my order to something else but didn't want my food to get spit at. Anyway, if you come to experience this place, I suggest only order the frozen hot chocolates since it's what they're famous for and the cheeseburger.
Love love love this place. The frozen hot chocolate is yummy! Great fun to sit out on the patio at night and people watch while dining!
My girlfriends who traveled and visited Las Vegas for bachelorette parties always bragged about this place. I think this place is pretty and very girly but nothing special about the food. I begged my boyfriend to take me here and we only shared the cookies and cream sundae. It's good but taste like a milkshake! I rather sit on the couch and buy a big blue bell carton tub and share it with my boyfriend. There's plenty of other gorgeous places with better food. . . Oh yeah, if you're a fan of the show "Tanked" on Animal planet and coming here to look for the gumball fish tank, it's not here anymore. I read somewhere in the summer it got too hot and the fish got fried. Ouch! Poor fishies.
Great, large menu. Fun drinks. A great stop when you just want to munch and drink! David M was our server and he was AWESOME. :-). Those onion rings were stellar.
This place is good if you are with kids...or your fiance acts like a kid.  Either way you cannot go wrong.  Prices are a little steep, but look at where you are.  Did you think the chocolate shake would cost 99 cents?. . Stick with the sweets.  Maybe venture into the french fries type stuff....but do not go for much of anything else.  If you want pizza then go to Spago.  If you want Southwestern food then go to Mesa Grill.  If you want a burger then go to Mesa Grill, Bobby's Burger Palace, or Fat Burger.. . BUT!  If you want something sweet stop here.  Try and sit outside as well because it is extremely loud inside.  Also...count how many low riders and hydraulic cars you see.  For some reason they always start their southern migration when I visit Serendipity.  I guess they drive south on the strip for the night and hibernate at Tropicana (probably the only affordable hotel after splurging on the car).
Love hate relationship with this place. I loooove the food here and it's always fun to people watch all the tourists visiting but I hate the fact that it's on the strip. I usually park at the forum shops and walk all the way through the mall, casino and towards the strip to get here. Totally worth it but such an inconvenience. Oh and there is always a wait. Not too bad but it's torture during the summer when it's 120 degrees outside!. . I recently came here for restaurant week. They had a three course menu (drink, entree and dessert) for lunch at $20. I got the chocolaccino, hangover omelette and the frrrozen hot chocolate shot with an Oreo mousse cookie. It was way too much food but all so yummy. My friends and I also got a mimosa each. It was overpriced! $14 for a tiny glass. Definitely a mistake but oh well. . . Our waitress was such an awesome lady. She was super stoked to see we were locals and kept thanking us for coming out for restaurant week. I loved it! The only reason I didn't give all 5 stars is because of the inconvenience. I wish they would make another one that's not so touristy!
Be prepared to have thousands of calories in your delicious meal.
I was really looking forward to trying this place out and while the dessert I ordered was pretty good, the service was horrible.. . First off, it seemed like a good while until we were seated, even though the place didn't really look that crowded at all. And then, as soon as we were seated, it took FOREVER for a server to come to our table. . . Well, after that we did order some desserts. I ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate because I had to try it while my mom ordered some kind of sundae with Deep Fried Oreos on top. As I said before, the desserts were pretty good. Especially the oreos. I've never tasted something so good before. I will say though, I did hear that the Frozen Hot Chocolate was supposed to be warm AND cold at the same time, hence the name, but it all tasted like a milkshake. I mean, it was still good, but I was a bit disappointed in that tiny bit about it.. . Well, not only did it seem like our waiter completely forgot about us while we ate, it took forever for him to show up after we were finished eating so we could get the check. And then, it took him a good while again to come back and deliver our final receipt. . . Look, I would say to go to this place to try out the Frozen Hot Chocolate or some other dessert, but just be prepared about the service. Or not. Maybe they fixed that. I don't know.
This was such a fun place to eat. We went here before a concert we were going to see at Caesars Palace and loved it. The service was fast and courteous and the food was fantastic. I got a hamburger which was phenomenal and my wife chose a pasta dish which she loved so much she insists we return. The cherry on top of this great visit was experiencing the Frooozen Hot Choclate. This is by far one of the best non-alchoholic frozen beverages I have ever had. It is well worth the $15 price tag. Whether you are a Las Vegas local or just visiting, this is a fun and great place to eat. We will be back!
This place is a royal rip off. . . Because of the location on The Strip, they get by with mediocre bar food for entrees, poor service, and a snobby attitude, and at a Las Vegas Premium Price. . . Deserts are decent, but stay away from the main courses. You can do a lot better.. . Be prepared for a long wait, as well. . . If this place were in any other location, it would have been closed a long time ago. However, as long as there are young college kids, who have Dad's money to spend, and don't care about price, it will continue to flourish.
First time here and the service was horrible. Once we sat down it took 45mins to get out food and my food was cold. Talk to management and she straight up blamed the kitchen saying they are doing a menu change. No excuses my food was cold. The food was good so it gets one star.
I do not understand what the big deal is.  Horrible food, not seasoned, moronic waitstaff and horrendous atmosphere and decor.  Don't waste your time or money.  . . We had breakfast and the Huevos ranchero was compared to tasting like Taco Bell.  My egg sandwich needed salt and pepper and we never saw our server.. . Sugar Factory across the street offers similar food that taste better, plus good customer service.
I'm not a dessert or chocolate person, but my friends and I just decided to go because none of us have been here. . . We ordered from the outside and of course tried the frozen hot chocolate. Eh, not sure what's so special. I also had the coffee with nutmeg and cinnamon... Ehhh. I didn't even drink a fourth of it. Not sure how their food is, but really wasn't impressed with what we had. I might go again to try their food, but it definitely wouldn't be my 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th choice....
The food was good but not as good as we expected, especially the deserts at the price they ask for them. We went twice during our trip to try different things and both times the food was good but not great.
This place is over-hyped with poor customer service and average food. We were excited to take family there to experience the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. Indoors was a 30-45 min wait, with an emphasis on minimum of 30 min so we opted for the front patio area. We asked if they could turn on the heat lamps but they were completely out of propane per the hostess and manager. Ok. We endured the slight chill. If we asked if we could also put our name in for a table indoors, the hostess told us in a very condescending tone that if we wanted indoors, then we had to get out of our seats and wait in the waiting area.... And that we had to make up our minds as there was another party that could use our seats. Lovely. So we stayed outside. Five minutes later we see them light up the heat lamp that was next to the hostess and by the other large party.  Propane shortage over? No, just for them. Fantastic. Anyway so our party of 8 ordered and still enjoyed our time together. The food took over 20-30 min. The desserts came out first. By the end of our meal, we left a standard tip and went back to gambling. The next day as i was thinking about how much I paid, I realized that the total and subtotal has a $40 difference and tax isn't THAT much. They automatically added the gratuity. Ugh. While I realize this is somewhat standard, I wish the waitress would have been nice enough to remind/inform us. If the management says "well it's written on the menu", have you seen the size of their giant menu packed with choices and illustrations and tidbits??? Suffice to say, we clearly did not intend to give her  such a nice tip. Hope she and the staff there pay it forward. . . All in all, it's an experience. Try it at least once but don't expect great service. There are a ton of choices and everything is big enough to share. Grilled cheese with a side of tomato bisque is great for cheese lovers.
Wait was about 30 minutes on a Friday evening about 4 pm.. Service was fine. Food is good. Crab/Artichoke dip was awesome. Sundaes are GREAT. $15 is overpriced for a Sundae...but the place is fun. I would come back. Make a reservation because the place got packed while we were there.
I don't get what's all the hype about.... . I went there for brunch with my family..we waited for an hour.. . Our waitress was super rude that made me wanna punch her (of course I did not!). My friend told me to try their hot dog, but they didn't have it during the brunch time. So if you want to try the hot dog, just order at the express/to-go outside.. . . I would not want to waste my time waiting for this place again..
The frozen hot chocolate is good, but not great. Reminds me of the mocha frappuchinos I used to get from Baskin Robbins as a kid. . . Pricey, but worth it if you're in sweltering heat at the Las Vegas strip.
I only came here because everyone acts like it's so great. . . 3 words: waste of money. . Over $20 for 1 frozen hot chocolate and 1 white frozen hot chocolate. . . Honestly they aren't that great. A regular old milkshake is a 100 times better. . . We could only finish about half of our drinks before it got way too sweet and had to throw it out.
This review is only for their frozen hot chocolate.  We didn't try any of their other food.  Everyone was hyping it to me, but quite honestly, it's a $12 Frosty.  Tasted exactly like a chocolate milkshake, and frankly we both weren't that impressed.  It's ok, but not worth the hype and definitely not worth the price!
A bottle of water cost me 7 dollars here. SEVEN DOLLARS.. . I'm sure everything is delicious or whatever but SEVEN DOLLARS. wtf.
Great customer service, fun specialty drinks and menu items but way overpriced. Great view so I guess that's what you're paying for.
Just ok.  Its a basic place with normal american food... salad, pastas, burgers, etc.  Good if you don't know where to go or appreciate your large chain restaurants.  . . I'm not crazy about their desserts... too sweet without any excitement.  However, its in a great location so if you're walking around the strip its a great place to have a late night snack.  . . I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you nearby... its easy and convenient.
The food here is yummy! Grilled cheese sandwich is my favorite. It's a big, thick sandwich I can only eat 1/2....then it's left overs! Their potato skins are delicious, along with their cold hot chocolate....they have a great size to share with a friend. Few times I've been it has always been busy. I have gotten in quicker with reservations ahead of time. It's best to valet on the side (off of Flamingo, VIP valet)  of Ceasar's & you have a short walk thru the hotel to the outside. There's a lot of people watching around the area. One time I'm going to ask to sit outside that faces the strip side. They have lots of sweet treats to try, but by the time I'm done with my main meal I'm too full to order one. I've been lucky to try someone else's for a taste! Everything I've had is delicious. They also have a tiny gift shop on the wall of things you can buy...,..including their cold, hot chocolate! It's def worth the price & trip to try them out! The menu is huge!!!!
I feel like everyone has to go to serendipity at least once to say they've been there. The offerings here are alright, but not worth the price. We came for dessert only (didn't see any need to try their savory offerings given what I read on yelp) and it was alright. Nothing extraordinary, but definitely a fun experience to check off my Vegas to-do list.. . Frozen hot chocolate is exactly what you'd expect and fun to share with all your girlfriends. The sundaes are pretty hefty as well, the lookie lookie gimme cookie sundae was pretty yummy. . . I think if I ever go again it'd be out of convenience.
I only come here for the frozen hot chocolate. There is usually a long line so be prepared to wait, especially on the weekends and summer time. . I like that they have a to go window, makes life easier. . I've had the food here too, but I think I'll stick to the ice cream and frozen hot chocolate. The food is ok, not the best thing. . I usually eat somewhere else, a nice high end restaurant. Afterwards, I'll stroll into this place and have dessert! . They're in the middle of a renovation, it's March 22, 2014, so maybe by this summer they'll be better equipped to handle the summer time volume.
It is over priced... Staffs are not friendly and all foods are salty as typical buffet restaurant.. The Makino provides much better service and food.. Very dissapointed....
So i went to this place for my birthday... my expectations were set high and sadly it did not meet. I assumed the meals would be large in portions and the prices to me neutral but was the complete opposite. The food was not that good especially for the prices. I did enjoy the decor though! ALSO the "frozen hot chocolate" was a let down i expected different.
Every time I've been to Serendipity 3 I am very pleased with my food. Last time I was there, I got a veggie burger and fries. Their frozen hot chocolate is delicious and big enough to share with a couple people.
I got that one sandwich on a huge baguette with steak and 3 sunny side up eggs. Like... how can you go wrong? It was delicious, then again I'm an egg slut so anything eggy gets me whet. (my appetite, sickos) anyways, frozen hot chocolate is always a winner, how can you say no? But it's a tourist trap, so beware. The food there is not really terrible, but it's not great.  If I were to go again, I'd just eat before hand and just get the frozen drink!
The first and best frozen hot chocolate I've ever had! :). . My friends and I lined up for the take-out line and did not sit at the restaurant. Ordered the frozen hot chocolate, but it took a while for them to make it! :(. . Anyways, the frozen hot chocolate was AMAZING. It is basically what the name is.. cold and refreshing version of a hot chocolate with whipped cream and tiny chocolate chips!. . Will be back again.... but the price is kinda ehh... $11?
I have been looking forward to trying this place for a long time now. And with a girl trip to Vegas for my birthday, what better place to go to have my birthday dessert. . . What a huge mistake!! It was by far the worst service I have ever had and what makes it so bad is we only had dessert. First off, we waited about 20 minutes for our waiter to take our drink order, then another 10 for that to be served to us and then another 30 minutes for our desserts to come out. To top it off the dessert wasn't even that amazing. But what made it such a bad experience, I mean enough for me to write a review because I don't ever write reviews but this one I couldn't let go. The wait staff, they were horrible, no customer service skills what so ever. As we're sitting there waiting for our bill, the waiter finally comes to give it to us. Then sitting there waiting for him to take it, we see him clearing off other tables and taking dishes to the back and he doesn't come back out. So I flag a waiter down and ask him if he could get out waiter, which he said he would. Still no sign of him. So I finally walk up front to the hostess and ask him can we please pay our bill, we've been sitting there waiting for 30 minutes. He says he will get our waiter. Still no sign. Then we ask another waiter and finally he takes our bill to the back and gives it to our server. Finally 10 minutes he walks out with our credit card slips. Guess what bud no tip for you!! That was by far the worst experience in a restaurant that I have ever had!!! Never again will I go there or allow any of my family or friends to go there either
TERRIBLE service! We love the atmosphere and the food here, but I have to say, they are the WORST staff I've experienced in all of Las Vegas. The first time we went, we had good service that turned bad once our waiter found out we weren't eating, just having the frozen hot chocolate ($15). (We were no longer worth his time.) Then the 2nd time we went in a group, all eating and drinking. Well first of all, one in our group tried to order a Cherry Limeade, and the waitress said "no, we don't have those". I suggested to her that perhaps her bartender could make one since it's only soda water, lime juice and cherry syrup. She looked at me like I was nuts, and didn't even offer to ask the bartender. We sat there in awkward silence until the person who tried to order it said, that's ok, I'll have a Cherry Pepsi instead. THEN I noticed that each time any of us got up from our table to walk the LONG journey to the disgusting outdoor/public bathrooms, whenever there was a clogged/crowded walkway through the restaurant, the STAFF would push through first and not let the customer walk through first. It's common courtesy to let others walk through a small space before you, and when you're the staff and a customer is waiting to get through, you should let the customer through first. I found many of the staff to be very rude in this way. They would even drop doors on the faces of their customers when going out to the patio. I have really never seen so many rude staff members in one establishment before. We also waited forever for our food which was served one person/plate at a time, and then waited forever for our waitress to deal with our check. She was also very rude about us splitting the bill on different credit cards. I was really disappointed in this experience because I really love the food there. I'm now not sure I'd go back.
This place doesn't really have good food but I only come here for dessert. They always have a long line so you can just go to the take out window and order to go. I love the frozen hot chocolate. I tried the Oreo one but it wasn't that good so I recommend just getting the regular plain frozen hot chocolate.
