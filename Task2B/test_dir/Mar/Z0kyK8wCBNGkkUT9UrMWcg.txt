All the hype about Del Frisco's made me think I was going to have a better steak than Mastro's... It didn't live up to the hype. The ambiance of the restaurant was nice and cozy. We went around the holidays so everything was decorated for Christmas. They had a live piano which was also a nice touch. The food was just OK. The Shanghai-Style Fried Calamari was drenched in a sweet chili glaze, and was super salty. I ordered a bone in ribeye, medium rare plus, per the usual. The flavor of the steak was good, but still not as good as Mastros. It also came out medium rare, a lil too rare for my liking. Other friends at the table also had to get their steaks reheated. Kind of odd?? We ordered sides: potato au gratin, corn, and creamed spinach. All the sides were typical sides, nothing special. At the end they gave us a slice the lemon cake (we were celebrating a birthday), and I would have to say that the lemon cake probably stole the show. The cake was super moist, and the frosting was a lil tart and perfect texture. The service was good. I think our waiter was in training because the manager was following him everywhere, but I think he did just fine. Overall, I'm glad I got to try it... But for the same price, I think I'll stick with Mastro's.
SUPERB customer service.. . Came here for steak of course, but I got bacon on demand here. I was being a drunk idiot and they still provided excellent customer service.. . To the waiter's name I forgot. Thanks for running out and giving me the order of bacon I jokingly asked for you. You my bro, bro.
We love this place when we come to Las Vegas.  Highly recommended for the steaks!
This is my go-to place for the best ribeye in town. The staff is always on point and making sure everything is to our liking. The place isn't cheap so to have staff constantly checking on us makes it worth the price for the ribeyes.
The atmosphere is that of a typical American steakhouse with large portions, where side dishes tend to outshine entrees. It's a solid choice for a classic steakhouse, but if your focus is the beef, there is better to be had elsewhere in town. The meat may be good, but lacks the intense beefy flavor of other meat-centric spots that have their own aging program (or source from others that do). If prime is all you need, this place will hit the mark. If you're looking for the best dry-aged or wagyu you'll need to look elsewhere.. . It was a long meal that took much longer than it should have. Luckily I was in good company. My wife and I (along with out son) were celebrating our wedding anniversary. It was nice of the staff to acknowledge the occasion when we checked in and when we were seated. It was also a nice touch when they presented a card from the staff. At the end of the meal the lemon cake was complimentary. It was a good experience throughout for the most part, but there were enough misses or lowpoints that made it less than perfect.. . Steaks are pretty good and side dishes will steal the show. The creamed corn was plenty creamy with bits of bacon sprinkled throughout. The potatoes au gratin were my favorite side dish. Large chunks of potatoes filled the dish, accompanied by lots of ham, bacon, and cheese, making it rich and delicious. The true highlight, however, was the crab cake appetizer. By far it was the best crab cake I've had in town. Little to no filler, seasoned just enough to compliment the sweetness of the meat, and a cajun sauce that added a slight tinge of heat and depth.The low point of the night was trying their steak tartare. It was basically minced meat with very little seasoning. It's in the running for one of the worst dishes I've had. . . Despite that awful appetizer, it was a good night. The company, obviously, was top notch, as was the service. And, there were enough good dishes to make this an enjoyable dining experience.
I went to Del Frisco's last night because I had never been to one.  I was starving after a long flight.  I sat at the bar and had a lemon drop where the simple syrup used was way too sweet.  The Caesar salad was good (but did have a leaf with the red stuff in it) and the steak tips, because I was traveling and couldn't eat a whole steak.  I thought this would be a good way to taste the "exceptional" food this restaurant had to offer.  I was wrong.  I know it was a low end dish, but each steak tip almost broke my teeth because they were only grissel (sp?).  In fact, there was bone in one of them.  I wasn't asked how my meal was until after I was done.  For my second drink I asked for less lemon and that didn't  happen.  The reason I'm giving two stars is that it was fun to watch the bartender at work.  There are so many other choices in Vegas--when I come back I will go somewhere else.
Best place for a steak in Las Vegas.  Eat here, and stay away from those trendy places on the Strip..... . We held our wedding reception here. All our Guests had nothing but great things to say about it.. . First, Heather, the Banquets Manager, was the best. On top of everything, and gave us the best value in compared to the Palm, Mc Cormick and Schmeck, and other private rooms we priced out.. . All but three of our guests, had steaks and were raving. The other three had Chicken, Tuna, and Salmon, and were pleased. Great sides, mashed potatoes, were the best, great service.. . It's very rare that Wedding Banquet Food can be ordered off a menu, and get the quality you would expect during regular dinning time. . . Best Filet I have ever eaten in Las Vegas!!!!. . You can tell the staff appreciates and wants your patronage. . . This is my new place for all special occasions. . . Read my review of The Palm, and then eat here!!!
Here's the deal. When visiting any steakhouse, I don't dick around with any pee wee hockey puck filets or some half assed fish deal. I don't even require a menu. Bring me your biggest Prime Bone-In Ribeye. Cook it medium rare, and don't fuck it up. . . I'm basically a Vegas local and have had the BiR at Prime, Delmonico's, Carnevino, Gallagher's, Gordan Ramsey's, The Golden Steer, and Vic & Anthony's. V&A has always been my favorite, and I have had it countless times. It's usually our default steakhouse. Tonight, we decided on steaks at the last minute and couldn't get in at V&A in a timely fashion, so we just whipped into Del Frisco's and sat at the bar. . . Other than V&A, I'm not a big fan of going to a "chain" joint in a town like LV with all its' great options, but The BiR at Del Frisco's is simply one of the best I have ever had. Served on a super hot plate, juicy, tender and flavor that knocked my socks off. Service from Trish was nothing short of phenomenal. $150 plus $50 tip for 2 BiR, baked potatoes, iced teas. Definitely going back.
My second visit to Del Frisco's, only a few months apart. I was super satisfied on my first visit, and I wanted to come back and tackle on the 32 ounce Wagyu steak. . . I learned my lesson last time by ordering all these appetizers, so I skipped it this time just so I can focus on the steak. And that Wagyu steak can deliver!!! Overall, a great experience, but I had a slightly better affinity to the 22 ounce bone in rib eye on my last visit.. . At $90 a plate, the Wagyu steak is one of those where you can order once in your life, be satisfied, then go back to your favorite. Don't get me wrong, still a great steak and I will definitely come back to Del's, but I'll probably go back to the rib eye or try another steak.. . I still devoured that steak, minus the bone, it came to about 26 ounces of meat. And I went for their lemon cake. That cake was so moist. My server this time was Tinae. She was superb and I wish her well on her school and studies.. . They said that they're opening up a Del's in Santa Monica. I'll be one of the first to visit that place and order me their finest steaks.
Being hungover all day and eating a steak sucked. Meat was delicious.
We absolutely loved the steaks (and the sides)!. . The bone-in wagyu ribeye was incredibly juicy and melt-in-your-mouth amazing! My friend had the bone-in filet mignon that was also semi-orgasmic!  The sides that we chose complimented the meal extremely well: lobster mac-and-cheese, mushrooms, and scalloped potatoes.  Everything was prepared perfectly, and I can't wait to go back the next time we're in Vegas!
OUTSTANDING!!! I'm a steak person, and I eat at about 4 steakhouses a week. (I'm from Louisiana...town call Golden Meadow  a Cajun community.) I fly to Las Vegas every other week, and I try to hit at least 2 steakhouses every trip. I've been flying here 11 years, and I must admit Las Vegas is stepping up to the plate with the food industry. Now...Del Frisco's has been on my list for a while, but we never got around to. I really screwed up...I could have been eating in here for 11yrs. Just think of all that great meat I missed lol. I had a Tomahawk Ribeye...UNBELIEVABLE!!! Of course it's a little pricy $90. My better half had a filet as well was GREAT! Service Great, atmosphere Great! The whole over all experience was to my upmost satisfaction! Also, all the appetizers were great! So, when you come to Vegas, ask about this place...you won't be disappointed!!! . Buddy
The steak was amazing. Had the 8 oz medium done. The waiter was very polite as well as the rest of the employees. I came in dressed in jeans and tennis shoes and I felt somewhat under dressed, but they made me feel right at home. The VIP drink is also amazing. We spent 150.00 bucks for 2 but so worth it! Will be back next time in Vegas
Best steak in town.
Way over- priced!!!  I just can't see how you can gauge customers $67.00 for 16oz steak with a bone!?!  There is no justification even if the steaks came from golden steers!  Don't fall for the con-job, there is no beef on the planet that warrants Del Friscos prices.  I left hungry any pennyless.
