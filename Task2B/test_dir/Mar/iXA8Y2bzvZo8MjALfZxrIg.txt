The nachos are the best, burgers are tasty and the drinks are cold.  It was a blistering hot day so all 6 of us in our party ordered waters to go along with the adult beverages.  The water was awful, tasted like they got it from the pool.  I know this is not the place to go for water but it would've been nice to get a little hydration in before venturing out into 115 degrees.  The waitress couldn't get my order straight for the life of her.  I was the first to order; a draft bud light, a glass of water and a black and bleu burger.  She brought everyone their water, except me. Brought me bottled beer after I asked for draft. The food was served, I didn't get anything.  The food runner had to take my order prior to leaving the table.  No apologies from the waitress for anything just that it would be a few more minutes. I'd come back for the food but not the service.
Good margarita but I don't know if I would pay for drinks if I can get them for free wen I gamble
Margaritaville seemed like the perfect choice after listening to country music for 3 hours while beginning Vegas with your partner in crime from Tennessee. I love my country music, but Margaritaville is a bit outdated. Decor didn't seem all that realistic, and the Volcano wasn't very impressive. . . Food-wise, nothing stood out. Burgers, quesadillas, and the famous mountainous nachos. The nachos are definitely hefty, I'll give you that, but then again you might not want to remember after downing pepto bismol. They have a wide range of margarita flavors, and you can even get the huge souvenir glass, which will only gather dust sitting on that already cluttered shelf at home, for around $35! Yes, it comes with the alcohol, but that just sounds insane to me. Maybe I was still warming up to Vegas prices, but I prefer getting my margaritas from Fat Tuesday, where you can get 48oz of an Everlear concoction for a fraction of that price. More bang for your buck for sure. . . I can only stand so much of watching Jimmy Buffet in concert at the beach, so unfortunately this was a no-go for me. In their defense, I hear it's a lot more lively at night, and there are performers at the restaurant. Otherwise, please skip! There are way too many better restaurants at Vegas! Unless of course you are one of those half naked people at the Jimmy Buffet concert and want to relive those days.
Great atmosphere and even better nachos! Probably the best nachos in Vegas! There is a mountain of chips covered in cheese, nacho cheese, guacamole, sour cream, jalapeno's and more cheese! Definitely can share between 2-4 people. The service was great and it'll be a staple place for me every time I visit Las Vegas.
The nachos do look amazing but their burgers suck.  Not $15 worth.  You can get a better burger at Dennys.  The atmosphere is fun especially if drinking.  Would come back to try the nachos but not anything else.
Props to our waitress, Marcie, from this past week's visit. She is on point with her drink recommendations. She's spunky, attentive, quick, and funny. Should've stuck with her drink reco's on the second round. Sorry, Marcie!
Had a great dinner here on our first night in Vegas (03/14/14). There was a wait but only because the top, outside area was reserved for a private party, if not I'm sure we would of been seated right away. Place was packed but we waited longer to be seated than to get our food. Fast and good service. Drinks and burgers were delicious!! Ate here again right before kitchen closing time the next day (closes at 1 a.m.) and menu options are limited at that time but still great food. They had an awesome band playing, people dancing and just a great atmosphere.
Great Bar with your usual upgraded bar food.  The food is not 5 star cuisine expertly prepared by a chef that has a manicure and a show on Food Network, but it is actually not that bad.  Margaritaville has amazing drinks, great service, and great atmosphere.  That is why you go here.  You do not really go for the food.  . . That would be like visiting Hooters for the wings.. That would be like going to church to pick up chicks.. That would be like going to a funeral to pick up chicks.. That would be like admitting yourself in the hospital for the free tongue depressers.. That would be like drinking whiskey out of a wine glass (you just look stupid).. That would be like going early to a Stones concert and Michael Bolton is the opening act.. That would be like going to a library to practice drums.. That would be like going to a petting zoo on the first date.. That would be like bringing your laptop on a 3 hour cruise.. That would be like shaving your body in the winter.. That would be like getting married when she isn't even mad at you.. That would be like curtain shopping at Bed Bath and Beyond and expecting it not to suck.. That would be like going to Amsterdam and having a job interview with drug test the day after you come home.. . ....don't expect the food to be mind-blowing, just enjoy the bar atmosphere for what it is.
Gets three stars for the theme and the fact that the volcano show here in Vegas is well over the top of what I have seen in other locations. The food is pretty consistent from location to location -- the nachos are a huge starter and the fish tacos were good enough to make me happy. I really enjoyed the Blueberry Pomegranate Margarita!. . On the down side it was the twilight zone at the check in desk. Not friendly at all. Also, the Flamingo itself (where the Margaritaville Casino and Restaurant are housed) needs a good implosion remodel when you compare it to nearly everything else in the immediate area.
Nachos was big and good... good for sharing.. me and my boyfriend shared one but just ate half of it even.. it's like $16
We met my uncle for a late unch at Margaritaville.  It was cute and touristy!  We had the pomegranate margaritas on the rocks. They tasted pretty good, but the glasses they were served in were just plain drinking glasses.  Not impressive for the price.. . We had the land shark battered cod, fries and coleslaw.  The cod was AMAZING!!!!!!  Although a bit pricey, it was a huge helping of fish. So good!!!!!  The fries were not very good and the coleslaw had cilantro and lime in it, which sounded interesting, but just tasted weird,   All in all, it is worth an occasional visit.
i love this place, great drinks and food... awesome entreatment
Like everything in Las Vegas, Margaritaville is a dining escape in and of itself.  Compelling decor ripped right from the legendary Jimmy Buffet songs give you a change in latitude from the moment you walk in.   This large restaurant manages an intimate feel through themed areas throughout.  Live entertainment from enthusiastic performers entertain without offending... this is someplace where Bachelorette Parties and Families will feel equally at home. . . Do not miss the Volcano Nachos which are nearly a meal in andof themselves.  We shared the Coconut Shrimp and the Fish Tacos; both were fresh and satisfying. . . We loved being able to sample the 4 Margaritas before settling in on the Mango and a Classic.. . But what sets this restaurant apart from other restaurants on the strip, is the gracious hospitality.  This staff is having fun!  And they want you to have fun!   There's absolutely not a hint of arrogance or the you're-not-cool-enough-to-eat-here vibe that's so common on the Las Vegas Strip.
