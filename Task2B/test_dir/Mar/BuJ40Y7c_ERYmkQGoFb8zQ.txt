This place is where I've been staying the past few times I came to Vegas. Mostly because I love there rooms and sports book. The payouts are the most on the strip and the best I've seen in Vegas or anywhere for that matter. My lady likes it here to gamble and we always stay for free.
We had lunch at the bar in the Beach Cafe today. The burgers were outstanding and the wine was badly needed after a long day of travel. The bartender was great with super service and a friendly conversation and a wealth of information. Hope we have time to go back on this trip.
The rooms are as nice as any in Vegas and considerably larger.. Every one is Hilton friendly and that is usually enough for me.. I had dinner at Biscayne and it was wonderful.. I will be back for sure
I can't believe there is a hotel that still charges for internet. And at that it is $10 for only 5MB. . . Rooms are dated and sort of clean. . . Bathrooms have a weird shower setup. . . Did I mention they charge for internet?? Even after being a diamond member and paying a $20 resort fee.
Booked last minute trip to Vegas via Hotwire and got Tropicana. At first I was skeptical based on some reviews plus I usually stay at the Aria but it turned out okay.. . The rooms are renovated and have a comfortable bed and decent room space. For the price you pay it was definitely worth it plus easy access to both MGM and the strip.. . Wouldn't be against staying here again. I recommend the closest tower to the hotel lobby and as any other hotel yes there is a "hotel fee"  but nothing out of the ordinary. . . Checked in around 2am, just call ahead and give them a heads up
It's much better than the old run down Tropicana, but still not up to par with the rest of the strip at 4 star level.  The bathrooms tub, grouting, etc. was still old.  The rooms where okay.  Nothing to rant and rave about.  The location is great and that's what your pretty much paying for.
I think my only two complaints are:. 1. My room number was marked, but not what tower I was in.  So I ended up going to the wrong tower before asking.. 2. As with all Vegas hotels, no coffee maker!?  Sheesh.. P.S. The tv remote for my room didn't work.. . I never stayed here prior to the remodeling so my first impression is "well, this is pretty nice".  No big chain restaurants here, which is cool because you can explore...but it sucks when you're pressed for time and just need to buy an over priced subway sandwich or whatever.
Wow, I thought the place had been significantly improved. However the rooms were significantly smaller and less modern then a better priced Palazzo or Venetian.  Tidy but something you would expect from a $70 a night comfort inn..Do yourself a favor and don't use Priceline for Las Vegas if you are not sure of where you must be.  If you do purchase cancellation insurance, and if you get the Tropicanalook for an excuse to pull the pin.
We arrived for a convention and were "upgraded" by Rose to the Bungalows(a complete misnomer, closer to the casino, but, definitely not bungalows).   But, we were told that it was an upgrade so, we were pleased.  The rooms were fine, nothing spectacular, but fine.. . Until we returned to our rooms later in the evening and they were sweltering.  (It was February, and it was unseasonably warm.)  I have MS, and heat totally exacerbates symptoms.  We called and asked how to turn on the A/C (thinking that we had already done so before we went out for the evening).  We were told that the A/C was not working, and that there were no available rooms.   Miraculously, the next morning at 9 they had a lovely room in the tower.  Great views from here, except they have these weird screen like things tht make you feel a little like you're in prison.  And it wasn't there the night before, but it was all set and ready to move into at 9 the next morning?  Right.. . So-so rooms and dreadful customer service.. . And,yes, I could make this an ADA issue, but, while I have MS, unless I am over heated, I am disables by it at all.
I wish there was an option for no stars at all. This is absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. I would rather have stayed at motel 6. Not only was our room not ready on time- they didn't even have the correct room booked for us! We were told we would be notified in about 20 minutes when our room was ready. Well 2 hours later and we still haven't gotten a call. I had to call them myself and when I finally did get my room key the staff was defensive and argumentative with me about how they were " trying to help".  I honestly felt insulted the I tore time I dealt with the staff- they made me feel incredibly unwanted and unwelcome. Clearly they were NEVER trained on handling customer issues. . The decor is dated and the staff is absolutely impossible, the manager of the cafe seems to be the only person with a brain in their head- he should run the entire hotel and teach the rest of the staff a thing or two about customer service and running a business. This place ruined my birthday and to be quite honest I wish I stayed home! Was not worth the hassle!
If the Tropicana were placed basically anywhere but in Las Vegas, it could potentially be a 4 star hotel.  But because it's located right on the Vegas strip, it loses its allure against all the glitz and glamour.. . This joint recently underwent a remodel, and while there's nothing special about the casino or rooms, they're clean (a necessity for me no matter where I go).  The two annoying things about my room are that my sink/tub soap was not always refilled and someone left a dirty hand towel hanging on the shower curtain rod that housekeeping must have missed (for God knows how long). . . Bottom line, would I return?  While Tropicana wouldn't be my first choice, if the price were right (or even free like on this sweet visit), sure - why not?  Plus I'm a sucker for a complimentary warm chocolate chip cookie (upon check-in, you'll get a coupon - two if you sweet talk the front desk!).
Pros. --free cookies at check in. --convenient starbucks. --well-priced. --ability to drop off your luggage until your rooms are ready and post-check out/pre airport.. --Biscanye is delicious, and the wait staff is fantastic.. --Very clean, renovated rooms, nicely tucked away from a lot of the noise on the strip.. . . Cons:. --The staff in the business office were incredibly rude when we were awaiting the arrival of a guest's passport after her wallet was stolen the night before.  They were almost mocking the situation, which only made a stressful situation worse.. . --2/3 of the rooms we stayed in had charges on them that we did not make.  The first was $150, and the second was around $40. They removed them when we disputed the charges because we had never visited the establishments they came from.  While they waived the resort fee in one of the rooms, the other didn't receive similar treatment.  Perhaps, their mistakes only count if they are over $100.. . --We were told our rooms would be ready at 2pm when we arrived early at 10am, so we went to do some exploring of the strip.  We came back at 2:45, not ready--have to wait until 3-5pm. At 4pm, 2/3 of the rooms were ready. Finally, at 5:10pm, after being told we would be called when the rooms were ready, we go to the desk. Suddenly, the rooms are available.. . . Pool-specific:. --They don't allow you to BYOB at the pool, or any snacks, yet they don't enforce it once you're inside the pool area.  So, if you can conceal your snacks and booze, go for it.. . --most of the pool was closed off during our stay, and it closes at 6pm.  This is las vegas, pools and hot tubs should probably be open after hours--even if it's just from 21+ residents, or if the pool bar ran some sort of happy hour. . --Note to the pool management: if you leave the bar menus around the lounge chairs, you'll get more impulse buys.
