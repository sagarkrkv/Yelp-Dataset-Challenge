Rating is based on service though food was bland. Restaurant was not busy yet we had to ask the busboy who our waiter was. I couldn't tell you one thing about this establishment. Waitress was disinterested and unfriendly. We let the manager know about the service and he offered us a house meal on our next visit. However, we declined. I would not eat at this restaurant again. . . I had the fish and chips which was bland. Girlfriend had the chicken pot pie which was decent. Would not recommend.
Definitely a fun place when you're hungover and need a place to get you ready for round 3 or 4.. . . They have a bloody mary that is served with a mini slider... super delicious.  The slider is perfect. They also have a tasty mini pastrami which is equally great. The fires are right on. . . Its fun. . Its easy. . Its tasty.
Loved the food!  Started with the Belgian beer flight.  All the beers were delicious.  Try the Moscow Mules, they were also delicious.  The lobster rolls, crab cakes, brisket on fried potato cakes and Asian duck on buns were phenomenal.  Carved turkey, lamb, roast beef and corn beef were served with an assortment of toasted breads and sauces.  Everything was wonderful but I enjoyed the corn beef and turkey the best.  Onto dessert.  We had sticky toffee pudding which was great.  However the bread pudding was the best i have ever had.  Great service and great food.  Pricey? Yes, but that's Vegas.  That's the way it is.
We were brought here before a big night out, so we knew it was time to fuel up. We had a group of 5 and were seated promptly. The place was busy, so there was a few hiccups in getting our waiters attention, but it was nothing major. . . I ordered the fish and chips. It was good, but the fish wasn't as crispy as I would've expected it to be. Everyone eyed my one friend jealously, she ordered the lobster roll and raved about it. If I ever have the chance to go back, I would definitely opt for that. As far as prices go, I felt it pretty well priced for what you got. Over all good experience.
Stopped in here for lunch. Obviously a really great location if you're staying in the area of Aria. It's a good option for something a little more casual, as a lot of the other options in and directly around the casino are more upscale.. . With it being right on the walkway from Aria towards the mall and Cosmo beyond, it's a solid place to watch the crowd go by, which in Vegas, can always be entertaining. . . The P.U.B. (Public Urban Bar) has, as one would expect and hope, a pretty outstanding selection of beers, both on tap and in bottle. We were served by the barkeep very promptly, and as we were fairly starving after a long flight, it fortunately did not take long to get our food.. . I tried the Buffalo Style Burger which was served with blue cheese, hot sauce and slaw. Really outstanding. Their fries were great too. . . At $18 for a burger, it's definitely on the pricier side, but what else would you expect right outside the casino door? If I get the opportunity, I'll head back here for some more brews and snacks, though I'd probably try to hit up the happy hour to keep the cost contained.
I came to Todd English PUB after a lunch at Smith and Wollensky. So I wouldn't normally be down in this area. I felt the place overall was overpriced. I like the decor and the menu was plentiful but overpriced non the less. . I came for happy hour which gave some relief on the drink prices but a side of fries was $9. I had their sangria which is basically wine with a little bit of peach at the bottom. I wouldn't go out of my way to venture here again.
My review is for brunch though after my amazing meal, i can only imagine how good the rest of the menu is.. The service was attentive.  The waitress gave us each a Make-Your-Own Bloody Mary sheet and explained it.  I ordered one with bacon and Old Bay and it was freaking amazing.  A friend ordered a totally different one and it was equally amazing yet totally different.  If you love bloody marys, this is the place!. I ordered the Chilaquiles and my boyfriend had the biscuits and gravy (which comes with a frosty pint of PBR).  Both dishes were awesome and the portions are huge.  Our friends ordered the quiche and the french toast... both also awesome.  The best was the "side" of bacon that was ordered.  It was more like an entire PACK of bacon.  There had to have been at least 15 strips on the plate... which if you love bacon, is defintiely not an issue. . The prices are on par for Vegas and for a higher end brunch.  The outside seating right outside of Aria is nice.  SInce it is recessed from the sidewalk on the strip, it's quieter than sitting, say at Diablo's or on the patio of Mon Ami Gabi.. I cannot wait to visit again and try the happy hour and lunch/dinner menu.  We still cannot stop talking about this brunch!
Fun and cool pub right inside the Aria!. . The Pub burger and lobster sandwich was great.. . Beer selection is strong, although I expected a bit more.  . . Overall, fun place to eat at and enjoy a cold beer!
Food was really good. Tuna burger was to die for! Lobster roll and oysters! Was really good  i would recommend this place the only thing why i didn't like about this restaurant was the servers were not good at all. After i told our server my order and i actually wasn't done with the menu she saw that i was still reading it and she grabbed it from me. I told her i wasn't done with the menu! That just didn't make me wanna visit the place again.
Great experience! Drinks are delicious but a bit pricy at $14-16 per cocktail but it is Vegas...the Lobster rolls were loaded with lobster great dish! The roasted chicken pot pie was not your traditional pie the filling was too cheesy for my taste and the biscuit topping was dense and lacking that flakey texture you expect. Perfect place for large groups. . Oysters are fresh and the house made horseradish sets em off! $2 each. Hostess seemed highly stressed was very short with us. Our waitress however was very friendly and attentive.
Checked out this place on a recommendation from a family member who eats at this place whenever they come to Las Vegas. . . The food wasn't bad, but definitely was over priced. The staff is pretty friendly, and the environment wasn't too shabby either. Unless you feel like spending $15-$20 for appetizers, I would pass...
If you're looking for a casual but still delicious place to eat before a night out (or a night in, but since we're talking about Vegas a night in just doesn't make sense), then TE PUB is the place! Went here with some co-workers and we sat at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and helpful with the menu since we were from out of town. She suggested Lobster Rolls so we went with Lobster Rolls. She hit the nail on the head. Lobster Rolls were freaking fantastic. So incredibly good and a good deal for the price tag too. As far as beer goes - they have everything. I had a free beer from checking in on Yelp which the bartender seemed a little peeved about (psh! is all I have to say), but the experience was still worth going back for. Again...get the Lobster Rolls. You won't regret it.
Amazing beer selection. Nicest bar we found the whole time I was in Vegas. Also if you can drink a beer in less than 7 seconds it's free. Great American food and excellent staff! If I ever go to Vegas again, I will definitely come back.
This is my go to spot every time me and my friends go to Vegas. The atmosphere is great and the food is delicious! Even though the majority of us get the same thing every time we come, which is the LOBSTER ROLLS! Best lobster roll I've ever had, they aren't stingy with the amount of lobster and the rolls they use are to die for. Warm buttery goodness. I would definitely recommend people to come here and be the judge for themselves and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
I came here the weekend of my 21st birthday and I honestly don't think I've ever encountered better service. Our server was sweet and her recommendations on what to order were delicious! We ended up getting the mac and cheese and mini corn dogs for appetizers. The mac and cheese is phenomenal! I split a lobster roll with my friends which was bomb as well. The bartender overheard that it was my birthday and he treated us to a round of shots.  And I guess you get a free ice cream sandwich when it's your birthday, yum! Overall it was a great experience and I'm definitely coming back to try their happy hour menu and drinks. Couldn't really manage the first time because we were too hungover.
Came with friends on St. Patrick's Day to enjoy some craft beers.  If you check in with Yelp you get a free Bud Light.  You can also get up to 2 free beers ($10 or less) if you are brave enough to chug them in under the time allowed by the bar top hourglass (7ish seconds).  Happy hour includes half priced pints which run around $5-$8.  You can also get $1 wings and deals on sliders/oysters.  Our female bartender was very friendly and made sure we were having a good time!
Highs: quality food, good service, some decent happy hour prices . Lows: tiny portions at high prices
Well the wife and I have been to Todd English Pub on about 5 or 6 occasions. Overall, the pros are their happy hours, when draft beer and wines by the glass are half price. They also have some food specials during happy hour. It's also a pretty happening place, because people from everywhere flock to get cheap craft beer on the Strip.. . The decor is nice and sitting at the bar is my preferred choice if it's available. As a whole, I have never been excited about the food here. The service is great, but other than the raw oysters and the fries, nothing really stands out as far as food. My other pet peeve is that they don't really replace their beers when they kick, unless they have another keg of the same beer. Invariably, I wind up ordering a few beers only to find out that they are out of it. . . Oh well, cheap beer on the Strip is still cool, but I will likely eat elsewhere.
