I haven't eaten here yet , been standing in a short line for over 30 minutes.  It's like a god damn night club with the velvet rope bouncer letting a couple people in every 10 minutes.  If the food is any good I'll update the rating.. . Update:. So we finally got seated, seems like the worst buffet line system ever.Just like a nightclub, keeping the line long so it looks busy, but plenty of room inside.. . The food selection was very good, seems to have more than a lot of the hotels on the strip.  Lunch was $15.99 and during our time there they changed over to dinner so we got dinner at the lunch price.. . The good stuff: pork ribs, sliders, buffalo chicken slider, Chinese pork ribs, Kalbi ribs, beef brisket, chicken wings.  Others in our group liked the shrimp and crawfish.. . Dessert: peanut butter gelato, creme brulee, espresso, cappuccino.. . They had root beer on tap which was pretty good and something I haven't seen before at a buffet.  Wine and beer we're also available.. . Overall way better than the MGM buffet which was pretty bad and $32.99, I got it free and would rather pay for this buffet than eat at MGM for free.. . Other than the insanely long and unnecessary wait to get in it's a good deal.  I will not return because of that reason.
Leaving Las Vegas and heading back to LA, we decided to have our final LV breakfast off the strip.  We stopped on that section of I-15S, where the last main strip of businesses try to draw you in, before you drive into the world of "nothing" for the next 30 minutes.  . . I heard a lot about Studio B, and apparently it was a great and affordable buffet option that a lot of locals go to.  . . It was GREAT!!!  We were seated promptly in a beautiful room with a large breakfast buffet.  It was a bright, open, and well designed space.  The prices are amazing for the selection given, and the service was also friendly.. . We ate at the Monte Carlo, MGM and here for buffets on this trip.  Although it didn't quite top MGM, we believe it came ever so very close!  It beat Monte Carlo by a landslide.  . . Definitely try this off-strip treasure!
Our favorite buffet in Vegas. I'll start with the best food--dessert. Make sure you leave room for that even at breakfast. . . They have a huge variety of cuisines: Mexican, American, Chinese, Japanese, Mediterranean, Italian, etc. Even Irish for St. Patrick's. Ha. . . There are healthy options of fruits, vegetables, salads and sugar-free treats. . . We usually don't load up on basics like bread or soup, but there should be several options for anyone. . . Drinks are included with every meal.
I lived in Vegas for 9 years and I know one thing or two about their buffets. This studio B buffet, like everything, was wonderful when they opened their doors. Well, after moving back to California and going back yesterday there, I was disappointed. The food is mediocre at best. Everything has the same taste. This was not seafood night. They have it only on the weekends. But if you taste the pizza, egg rolls, pastas, they all have the same, generic, institution taste food, blah. I tried the eggrolls; crispy on the outside, but the vegetables inside tasted mushy and overcooked. The pizza with cheese and tomato was blah. The dough was bland and the cheese tasted institute-like. I tried the chile relleno; some tasteless cheese inside with half a can of canned tomato sauce thrown on top. The rice has no taste. Now. the dessert section is still holding up pretty good. Desserts are still outstanding,  no complains there. Service is still pretty good.
Don't waste your money. . St. Paddy's "SPECIAL"...... What a joke. . Didn't have most of the advertised specials and what they DID have was tasteless and WAY overpriced. . The corned beef was like a used truck tire. . I should charge them for the dental work I need from trying to chew it. . Waited 30 minutes to be seated when half of the tables were empty. . Should have walked away and saved $50 bucks...... Won't be coming back here....
This buffet has become a staple for thousands of people that venture out to Vegas. I have tried a multitude of buffets in Vegas and I think it's safe to say that Studio B is one of my favorites. I think the price of admission is a steal for the quality and the myriad of food selections they offer, not to mention all-you-can-drink wine and beer! I especially enjoy coming here for their selection of seafood. Their menu hasn't changed much over the past few years and I think they could spice things up and offer new items but I'm not complaining. Be sure to avoid coming here on Sunday morning as the line can get absurdly long.
I always like to end a Vegas trip with a yummy buffet experience. Although I wanted to try the new #1 place Bachanal, the wait on Sunday was almost 2 hours and I didn't feel like waiting. . . I decided to start heading back to California and hit the always reliable Studio B at M Resort. I've eaten here a couple years ago, and I believe it was rated #1 at the time. This was my first time back and I remember why this has to be one of my favorite buffets. I've done Cosmo, Bellagio, Rio, and some of the other buffets and for $40 on the weekend, Studio B can't be beat.. . My friends and I enjoyed the seafood selection, and their prime rib was perfect. We probably ate like 100 oysters. The only section that needs work is their sushi. Great desserts and gelato, along with beer and wine included.. . If you're not looking to spend a lot of money and looking for a great variety of food, go here! On bar with all of the big buffets in Vegas
The food is very good! Waiting lines are expectable. Only downside is that they don't have toast for breakfast. Which I don't understand.. For lunch and diner I would highly recommend this buffet. For breakfast I'd go somewhere else.
Waited over an hour in line just to pay! There was no more than 20 people in line, I don't know what the deal was, since I came last year at the same time and didn't have to wait so freaking long! By the time I got to the cashier they stopped serving lunch and were now charging the dinner price at 2pmish, since the people that paid had to wait in a second line just to get a table. I ended up leaving after an hour, I'm not paying a dinner price at 2pm. It's lunch time people!
For the price, it's good. The food is ok, the sushi is so bad though. The rice is so hard and chewy. Bleh...I do like the Ox Tail soup, the chicken and beef sliders, and prime rib are ok. . We keep coming back because it's relatively cheaper than the high end buffets on the strip. We also like to stop by before we check in to our hotel. . It's easy to get in and out of this place, the line isn't so long, and the parking isn't so bad.
Probably one of the better buffets in Vegas. But maybe just 3 3/4 stars at most. . . Quite a drive away from the strip, but I think it's worth (the drive) it. I remember the days when weekend seafood brunch/dinner was 30ish. My recent visit it was up to 40+ already. Geez. At least there wasn't a line, but that might also be because of the new price point. . . I only really go in for the snow crab legs. They're precut now, sliced in half, so it's a little different. Not as fun and gratifying than cracking the legs and having to work for in in my opinion lol. But it does make it easier. . . They have an awesome dessert bar, most of the desserts are okay - mind you they might have been sitting out for a while. My go-to is usually creme brulee and gelato.
I went yesterday for lunch. I paid $17.00 for the lunch buffet and was surprised by how small it was. At a buffet I like to taste EVERYTHING, by not fixing my plate as if it's my last meal. The only thing I enjoyed was BBQ ribs, mac n cheese, brussels sprouts, mini hoison wings, lo mein, and the beef taquitos. That isn't much for a buffet. I did enjoy the mini creme brulee and mini flourless cake. I hear a lot more excitement about dinner so I'll have to try it next. Lunch....not so grand.
Been here many times. . Great food out of the whole hotel. . The line control and seating could use some work.. The seafood selection isn't like it used to be either. . Still great!
Best buffet I have ever been to!! We'll worth the $40 person. All you can drink beer and wine and my boyfriend loved that. The food was excellent. Tons of variety and every type of meat u can imagine. The crab legs and shrimp we're delicious! Highly recommend and I will definitely be going back
