Ordered: tuna melt, full montagu. . Never disappoints. Quick service, great tasting sandwiches.
It's a sub shop plain and simple. Like a Quiznos or a subway. For about $6.00 you get like a 6 inch subway sub. It's quick and easy.....which is key when you are spendingyour day in the sports book right across the way.
Excellent sandwiches. Nothing to complain about. Perfect "on the way" food to somewhere.
Earl of Sandwich definitely hits the spot after a night of partying! And you can tell that a lot of people would agree too by the looks of the line. You'll probably be waiting at least 20 minutes, but the line goes fast.. . My favorite is the Meatball sandwich. The bread is really good and toasty. They pack the sandwich full of meatballs and marinara sauce, with lots of gooey mozzarella cheese! The meatballs are juicy and the sauce is really flavorful. Mmmm its so warm and delicious in your tummy, especially at 3am, when you're freezing in a cold air-conditioned hotel. Last time, I also got the broccoli cheese soup with my sandwich. It was piping hot and super creamy and delish!. . I've only been to the Vegas location, but they now have one closer to me in Downtown Disney, but I have yet to try it at that location. Time to make a fieldtrip out of it and get some sandwiches before going to Disneyland!
I've eaten here twice because the reviews are so great, and I love a good sandwich. However, both times I wasn't impressed. The service was good, and the food seemed to be okay, but not great. It's better than subway, but I would still prefer a sandwich from jersey mikes over the earl of sandwich. This place is good for a late night bite on the strip, but it's not my first choice during the day.
Don't be afraid of the long lines. It usually goes by quicker than you think! . If you feel like a warm meal, get their sandwiches! They're all so good! There are also wraps available, but these are served cold. The tables usually become available by the time you finish ordering.
Cheap and fast. You can recycle this review for the hookers that hang around the casino bar.
I ordered a small catering batch through this location on the day of my wedding. I had some initial troubles placing my order via phone but everything got settled and they were even able to accommodate my order (10+ sandwiches) and had them ready for me in a matter of an hour. I had some guests with specific requests (no sauce, no tomatoes, etc) and every sandwich was perfect! The sandwiches were delicious and made for a perfect lunch while we were getting ready.
Earl of Sandwich is a good spot for a quick bite at all times of the day. The sandwich and the price were on point, but I don't think it lived up to the hype.
I have eaten here the past 2 years that I have visited Las Vegas and stayed at Planet Hollywood. It's open 24 hours and the menu offers lots of variety!. . I had the Earl's club - but instead of the sandwich sauce (thousand island dressing) I substituted for Mayo.. I also had the Thai Chicken Salad - it comes with some thai sauce on the chicken already so you don't even really need the thai dressing that also comes with it.. Lettuce is fresh and doesn't taste stale like other packaged salads. the chicken was cold though to my surprise because it was supposed to be "grilled" chicken. . . They also offer soups like clam chowder . . Their set up is really efficient, you order at one end, move along the line past the beer and chips and then you pay at the end. The sandwiches are made assembly line style so there isn't much room for error.. . After you order they give you a little buzzer thing that rings when your sandwich is up. This definitely alleviates any confusion when it's busy and the line up is really long.. . I also tried the little chocolate chip mini muffins that come prepackaged in the cup (emergency breakfast food). They weren't too bad, basically tasted like chocolate chip cookies in the form of mini muffins.. . For anyone staying in Planet Hollywood looking for a quick bite, (especially after a night of drinking and dancing lol) this is the perfect option!
Meh... Tasty and fresh bread, but way too little meat for the amount of bread. Way overrated. 3.5 stars
earl's is great after a night out and great for a sober meal. the sandwiches are pricey (~$7) for the size but yummy!. . can't go wrong with the original. i love the horseradish sauce in it. gives it an interesting flavor.
Can never go wrong coming here to fulfill the drunchies! With an assortment of sandwiches, I always find myself grabbing their Chipotle Chicken Avocado sandwich! . . My friend isn't such a fan of the chipotle sauce and recently asked if she could replace it with ranch instead. They were completely understanding and replaced the sauce with her request. Just in case some people are wondering if they can substitute something! . . It's always a great place to try and I'm sure you will not be disappointed!
Pricey for what you get, but the food is great.
This is a great place for a quick late night Vegas sandwich. The price is absolutely affordable for the place it is in. The sandwich is a 3 stars sandwich but compared to many places at my home state, this is a better choice.. I will definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas.
When it's 4am and you've been drinking and gambling at Planet Hollywood and have worked up QUITE the appetite, Earl of Sandwich is a gift from above!! . . It's open 24/7, which is amazing! And the sandwiches are delish. Tried the veg when I was there and it was yummy and decently priced from what I recall. The bread is AMAZING. I was talking to one of the girls behind the counter and she was telling me that the sandwiches are ridic bad for you - apparently the bread is dipped in olive oil as the sandwiches are made...... sober- sounds like a horrible idea.... drunk- BEST thing ever (although I still felt bad .... kind of). . The people we were with always end up here during their nights in Vegas and we totally understand why. I'll be back.
A good sandwich, but not the best I've tried.  We decided to split the roast beef and jerk chicken to get some variety.  I'm normally a beef guy, but I think the jerk chicken had more flavor.  . . The sandwiches are small and I prefer more meat.  The bread to meat ratio was too far to the bread.  The bread is good, toasted and hot, but I want to be able to taste more meat in a sandwich.
Cheap and cheerful and delicious is so hard to find on the strip.  I highly recommend coming here if you want something easy and tasty.  I'm a huge fun and tend to bring people here when on a budget or if they want to avoid the long process of going to a restaurant.  . . I haven't had a bad sandwhich so you can't go wrong.  They do a great job in pairing the right type of bread with the meat and type of sandwich. Plus, I am happy withthe size and portions when compared to the cost (especially because it's on the strip)
Really good..... . 4 stars not 5. maybe my expectations were too high going in, I had read the reviews and went specifically because of yelp and the excellent reviews.. It was good....really good.... was it great?? Was it the best sandwich ever?? No.. If I am at the Planet Hollywood, I would go again.. Would I make a special trip just to eat at Earl of Sandwich? No. . The breakfast sandwiches look better, but they stop serving them at 11:00AM
I got the Tuna melt. She got the original. . . The tuna melt was great. I don't usually get them because you just never know with tuna. But based on the reviews I did and it was great. . . Price point is great. The sandwiches were both under $7 and large. Great price for Vegas. . . Service was fast.
The line is usually long but i have to admit, their sandwiches are on point. I have tried the cannonballs, Hawaiian bbq and jerk chicken. I thought the cannonballs were okay. Its one dimensional, and you get tired of the overpowering flavor half way. Howw ever i come back here for the Hawaiian and jerk chicken, flavorful and just perfect. I love the toasted bread i think it makes the sandwiches so good. Another downside is that it isn't as filling and you want to buy more but it's just so damn expensive. But its good and worth trying!
Good sandwich, surly lady taking our money...... Actually applied fresh lipstick before serving us. . Can't take anything away from the sandwiches and the rest of the staff though.
My favorite sandwich place!!! Hawaiian BBQ is my favorite!!!! Love this place!
delicious!!!!!
Very good place!  Love their sandwiches; they're always toasted and their "Original" (roast beef and horseradish) is delicious!
Maybe I ordered the wrong sandwich, but this was just ok. Good price. but the sandwich was kind of dry and not very flavorful.. . Bonus star for being open late. It's so hard to find something to eat after leaving nightclubs, so thanks!
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PLACE!!! This is my first choice of food @ Boston Logan Airport. Also have gone to the one inside Miracle Mile shops! Fast service & delicious sandwiches!!
I love this place more than I can even express! Every single sandwich I've ever had from Earl's has been super delicious, and the prices are pretty good. I take all of my friends to the one at Planet Hollywood every chance I get. . I highly recommend Earl of Sandwich!
Hands down the best place to go before or after a night of white boy wasted partying. Been here two times and both times I have enjoyed their sandies. I ordered the Chipotle Turkey ... and I'm confident, almost 98 percent sure they might be putting crack in here. . . . The toasted bread is what really brings out the joy in each bite and I can tell my stomach is getting pumped to take on some more alcohol. Chipotle sauce is delicious and goes without saying. . . . If you're not looking for something super expensive and just a quick bite before stumbling back in your hotel, this is it. You won't regret it.
By far one of the best samiches that I have ever had the privilege of indulging with. . . The first time I had it was in November 2013, day before the Las Vegas Half-Marathon, the Cannonballs! was beyond magnificent that after the half-marathon I celebrated the feat by eating two. . . Fresh, artisan bread, meatballs delicious. Definitely a must have if ever in Vegas. Located in the Shoppes in Planet Hollywood.
Their hours are amazing and food is unbelievable.
There is nothing to say about this place other than these are the BEST sandwhiches in Vegas, hands down!
Good place to grab something quick
I have recently visited this location with a group of friends to enjoy a dinner as we are all visiting the city in celebration of our school break. I have spoken highly of your restaurant to them as I had visited various locations including the one in Las Vegas at least twice. However to my misfortune this time the experience was DREADFUL. Out of 5 people I was the second person to order, my order consisted of a Caprese which after my whole party was done eating was handed to me damn COLD and quite UN_TASTEFUL. To my surprise, upon me approaching one of the employees to complain about the sandwich, he simply disregarded my comment and continued shuffling bags. I had to call to his attention twice before they acknowledge my presence, after they had heard my comment I was told that they did not give me my sandwich earlier because the "buzzers" were not working properly and I was excused. I, unhappy with the experience wanted to continue to voice my un-satisfaction with the service, such for which I was ignored. However the cashier did proceed to ask the employee if anything was wrong. I approached the cashier and tell her that the sandwich was extremely late and was also cold, comment she acknowledges which such disdain, I FELT EMBARRASSED to have mentioned it in front of the other customers. This was an absolutely terrible and embarrassing experience, I do not come to an establishment to be brushed-off or neglected as just another "assumed" drunk customer, much the less be PATRONIZED and ignored when trying to voice a complaint about the food or services provided. This was an incredibly terrible experience which left me a quite sour taste for this company which I had really enjoyed in the past.
Sandwiches hot or cold, you'll definitely love this place. Only thing is the wait so be prepared to wait a while here. Most I've waited was about 30 mins. Reason why there's a wait because this place is that good if you enjoy a quick eat instead of going to the Spice Market Buffet which is also good. Even with the long wait, you won't have that of a hard time to find a table because place is on the go; they order, eat and leave so by the time your order is ready, a table should be ready for you as well. Or the other option is to have another person reserve the seat while you order or vice versa. I haven't had much time waiting for my order after I've ordered and paid but I've seen other customers wait a while for their order either because of the confusion from the employees or just way too many people here. Plenty of employees working here so not sure why some people have to wait so long for their order to show up. You'll notice also that sometimes they take orders in waves. First batch orders and then they'll wait a while before they take the next person's order in a way to not make the place too crowded. . . I've tried most of their sandwiches here. Highlights for me are their Holiday Turkey, Full Montagu, Chipotle Chicken Avocado and their Hawaiian BBQ. I also recommend getting their Tomato Soup - one of the best I've had. Not too salty and they fill it up with small pieces of bread. You won't be disappointed with their sandwiches here.
Came for a late lunch and ordered the chipotle chicken avocado sandwich, it was just the right size and yummy.  Better alternative to eating pizza or McDonald's while on the strip.  My bf got the Earl's Club Sandwich while my friend got the Holiday Turkey.  Both sandwiches looked yummy.  . . Come to this place to keep the hungry monster away.
Been here twice in last few days. Tuna melt was good, wish there was more of a celery crunch. Like everyone says nothing better than golden brown French bread. Tomato soup was great for dipping. The Original was plain, no kick in horseradish sauce. But the roast beef was surprisingly super tender and moist. Day 2 recommend salad over soup, great Baja chicken salad. They don't go cheap on toppings! More chicken and avocado and extras than romaine. Soup was too tiny day before. And the Avocado BLT is my favorite now. Cooked a little crispier like a blt should. Bacon thin but tasty and cooked perfect. Great Sammie. They do not have the Caribbean Jerk sandwich anymore :(
Not understanding the rave reviews, but it is nice that they're open 24 hours. The sandwiches run about $7, and they're the size of your average Subway 6 incher with slightly more filling. Relative to other Strip food, this is still a bargain. Quality/taste reminded me of Quizno's - good but not 5 stars.
I do not know how this place is one of the highest rated places in LV. The sandwich is small and can no way be fresh like they claim it is. Do not waste your time in their 20-30 minute line. Marginal at best.
Thank you, EoS for being a gem of delicious and cheap food among a sea of either crappy fast food or expensive restaurants I can't afford. :). . I ordered the full montagu (hold the cheddar!) and it was delicious. The roast beef was thick and juicy, the sandwich sauce was savory, and the bread was toasted to a chewy perfection. Paired with some chips (and a beer if you really want), and you're ready to take on all that Vegas has to offer. I'll be back to try another one of those amazing sammiches!
One of the best sandwiches you will ever have. Also good price for Vegas. The only negative is the long lines but I guess thats what happens when you offer a superior product. TheFull Montagu was great and the cup of baked potato soup was also on point. Would come here again!
Came here because of all the hype and it was definitely worth it! :). . My girls and I came here pretty early (around 930AM-ish) and there was no wait. I ordered the Earl's Club Sandwich and was immediately given a beeper thingy. . . The wait itself took about 15 minutes. The sandwich itself was so good. It was super crunchy and had lots of flavor. I tried the other sandwiches that my friends got and it was pretty good as well.. . Will be back to try out the other sandwiches from here. Just make sure to come at an earlier time to avoid the lines and the wait to make your sandwiches! :)
Great place for a sandwich, the wraps are great too. You must try one if you're in Vegas.
The place is way over-hyped.  Wait is rediculous, there are far better options than waiting 45-1 hour for a mediocre sandwich.  I can see why people like it, but certainly not worth the wait.  Save yourself the time and disappointment and go elsewhere.
Earl's!!!! I hadn't eaten here in years. Well I just went two days ago and I am happy to say it is still the same :). My two girlfriends did not want to go (they are way more posh then me) so I went by myself. Sadly the line was about 50+ in front of me. Could you believe I still waited? First let me say, this is one of the cheapest places on The Strip. Their sandwiches are still priced at $6.50 a pop. I always order the Holiday Turkey which comes with cranberry sauce. OMG. My mouth is watering right now as I write this... oh I also had the oatmeal raisin cookie to top it off (only $2) and that was phenomenal as well. If you have never experienced Earl's, it is a must when you attend Vegas. If you are reading this and debating it, just get off your phone and head over right now ;)
Earl of Sandwich is a South Vegas Strip gem. . . Too often I find myself wanting to indulge in great food while in Vegas. I never want to settle for just fast food to pass over my hunger. EoS is the perfect compromise between price, convenience, and quality. . . Their sandwiches are so damn good. My favorite is the Hawaiian BBQ. The fresh toasted bread might be the best part, but everything is quality. Get full and enjoy it for under ten dollars? Way better than stooping at panda or sabaro. . . If you're looking at EoS as an option for eating right now, I strongly encourage you to go. You probably will not need to take my work though. See all these reviews and ratings? Its good! Its cheap! I promise, you'll enjoy it.
