Disappointed again!!! Crap service, small order size, single layer of hash, tasteless biscuits , watered down tomato soup, not a smile in the house, and really I have to wait 10 minutes to get a water refill ...really sad with so many good things happening downtown!!! $50 for this , I'm done!!!
We've been here a bunch. I'm a fan. I really love the coffee. I stepped out of my "normal" and got the shrimp and grits on my last visit. It was really good. I was a bit worried...but I'm going to have to add this to my rotation from now on. You got to try this place...and afterward....step on over to the container park and check that place out.
Wonderful breakfast and great friendly service. Everything was fresh, and the coffee is roasted locally.
Wonderful meal with my wife .. We were staying on the strip but came downtown and as we didn't want to eat at a chain or the heart attack restaurant we lucked out finding this ... . . I had the grilled cheese and soup which was excellent and by wife had the BLT which she loved ... Nice staff and a friendly atmosphere ... Good value for money ... If it was in New York it would have a line out the door ... If you find yourself downtown in Vegas next to the container village definitely try here
Great brunch experience today at Eat. My pal had the chicken fried steak and I had the shrimp and grits. Service was great and even though we were told 45 min wait time, we were in quicker! Can't wait to return.
I heard and read about this place here from yelp and others I know. So finally I went to give it a shot only to realize ehhhh it was not really worth the long wait (45 minutes for party of 4)  and the drive for me. I ordered the egg Benedict one of my only favorite breakfast items. I just did not care for it!! Something about it and the textures of the whole thing did not go together. I ordered it standard with no tweaking or changing and to me it just did not do it, the other dish I had tried was the coned beef with potatoes and eggs that was alright. Probably better in my opinion than the egg Benedict if you had to choose.   Over all I do not think I would do it again.
I've been coming here since the doors have opened... Phenomenal food, always consistent and quaint atmosphere. Great edition to downtown!. . Highly recommend the posole soup and The Reuben.
Reading is purely on services. . . Visiting Vegas to see my family. They all said we need to go to EAT because of the food. Wish we would have had a chance to try the food. This is how things played out . . 11:30 am Called to make a reservation for a group of 10 at 1:00 pm. I was told that they don't take reservations but since I called in with enough notice they would work it out for us to be seated. . . 12:20 pm I arrived early with my husband to the restaurant to put our names on the waiting list. My husband was told "we will see what we can do", in regards to seating our group. . . 12:30 pm I confirmed with the hostess that we would be seated and the owner came by at the same time and said we would be seated at 1:00 pm. (Happy to hear this). . 12:50 pm My enter party arrives and three tables are open two right next to each other and one in a separate corner. And the rest of my group arrives. . 1:00 pm Other people are seated that came in after us.. . 1:10 pm No updated from the Hostess about us being seated and more people are being seated that arrived after us. . . 1:15 pm My brother call "La Comida" just one block up and one block over from "EAT" to see if they can seat us. They said "Yes!". I told the hostess we were leaving and we all walked over to "La Comida". . Very disappointed on the Customer Services and lack of communication. Granted the location is small but if I was told when I originally called they couldn't seat such a large group we would have never wasted our time waiting.
Im missing the pancakes already.  This place has the best pancakes and cinnamon biscuits ever.  We took the deuce from the strip to downtown and it was easy to find.  I wish I would have ate breakfast here everyday during my visit.
Cute spot. Good food.. . The only thing I wanted from Eat was not available--the beignets!! Ugh. My heart was crushed to learn they didn't have any :( Alas, I opted for a chicken sandwich and it was good; nothing too special. The service was okay and given how small the menu is, I expect the staff to know the ingredients of the menu items which wasn't the case.. . Would I return? Only If I happened to be in the area but wouldn't be my first choice.
Nicely done brunch. Interesting food and reasonably priced. Friendly service staff...
Discovered this place behind the container park after we spoke to several local las vegans, is this a word??? Anyway, we are so impressed with the FOOD, the servers are fun, happy, and efficient.  But it is the food that keeps us driving from CA.  We discovered this place a month ago and there hasn't been anything on the menu that has not wowed us.  Great food spot.  Can't wait for our next visit. Wish we had one closer to home.
I was so exited to try this place out! I thought finally something new downtown! After three visits, this placegets boring. Yes they do have some few good entree to offer, but are they memorable? I would say no. What memorable to me is the wait I get all the time for meeting a friend for brunch. Their policy is they wont seat you until the whole party is present. Yes maybe a friend or two is running late, but to see the place empty full of open chairs, and still they won't seat you, now that's different service.. . There's also this discomfort of eating when the owner just seats there and watch her servers do their job. She'll correct them discreetly but not so privately. I've seen owners help out by greeting you or seating you, but this one is different. She just seats in her throne. I am more about interaction with your customers, but never in the three visits have I seen her interact with customers. . . Like I said, food is good, but not memorable.
4.5 stars! Love everything about this place for the most part. It has been on my bookmark list for awhile and finally got to try Eat last month. Myself and 2 other friends came after the Color Run. I was really worried the wait would be super long from the other color runners, we were told it would be half an hour, but it only ended up being 15 minutes. I already knew I wanted the chicken fried steak since it had good reviews and looked delicious from the pictures on here. I also ordered passion tea, which was okay I wish I would of ordered the strawberry drink instead. I was very pleased with the chicken fried steak, the breading was well seasoned and it was a huge piece, a sharable portion. The gravy and seasoned potatoes went with it pretty well too. I ordered the house made chips instead of eggs and I was really disappointed because they look good in the pictures but didn't have the texture I was hoping for. I also had the English muffin as my side, which was nothing spectacular. My 2 other friends both ordered the chilaquiles scrambled eggs, they were both kinda whatever about it because they didn't expect it to be vegetarian. I did I have a bite and liked it, but I always welcome vegetarian options in my diet.  The inside is awesome, hipster type of fare I must say. I cannot wait to come back, I just don't know what I'll order because everything else looks so delicious.
This place is phenomenal. Great service great atmosphere and amazing food. I had the corned beef hash and pancakes and they were the best corned beef hash and best pancakes I've had at least in the last few years. Oh, and there's a tesla supercharger a block away so that's nice too.
The food was pretty good, the bacon delicious. The orange juice was freshly squeezed, too bad this year's oranges weren't any good. Great coffee, toast is 1/2" thick. . The service was friendly and prompt. . The pancakes were HUGE, well done and tasted like funnel cake (I love funnel cake).. A bit salty on the potatoes and I like my bacon a bit more crispy. . Next time I will ask to be seated on the orange chairs. The wooden ones with green fabric have NO padding or support. You have to crawl out of them.
Best shrimp and grits I've had on the west coast by far! Super excited about this place.
This is the breakfast place downtown.  Great pancakes and egg dishes.  Lunch rocks w/a gr8 veggie burger and other American regional dishes.  Prepare to wait at peak hours and go hungry.  Near Container Park.
Went here this weekend. Had the chicken fried steak and strawberry lemonade and shirt stack of pancakes. Everything was great. Free parking on Sundays.
The bf and I went in for our 'Valentine's Brunch' (the weekend following Valentine's Day) We waited no more than 3 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was filled with patrons but not in an overwhelming sense. We were seated at kind of an awkward table. It was a tiny table RIGHT next to a bar-like seating area. We sort of felt weird sitting in regular height chairs right next to people sitting on bar height chairs, but whatever. Definitely not enough to keep us away. I ordered a hot green tea (which was organic and didn't turn the water a lime green color, I hate that!) and the shrimp and grits. Boyfriend ordered their country fried steak and eggs with a side of pancakes to share.. . Shrimp & Grits: SOoosososososoo delicious. I love the smooth texture of their grits  and the hints of crispiness from the bacon and pico de gallo. The shrimps (which they gave an abundant amount of) were cooked perfectly and the over-easy eggs they topped the whole thing off with gave the whole dish an extra creaminess that nobody can get mad over. They give you really big portion so I didn't end up eating the whole thing. Boyfriend didn't mind finishing it off at all :). . Country Fried Steak and Eggs (with seasoned potatoes): I had a bite of the steak and it was delicious. Not to much breading and the meat was tender. The gravy was perfect. Thick but not pudding-like. (gross). . Pancakes: The pancakes were sooooo fluffy and delicious. They had a yummy crispiness all around the edge and had a beignet-like texture and flavor to them. They soaked up the syrup like nobody's business so I suggest you do the 'pour and eat right away' method. . . The service was OK. Our waiter checked on us to fill up our drinks (once) but then forgot that I wanted more hot water for my tea. It's conveniently located right beside the container park so I could see us having breakfast/brunch here again.
Really good place to eat. No pun intended lol. .  When I got off work I was really hungry. So. I decided to go eat at eat. The service was amazing but I will have to get my own silverware. Not meaning to sound like a prude. Plus the end of my toast was too hard.. . On the bright side it wasn't that much for all that I got. Side of eggs. Side of bacon. Side of toast. Plus an entree salad. (Of which I forgot the name but it was their special.) Goat cheese, almonds, greens, strawberries, buleberries, and their housemade special vinaigrette which I also forgot the name. Oh, plus water and an Arnold Palmer.. . I also wanted to add, every server came up and asked if I was okay at least once. *thumbs up* That's good service.. . I'm pretty sure it was a simple error to have forgotten the silverware. I mean, I did get there 30 min before closing. . . All in all, delicious. :) second time here and I'm digging it. Definitely will be coming a third time.
Cute little place across the street from The Downtown Container Park in Downtown LV. I feel like it's soul-food in a hip atmosphere. . . The food was good, but I'm convinced I didn't probably order the best thing on the menu. I went the route of a veggie burger (which I was told they don't make themselves, but they are shipped in, deconstructed, and then more ingredients are added. Probably not my favorite selling point!) but it was delicious and I topped it off with a cup of chicken posole soup. . . I did get a little food envy over the grilled cheese at times!!!! HUGE Texas toast with a nice gooey cheesy filling? Yes, please!
Incredible food, only 5 min walk from the Golden Nugget. Healthy fresh or fresh decadent. One of the best breakfasts we've ever had anywhere. This place is an unexpected downtown treat. We went as a family but is excellent for anyone. Stay away from nasty overpriced buffets downtown. Take a little walk to this amazing restaurant.
Truffle egg sandwich kills me every time. I haven't eaten anything there that I didn't really enjoy. Appetizers, breakfast, lunch, and even the juice.
I had never heard of it until today. Walked in and was taken aback. I ate a roast beef sandwich... It was excellent! My friend had another type sandwich and she devoured it. What a place. A little noisy but the quality of food makes up. Right across the street from container city. It is a place to come back many more times.
I like Eat. I like the fact that it's modern, hip, urban, and located downtown. Charm, character, and frankly, they need more places like these downtown. Just across the street from Container Park and down the street from LVA (geez, where were all these places when I was a student?!). . . PARKING: There's metered parking galore for around $2 an hour during the daytime around here and DO NOT think you can get away without being fined. . . PROTIP: Get a player's card at El Cortez (free; takes two minutes) and you get to park for FREE at either of the manned parking garages (located at 7th and Ogden). Even when they charge $10 parking on Fridays/Saturday nights now, it's free if you flash your card. If you suck at parallel parking like I do even for the after-6pm free street parking, then park in the garages (you don't have to worry about walking too far to get to Container Park or the Fremont East bars). . . AMBIANCE: Eat. is a cute breakfast/lunch place. They're only open 8AM-3PM on weekdays and close an hour earlier on weekends. I like the decor and there's a ton of seating here for 2-4 people tables. Great use of space without feeling too cramped. There's a nice breakfast bar area near the cashier but I feel like it's a secret "oh-god-please-don't-pick-to-sit-here-because-you'll-just-stare-at-us"-type thing. Luckily there's another high table bar in the center that you can sit at. . . Hip, casual atmosphere. Fun place to meet with friends or a semi-loud business lunch.. . FOOD: I ordered thechicken sausage, and the Chicken Pot Pie (they offer it every monday) Every other day than monday, they offer a special off-menu item so be sure to ask! . . I thought it was kind of funny listing "free-range chicken" at every mention in the menu. I wanted to ask my server for a profile of my slaughtered hen right there. You know, just to make sure it was a happy free-range chicken when it was living. . . Chicken pot pie ($14ish?) was good. Nicely seasoned with the right amount of mashed potatoes, gravy (dear god the gravy), carrots, slices of moist chicken, and peas inside. The pastry encasing it was fluffy, golden, and wasn't too hard biting into it. Comes with a small side salad of mixed greens and sliced carrots. Presentation was nice! Does it blow me away for what it is flavor-wise? Nope. Delicious, yes. Very well-thought out, but not wowing. Portion was decent, but not really worth the price tag. . . My chicken sausage ($5ish) side dish was okay. A bit tough, but the flavor was decent. Honey-soaked flavor. Tasted fine but not really worth the price for portion honestly. . . Service was good. Checked back on us often and our server recommended the pot pie to me. . . VERDICT: Overall, Eat is a few unique steps up from your average brunch place. Presentation of the food is gorgeous and the flavors are good/okay, but the price tag? Ouch. Maybe it's quality of the ingredients that justifies it. The food isn't mediocre by any means, but it's not something stunning as I'm led to believe. It's a great place to reenact scenes from Portlandia. I would definitely come back for lunch with the girlfriends. I like Eat a lot, but I'm not drinking the kool-aid just yet.
The pancakes and Benedict are spectacular! Very cool interior with a great atmosphere and communal table. A phenomenal addition to the Vegas breakfast scene.
This hipster joint in downtown Vegas is a must-visit while in the city of sin!  The witty-ness of the decor and the art and culture this place has are all just extras though..... . Scrambled eggs, feta cheese and sauteed mushrooms between two fat pieces of lightly buttered sourdough bread: the Truffled Egg Sandwich. That is really all that needs to be said about Eat because this meal is so amazing!  (It is also so kick-ass that they serve it all day... yum!). . Other highlights of the meal included the coffee- a delightful bold blend with almond milk and raw sugar available! . . Justin really wanted to try the chicken fried steak (which they stop serving exactly at 11am) so we ended up here for brunch on day 2 also! . . This time I had a delightful cup of chamomile tea and the cinnamon apple oatmeal with strawberries. Both were great choices for a lighter breakfast! . . The service was excellent and the food was consistent- I would definitely recommend this spot for an awesome brunch downtown!
Its a quaint restaurant right across the street from Container park. We went on a Saturday afternoon. Waited 30 mins for a table. I ordered the country fried steak. It was pretty good. Didnt think that the gravy was too heavy. The fried steak stayed crisp. Good flavors. The potatoes though...yum! The skin of the potatoes were nicely seasoned and crispy. I would come back again.
This place is wonderful! The food is fantastic. The staff is very friendly. You can't really ask for much more. I had the blt and it was probably the best sandwich I've had in a LONG time. It's not a huge restaurant and I think that definitely adds to the charm. I'll be back for sure!
Great service and great food.  Especially loved the potatoes that came with my eggs Benedict and the waffles were fluffy and tasty.  Finding a parking space is a bit of a challenge:)
Eat.  Ate.  . . The two words you'll see on the door walking in hangry, and walking out full.  Very clever if you ask me.. . I ordered their chicken fried steak.  This plate was huge.  The CFS was smothered in gravy sauce, came with two eggs (any way you want it), potatoes and butter toasted bread.  The customer service here was really great.  Everyone was friendly, and walked around with a smile.  Very very local spot located down the street from the Fremont Experience.  . . TIP - they're very strict about not serving the chicken fried steak after 11am.  If you try ordering it at 11:01am, you're shit out of luck.  Trust me, I know.  Was definitely worth coming back the next day.
This is a great addition to downtown Las Vegas that I really, really liked.  Across the street on the back side of Container Park it is ideal located.. . The interior decor was great . . . from the paintings, to the wall art, to the hanging guitars . . . it was a pleasant change from normal.. . I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and poached eggs . . . which were amazing . . . the beef, potatoes, and peppers were cooked perfectly . . . and the contract off the poached eggs, made this dish a true delight.. . The service was a little slower than I would have like . . . and that was the reason for the deduction on one star . . . but this place could very easily be a five star.
The food at EAT is super fresh and delicious!! Very cool little spot in the heart of the hip area of freemont east. The only negative comment I would have is that they aren't open later.. Having a dinner service would be awesome!! I've wanted to try the chilaquiles but they stop serving them at 11am I believe. I have been to EAT about 3 times and each experience was great food was amazing and very friendly and helpful staff.
Food was fantastic! I got the daily special which was Prime Rib hash which came with a green chile sauce and two poached eggs, and giant toast. It was all fantastic! I highly recommend this place.
This place is great, its just what vegas needs in the new downtown. . Food, service, experience were all fantastic!
If you're driving by looking for this place, you can totally miss it. It's a very small, cute place located downtown on 7th & Carson St. I got to known of this place through a friend. . . Usually the wait for this place is pretty long & people are hanging out outside waiting to be called in. Fortunately, today the odds were on our favor! No wait to be seated! . . We first had ordered strawberry cinnamon biscuits which were to die for! They were biscuits swimming in this strawberry jam sauce. It wasn't too sweet but decently sweet enough. . . I had ordered the Shrimp & Grits! Which is, hands down, the BEST, grits I ever had. Usually restaurants over cook or under cook grits but this place makes it to perfection. It had picco di gallo on top which added a Little kick in your mouth. The bacon on the bottom just added the necessary flavors to this dish. I finished the whole thing! & could've licked the bowl but controlled myself.. . Only thing I really had an issue with was the wait to get our food. Due to the table next to us of 3 men that practically ordered the whole menu, we had to wait a long time for our food. The men were extremely entertaining because one guy would net pick the dishes to the waitress-- "this needed more salt" or "would have tasted better seared" LOL! But anyways, it was defiantly worth that wait!
I'm almost glad that I don't live in Las Vegas because I would "Eat" here every single weekend!! LV certainly has it's fair share of memorable restaurants in the hotels and on the strip, but Eat. is one of the best breakfast/brunch spots I've ever laid my palate on...period! . . Thanks Chef Natalie for the awesome recommendations.The roast beef sandwich was simple yet complex...full of flavor and texture. My friend loves shrimp & grits more than life itself, and she raved about it the rest of the afternoon! . . Next time I'm going to try those amazing pancakes that I hear so many good things about. . . Enjoy!
This was the best thing about Las Vegas. Had a business trip and I am not a fan of Vegas. Downtown is becoming really cool and this place is really cool. I had chicken fried steak two eggs any style, country pork gravy, chive. potatoes & toast and my husband had huevos motulenos two eggs over-easy w/red&green new mexican chili, black beans, peas feta, sauteed bananas on corn tortilla. Afterward you can walk 2 blocks to container Las Vegas or The Mob Museum. Some will think the area is dicey, however, I felt very safe. Check out this restaurant and Downtown Vegas. No I'm not paid, but I just like the vibe of this area and especially this restaurant which is why I came down there in the first place.They have a sign in East that I want to use in my gentrifying n'hood "Be Nice or Leave"
Great value, awesome food. Only downside....no mimosas......what Vegas? Haha! But I would totally return!
The Truffled egg sandwich and cinnamon biscuits were a great breakfast.  Downtown is not my favorite place to visit when in Vegas but Eat was worth the trip from the strip to get away from the casinos and buffets.  I went on a Monday at 10:30 and it was pretty busy (but not so much that I had to wait) so I expect that weekends are packed.  The staff was friendly and service was prompt.  I'll definitely come back.
