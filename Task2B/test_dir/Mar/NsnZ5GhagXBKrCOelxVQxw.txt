The food was very impressive.  The experience was what ruined the entire evening.  The noise level was quite loud, but nothing that I haven't experienced before.  We made a reservation and were really looking forward to some great sushi.  We ordered edamame to start with, the Samba Sushi Chef's Selection and a dragon roll.  The waitress recommended we get more, even though we had already run through the menu with her and settled on what we would be ordering.  The edamame arrived, and seriously 30 seconds later all the sushi made its way to the table.  We maybe spent 30 total minutes at the restaurant.  It was a overall a really unfortunate experience, and had it not been for the food, it would have been truly awful.
I had only been here for early dinner and lunch, but for my bachelorette weekend we decided to have dinner there on Friday night. WOW! The service was incredible and the sushi was delicious. . . They have an incredible seaweed salad. The sashimi is prefect, you can't go wrong with any option. They even bought the cutest complimentary drinks for us. Thank you Sushi Samba for making the dinner great!!! . . They ambiance is the perfect spot if you want a nice fun dinner but still want to be able to hear your conversation. . . I highly recommend it.
Creative dishes but too expensive. Portions were really small. We spent $45 and were still hungry.
Open late! The sushi here was awesome! The service was ok... I wanted to give this place a 5 star but the waitress insisted on letting us know about the drama in the restaurant repeatedly. We had a crab roll that was to die for.. fresh crab in the roll along with a king crab claw with the fresh claw meat still in it. We ordered a roll that was to have no rice and as a substitute for the seaweed they use cucumber that is sliced thin to wrap around the sashimi inside. Unfortunately after waiting for about 20 min for this roll the waitress came to tell us they made a mistake in the back and no longer have the cucumber. In order to make up for it they gave us a roll they made in error on the house. All in all I would come back, but might avoid the waitress as I feel she aired to much of the internal problems to us.
...just finished. Wow. Service was great, good was amazing ...I could go for another round. The roll with the Kobe beef on top. Get that one.
Must must take my bf here the next time I go. So yummy!! . . The restaurant was very casual with spectacular food and fantastic wait-staff. Our waiter suggested he choose a tasting menu according to our party size (keeping in mind the 1 girl who couldn't eat raw fish) and our budget ($50 per girl). Smartest thing we did entire trip!! Upon hearing we were there for a bachelorette party, a free round of shots!. . The standouts were the green bean tempura with truffle aioli, wagyu beef gyoza and sea bass skewers. But the yellowtail seviche tacos with chili foam sauce stole the whole damn show. YUM. . . Not so yummy turned out to be the rolls, but we just packed it up and brought it for the girls in the hotel room that were recuperating from the night before. They thought it was delicious. I think we were just full by then.
I have been here probably at least 4x over the past year. I have never had a bad experience yet.  Last night my Aunt was in town visiting.  She was staying on the strip at Treasure Island so we decided to grab some sushi at the Palazzo. . . The Otsunami appetizer of edamame, crispy green beans and green peppers is really good! It was the first time I had sea bass skewers based on other yelp reviews and they did not disappoint! For sushi we had Bobo Brazil roll with is kobe beef, the sushi samba roll with the lobster claw and the Lima roll with Spicy King Crab mix. Also if you want a good cocktail the Samba juice is really good!. . They have a busy bar area to have some drinks, a nice sushi bar and a very lively atmosphere inside the restaurant. . . The only downside if i had to give one isthe rolls are relatively small for the price. However the quality is high! I would recommend checking it out if you are in the area.
OMG this sushi place is over-the-top fresh & fabulous!. Everything was high-end presentation from the leather menus, appetizers, drinks, dishes, decor, staff, music and lighting.  . Experience was WOW...simply WOW.. 2 thumbs up and kisses to the chef and staff for making this such an enjoyable experience!
This place was fantastic. Some of the freshest fish I've ever had, which was disappointing, given that I live near San Francisco.. . The Sweet Plantains were to die for. The Purple Mashed Potatoes were gorgeously displayed and tasty to boot.. . My husband has Celiac disease, and didn't get sick here, and we went twice, because it was so good. We were even able to have dessert there, which is really rare, because most desserts are gluten free. . . The one downside is that the prices are quite steep. However, with the frequency that hubby is able to have sushi, since most sushi rice has wheat in it to make it stick better, it was worth the 100$ check for two people.. . Our waiter was fantastic, and while busy gave outstanding service. He catered to both my and my husbands allergies with an outstanding attitude. Can't wait to come back to Vegas, just to go to this restaurant again.
Food is good. Prices are NOT.. . - Seabass: $29 miso glazed and pretty freakin delicious. Cooked perfectly also. But the portion was probably 3 maybe 4 bites at most.. . - Handrolls: We had salmon skin, salmon and avocado, spicy tuna, and yellowtail. The ingredients were fresh, but the rolls were very small and about ~$8-$10/each.. . - Various rolls: We tried the Yamato ($19 for 3 pieces). There wasn't even enough for me to get a chance to try it since there were only 3 pieces LOL, but my friends said it was probably the best roll there. Pure decadence being topped with foie gras, caviar, and gold flakes. We also tried a few other rolls for which I can't remember the names (SORRY!) but they had wagyu beef and another had maine lobster. Both were interesting, but I wasn't blown away.. . - Nigiri: Fresh but again, extremely pricey! $5-$10 a PIECE! Yup, not an order of 2 pieces...that price is PER PIECE! O_o. . - Sides: We ordered the corn and plantains at $7 each. The corn was delicious but a very small portion in a cup. Same thing with plantains. Grilled deliciously but only a few slices for a whopping $7.. . If you haven't gotten the undertone of my review yet, it's that this place is EXPENSIVE! LOL We each paid roughly $50/person and no one left feeling full. It wouldn't have been so bad had the service been better though. We were missing a few things at the table and had to ask several times for it (place setting, water, and soy sauce dishes).
THE SERVICE WAS THE WORST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED---- EVER! . . We were sitting for about 15-20 minutes before receiving food or cocktail menus, and this was not because the waitress had not gotten around to us (she was there the minute we sat down) but rather because "she lost the menus" or "couldn't find any in this area". She proceeded to describe menu items to us insteadof just going to find menus. I ordered a drink based off her description and ended up sending it back because it was a completely different type of liquor than she had said it was. . . We only received menus when we insisted on getting them. When she did bring the menus she proceeded to tell us how she had to go all the way to the front of the restaurant to get them... Are we supposed to feel bad for you? That is part of your job! The food was great, the service awful making for a unenjoyable experience and one that will not bring me back to any of their locations.
My first yelp review!. I ate here on Monday night with my husband and we had an amazing evening. The food was spectacular. Our waiter put together a tasting menu for us that was out of this world. Highly recommend the sea bass skewers, and yellow tail tacos. Our waiter Jeff was great, everything he suggested was wonderful and we were also equally impressed with a young manager named Jason. He was so attentive and we felt he genuinely cared about us and our experience. My only complaint would be that the music was too loud and took away from the ambience. Other than that it was a great experience and we will be coming back for sure. I just wish there was a SushiSamba here in San Diego!
one of the best restaurant in las vegas. not as good as the sushi places in san francisco . but its really fresh
I had a group of 9.  The service was the absolute BEST compared to other places we dined.  The food was amazing and the Manager and our server Carmine took great care of us.  The majority of the table went with the chef's selection.  We all did $50 a head and the food came out.  It was an incredible experience and my palette thanks you.  The decor is hip and the music was to our liking  The sea-bass skewers?  OMG.  Everything was superb.  Only thing was when it was time to wrap up and close the bill.  Took a little longer than expected but still a great experience and we enjoyed our time there.
Absolutely amazing food & even better service, thank you Vanessa for all of your excellent service, A++++!
Sushi Samba was amazing! The food was delicious and service was perfect! We ordered so many things I don't even think I can remember.. . Yellowtail taquitos - not really taquitos, more like tacos, but still yummy!. . Tempura Green Beans - the dipping sauce was great!. . Salt and Pepper Squid - always love squid! They're big pieces so it's hard to eat in one bite, but also really chewy so hard to take bites.. . Miso seabass skewers w/ Peruvian corn - my favorite dish! The fish was so flavorful and cooked perfectly! The corn was ok, but everyone else loved it!. . Lima roll, bobo Brazil, San Paulo - all great rolls, we wanted to order more of them but. got too full. . . Ramen - was just okay. Wouldn't order it again.. . Cucumber Soju - so good and refreshing! . . Chocolate dipped green tea ice cream - nice and light. Sprinkles with pop rocks to give it some fun texture!. . Overall food was amazing and I definitely had some of the best sushi that night! The manager came around to all the tables and he was super generous with us! He recommended a bunch of great dishes and cocktails and made our night way more fun! Be careful though because it's pretty pricey, but well worth it when you're willing to splurge!
My favorite restaurant in Vegas. I go here whenever I'm in town. I always leave it up to the server/ chef when I order so I've tried a little bit of everything and have never been disappointed. On my most recent visit I really enjoyed the skewers & the scallops. You really can't go wrong here.
I really enjoyed dining here with my group of girlfriends. One thing I loved is their family style menu where we can share bunch of things off their menu. Also the variety of seafood, sushi and meat. The price is very reasonable as well. We pretty much tried half the menu and it was all delicious! Everything looked and tasted perfectly. Also, the environment is really fun and comfy that my friends and I had an amazing time. Definitely recommend this place large groups.
We walked in and were seated quickly. That was nice.. . Food was good. Pricey, but good. The edamame and fried tempura were absolutely amazing for a small appetizer before our sushi.. . The sushi menu doesn't really have too much of a variety.. . And the music was just so loud that I couldn't enjoy my company's conversation.
This was by far our best meal in Vegas! Isabella was an amazing server!  . . She suggested the taste menu and it did not disappoint!  They catered to my gluten free needs and the food was amazing. . Overall amazing food and service!  Can't wait to come back!
I learned that you can become quite full from sushi. Very full.. Everything was delectable and unique.. . The only downside to the experience was that - we all told our waiter what our overall budget was for the meal and to work within those parameters. It seems it was our fault for trusting him when he said he's done this many times before.. . Our tabs came out $30 higher per person than what we allotted. Major bummer on our wallets but I never heard our stomachs complain.. . You could dine here on a budget and be happy as can be. Or you could rack up a big bill. Your call. Either way you'll have left trying some new flavor profiles and enjoyed some delicious food.
My boyfriend took me and another couple here for this past valentines day. . . It was super empty at 8:30 pm on valentines night which I thought was really weird. . . I'll start off by saying service was impeccable. Even the manager came over to check on us and wish us a happy valentines day and even chatted it up with us for a little while. He even brought some kind of champagne with strawberries for us at the end of our dinner. I believe his name was Jeremy so if I'm correct....then thanks Jeremy you definitely made our experience a good one. Kudos to Philip our waiter as well. He dealt with our drunk asses throughout the entire dinner and provided amazing service at the same time. . . We ordered an order of the wagyu gyoza to try. Yeh we ended up ordering another 4 orders right away. I think that might give you a good idea of just how amazing this dish is. I can guarantee you won't be disappointed with it. Then we got the churrasco with like 3 or 4 different meats that came with 3 different sauces. If you've got money to spend then I definitely suggest getting this dish. The spicy tuna hand roll with spicy mayo on top was also AMAZING. Hands down the best spicy tuna hand roll I've ever had. . . The two downsides to this place and the reason I took off one star is because of how pricy this place is for the amount of food they give you and the fact that their bathroom had absolutely no lights. I literally couldn't see where I was or what I was doing the entire time I was in the stall. . . Overall if I have a lot or extra cash to spend then I will most definitely be back for the great service and especially another helping of the wagyu gyoza and spicy tuna hand roll.
