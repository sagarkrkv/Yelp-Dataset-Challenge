Had a nice lunch on a rainy AZ Saturday.  The beer flight and food was very good.  Enough variety on the menu for both the food and the beer.  The atmosphere is just what you want for a brew pub.  Will definitely come back.
So it's beenawhile since my last visit here.  The parking is Always a nightmare and there is always a wait.  The food and the patio were still worth the effort to come here.  Yesterday we ordered the chimi special and I was really let down.  It just seems now that they are always solidly busy,  they have stopped focusing on providing exceptional food. Bummer four peaks, you used to be my go-to, but things are different now.
Line out the door.  45 minute wait on a Wednesday night.  Cramped noisy tables all with the dreaded Barstool.  . . Seems like a good scene if I hadn't been hiking all day.  You obviously don't go there to relax!. . The beer was OK.  Their Peachy Lambic was pretty good. The food is OK.  The service was friendly.. . Four Peaks wins Pheonix's shortest dress award - that might be a huge draw for some!
Just don't get it. It is croweded, the staff is rude, and the food is not that good. . . Maybe it is because I am over the good ole college days, but just is not my cup of tea. . . The food was ok. The drinks were simple. The waitress was rude and not attentive. It was loud and packed to the brim. No way to squeeze into the bar without someone yelling at you because they think you are taking their spot. . . Parking is just dumb. Seriously, rent all the empty lots around you and allow you customers some normal parking. . . Only go because friends ask.
Awesome place to take out-of-town guests. A great variety of brews and a RIDICULOUS Salmon BLT! All of their locations get crowded, so they must be doing something right!
I enjoy the beer selection they offer at four peaks.The service is pretty good, I do like sitting on the patio most times.The food is okay but whenever I eat their chicken strips and fries I can feel my arteries clogging up so be sure to avoid them if you're sensitive like myself.The parking can be a hassle for most people but I don't mind the walk. Alot of beautiful women work there so that's always a plus.
We finally visited the Sunday brunch! Was presently surprised with the service and the drinks! Would highly recommend it and might just go right back!
5 stars all the way!!! I love this bar!! The beers are amazing, every single one of them! The food is on point as well!!! Highly recommend Four Peaks! It is Also a great place to go with a big group of people!! Cool atmosphere! thumbs up!
park half a mile away to visit a crowded frat party that serves ok food and so so beer. no thanks. live and learn
This is packed on a Friday night! We had to wait for a little over an hour to get a table, we big party. It was well worth the wait! I've been here a couple of times for the beer and the Oatmeal Stout is by far my favorite! This was the first time we came here for dinner. The service was great even though the place was busy! Our drinks came out right away and the food was cooked to perfection! Definitely coming back! My only gripe is the lack of parking!
Busy place on a saturday night but they were able to accomodate our party of 12 within about 45 minutes. While we waited we had some beers at the very large bar they have at the front. Several TVs and not dissapointed the the beer. Hop Knot and the Kiltlifter are two of my favorite brews from this place. . . Food: this is my second time back and think it will be my usual when im ever in Tempe. Ordered the Filet, it had great flavor and cooked perfectly, not dry at all. Had the steamed veggies, which were realy good. They dont cook them all the way so they still have a crunch to them which I enjoyed. For apps get the calamari, they are long and larger than ive typically seen. Be sure to dip them in the spicy red sauce, it makes the app!. . Atmosphere: this place is packed. But it doesnt necessarily make you want to turn away. The service is great and staff is friendly. Youre in an older red brick warehouse style brewhouse, its a little noisy but as to be exoected for a restaurant this large. Really great atmosphere in my opinion,  unless youre looking for a quiet date night. TVs are in all directions so its a good place to watch the game as well. . . Overall 4 out 5 stars...its a solid choice in all aspects, but may not blow your mind. Ill definitely be back though!
Update! I found out that you can order the Veggie Beer bread the "old" way and they will make it for you how they used to. Hooray!
A pretty good hangout place. I was there with a coworker to grab a bite to eat. It was a Monday night so we we weren't planning to find much going on. This place had good ratings so we stopped by for some pub grub.. . It was actually a little busy here for 9 pm on a Monday. Lots of draft beer options and your typical bar food. I got a burger and a beer. Very in line with expectations. They used a pretzel bread bun, which are all the rage now, and meat cheese and bacon. A little dry but good. . . So I would say pretty good food but more of a hangout place than anything else.
I rolled into Tempe on a Friday evening and my friend told me to meet her here. We met at 6:30 and this place was BUMPIN. Totally packed, inside and out, and LOUD. The place to be on Friday night, apparently. I was told the wait for 2, first available, was about 35 minutes. That wait got longer for people showing up after us, real fast. . . I was starving so of course everything looked good on the menu. We started off with a cheese bread appetizer which was basically pizza when you factor in the dipping sauce. But oh so good.. . In terms of beer, I ordered their hef and their amber (seasonal), both of which were good. My friend got the peach ale which I tasted and wasn't too sweet, but not quite for me. She got one more I liked but not sure which it was. . . I couldn't decide what to order and the waitress said both things I was deciding between were good, so she didn't make it easier. I wound up going with the tenderloin sandwich. The filet was fantastic. Of course with the app and beer, even though I came starving, I couldn't quite finish the sandwich as it was pretty large. I made sure to finish the filet though, no way I was letting that go to waste! . . Great place to watch a game. Not so great to catch up and have a meaningful conversation.
Four Peaks never disappoints!  If it's your first time here get the sampler, all the beers deserve a try. My favorites include the seasonal Pumpkin Porter, Kiltlifter, 8th St Ale, & Hop Knot. The fish and chips and chicken fingers are both awesome. We always start with the pretzel appetizer.. Goes great with the beers and the mustard side is amazing. Service is always quick & friendly. I recommend going on a weeknight, but expect a crowd no matter the time you go. It's definitely worth the wait!
We come to the Phoenix area often and I've had the Four Peaks brews at various locations and really enjoy them. But I've never been to the brewery restaurant. We drove up and expected a long wait by the look of the number of people waiting out front but we're told it was only 15 minutes and true enough it was. . . I must say I was thoroughly impressed by Four Peaks Brewery. The service was outstanding! Our server Francesca was very knowledgeable about the beers offered and how they compare to what I and those in my party normally drink. Our glasses were never empty as well. I wish I could find servers like her everywhere we dine. . . The food was hot and delicious and quickly served. One of the managers, Mike, walked repeatedly around the restaurant, checking on all of the tables. Not only did he ask about the food and service but took the time to chat us up about where we were from and such. . . I would highly recommend Four Peaks Brewery!
We came as a party of 7 for lunch on a Friday and it was busy! Fortunately we were seated right away. The service here is exceptional. Our waitress was very prompt with bringing our drinks and food, and even with clearing our table. We enjoyed the peach ale and the Mexican coffee stout. We also tried the hefe. We enjoyed them all. The  peach ale was very peachy. The stout was chocolate and coffee flavored. The hefe tasted as described, with a strong banana aroma and flavor. We kinda felt that the same yeast was used on the hefe and the stout, as the stout had clover and banana flavors as well. Never the less, both were quite enjoyable. The fries are amazing, thick and flaky. We had the southwest burger and the chicken beer bread. The chicken beer bread is listed under sandwiches, but is much closer to a wrap. Instead of a tortilla, it is wrapped in a thick fluffy gordita style wrap. The southwest burger was not too spicy with a jalapeno aloli, and we liked pouring chipotle ranch over it. The burger was a little dry, even though we ordered it medium rare. Over all, we enjoyed the food, drinks, and service. Wish we would have happened to come for happy hour! Looks like beer is a dollar off for happy hour.
Went for the beers, stayed for the Bavarian pretzel with warm beer cheese. You should to.
I was in Phoenix for the weekend and stopped at about 6 breweries total. This was my favorite, hands down. I had a flight of all their beers (plus 3 seasonal offerings) and enjoyed them all. Normally not a fan of the Scottish styles but the Kilt Lifter surprised me. The service was quick, friendly, and the food was amazing. . . I will definitely be coming back to Four Peaks when I'm back in Phoenix.
This review is based on Customer Service only...our group of four was really excited to try this place out for dinner and maybe have a  few beers as we are HUGE craft beer fans we have a craft beer club and often look for new breweries to try because we do field trips with the club but on this occasion we were out for Spring Training. One of our group had his wallet stolen the day before and had planned to just have dinner with us we put in our name for dinner and were told that we would need to  show our ID's just to have dinner. That kind of took us back because we thought we were going to a restaurant anyhow that was a problem because as mentioned above one of our group did not have a wallet or ID either way if that is the rule I understand but what really upset us was how rude the security guard was and also that we saw at least 15 kids and teenagers sitting there eating food with their groups if it is a bar before a restaurant and you can't have anyone under 21 there then so be it but the fact that the same rules don't apply for everyone was the problem. The security guard could have simply said let me get the manager for you and see if they can do anything I'm sorry for the inconvenience etc but the answer was no you can't come in have a nice night that's it. Turned out it was the best thing that could happen to us because we ended up at the Pig and Pickle and it was one of the best meals I  have ever had and the service was amazing. Four Peaks Brewing I'm sure you have a cool thing going on there but I hope for your sake someone takes this as a learning experience and fixes the customer service issue
I was in Phoenix for a week for work. And I needed me some wings and cold beer. I happened across Four Peaks and made the comment to my colleagues that if I lived in Phoenix - and I would love to - this would be my hangout. . . Plenty of outdoor seating and lots of indoor seating. Fast, friendly service and lots of good vibes in the air. But the main attraction and star of the show is of course, the beer. . . I had a blonde ale and honestly could have drank about 10 of those suckers. But I was driving so alas, I had to be constrained. As it was, I knocked back 3 of those along with some wings and some beer bread appetizer that they make 2x a month. . . The wings were zingy and delicious. I got half with the peanut Thai sauce and the other with the hot buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing. And since I hate celery, got a double helping of carrots. I was not a fan of the Thai sauce at first. But once I went back to it, I loved it. I especially loved rolling the carrots in the Thai sauce. Don't know why. I just did. And the blue cheese dressing had to be homemade. Lots of blue cheese in there and nice and rich. . . And it all went with the beer sooooo well. And man, that beer was perfectly chilled and so damn fresh I felt as if the beer meister (is that the word?) just got through brewing it up. . . On the menu were about 10 or 12 types of beer but since it was hot and I wanted wings, I wanted a blonde ale. It went perfectly with the wings. . . One more thing. I would prefer a little more sauce on those wings but I'm sure I could have asked for some. I just loved the beer so much that I didn't really give a damn about the sauce. . . I go to Phoenix every year this time of the year for work. I'm already looking forward to heading out there next year for my return to Four Peaks.
great beer. great place. staff was awesome. went for a late lunch.  $70 check for lunch for 3 with flights of beer + a beer each.  Lots of great flavors to taste.
Wanted to update my review the GM Steve reached out to me and explained AZ law regarding our situation and also wanted to know the staff involved with the experience we had so he could talk to them and use it as a learning experience. I really appreciate the way he handled this so we will more than likely visit this place in the future ..thanks Steve !
OVERRATED, you can stop reading now that all you need to know.. . The food here is completely overrated. I think it's one of those local, established places that maybe had good food at one point, but then got lazy and sloppy in the kitchen. And now locals can't stop raving about it because it's the cool thing to do. Don't listen to that. I've been here a number of times and tired different things and for the most part it is bland a greasy. Especially the beer bread. Also this location has a way of making you feel awkward and unwanted at the door. There is always 4-5 hostesses and bouncers sitting at the front talking and laughing amongst themselves when you walk up. None of which seem to want to take their eyes away from twitter long enough to help you. And the bouncers always have a serious authority complex. And finally it's kind of out of the way, so forget about hailing a cab after a few beers, which aren't bad, but you can get them at any restaurant in the state. Save yourself the trouble and your business elsewhere.
Great beer, amazing food. Parking is the only drawback. It's like being in a real city.
This is my favorite spot by far! I wish I actually lived closer to this place so I could come here more often. The staff is really friendly and super helpful. I had asked to see what hops looked like and the manager on duty was kind enough to bring some over to my table and explain the process to me. She was kind enough to take time out of her busy day to answer questions and make me feel like I was the only customer in the room.  The food is delicious! There isn't anything on their menu that I don't like. My favorite is their nachos! Get half chicken and half beef, you'll have the best of both worlds. The beers are so refreshing! My favorite is the Oatmeal Stout. The beer is amazing! It's smooth and finishes with a hint of chocolate. It's super creamy! I think what I really love about this place is that they're always playing great tunes. Staff is great, food is great, beer is great, what's not to love?! I can't think of anything negative, except maybe the parking can be a bit of a hassle. That's not going to stop me from having an amazing time here!! Go check them out now!!
I was in town for the weekend, and caught up with an old friend here. I had cider (only one selection) and she had beer, and both were good. Nice atmosphere, very lively, and nice menu options. Our server was very attentive, and it was an all around good experience. We went on a Saturday, and only had to wait about 10 minutes before being seated, so not too bad for such a busy place!
Don't say that I didn't warn you, but if you are planning to get that buzz on, get the flight for yourself without sharing. S...t will get you happy, depending on how quick you drink it and how much food you have in your system. From experience with an empty stomach, and beer was my appetizer? Oh it was a fun experience, I'd say. . . I've tried their soup & sandwich. It's it includes a homemade cup of soup and half of a roasted turkey club or roast beef sandwich, and I had the turkey club. Not bad. There's also a soup & salad combo if you liked to eat that inside. Boyfriend got their French dip. French dip is roasted beef simmered in au jus, topped with swiss cheese and served on a hoagie roll. The order comes with either beer battered fries, pasta salad or salad. They usually serve their salad dressing on the side, which I like because I don't like my salad drenched in sauce and eat it soggy. . . Four Peaks also sells big jugs of growlers. I believe they are $15 per, and if you bring it back for refill of any kind, you'll get a discount. . . Great place to hang during the night or day. There are lots of big tv all around. Patio seats are available!
I came here with my hungry team after a competition and although I completely understand that 24 people at prime time is a HUGE party, I did not expect to wait for such a long time, especially after being told that it would take no more than 45 minutes to seat us.. . The main problem is...I feel like they didn't even TRY to seat us, hoping we would leave (probably because we were young).  As enormous waves of people spilled out and the lines outside emptied. We were /repeatedly/ told that our table would be ready in 10 minutes, but after another 30 minutes of waiting and the seaters avoiding eye-contact, we still were not seated.. . It took us about 2.5 HOURS to get seated, and our party had to be split up.. Also, those ladies at the front podium, get a better attitude. You gave dirty looks the entire night.. . Food and beer was fantastic, but it was NOT worth that terrible wait.. One star for the food, one star for the cool atmosphere.
This Brew Pub is down the street from Arizona State so you can expect it to be busy and loud. Parking is limited to the street and only one side of it at that. As I said the place is busy and there is a reason for that. The beer is very good as is the food. We only had appetizers, Bavarian Pretzels, Barrel Fries and Spinach Artichoke dip to help soak up the alcohol. The pretzels and fries were great, the spinach dip was meh. There was a lot of dip but it was just bland. On a whim the Wifey and my daughter got the Stoutamisu - Tiramisu but with oatmeal stout lady fingers. I'm not a big dessert fan but their Stoutamisu is great! We had a flight and decided  our favorite beer was the Kilt Lifter. Good place and if we're ever in town again, I plan on stopping by.
Awesome fries!! Excellent food and fast service. I always have a great time here. Seating is really hood be it outside or inside. This is a must try place.
Nothing like home made beer and steak. Clean positive apnosphere   Friendly staff. Clean restrooms. Parking not so easy. Well worth it to find.
Yummy food, nice crowd access it by Orbit Mercury, beer for days!
Meh...I love their drinks but I never go there hungry. Every time I hope the food is good and try something new and everytime I'm disappointed,its always really soggy and greasy...bleck!
A must stop in the Phoenix area.  Sunday brunch here doesn't get much better.  Everything here is fantastic!
