Went for the champaign brunch.  Not much diversity here and nothing particularly creative.  Roast turkey was moist and tasted good but that was about the only thing that left any impression on me.  As far as Vegas buffets go, I would only recommend this one for lovers of the bland.
Sad food. Sad place. This buffet is huge but there isn't a lot of food choices just a lot of seating. The line takes forever, short staffed. We ate there once and we were impressed. Next trip to Vegas tried it, it was bad. Tried it again, bad again. When we get the buffet pass we don't bother with Paris anymore after 2 bad experiences. There is much better food. I say it's a sad place because last June we were walking past when a gentleman was on the floor, EMS was performing CPR but being a medical professional I could tell he was already gone despite their best efforts. I've been to Vegas twice since then but never near that part of Paris, only Bally's.
Worst wait time ever.   Over 30 min. Servers are rude when confronted on the empty seats and the line not moving.
Last year my friend and I went to Vegas for vacation for a few days. We did the 24 hr. buffet and this was was our most favorite buffet. We practically ate here almost every meal.. . Love the food selections and the atmosphere is so nice. The line can get very long but it's worth it. Our favorite food is the mussels and the Alasken King Crab legs.
We bought the Buffet of Buffets pass and started our "journey" here. We also used the pass at the Planet Hollywood and Rio buffets, and thought Le Village was much better. We ended up eating her twice.. . The line was kind of annoying, and I swear that the buffets all like to take their time seating people to make sure there is always a queue. The servers were hit or miss, but Le Village is overall pretty good. The crepe stand is definitely worth your attention.. . If you know what to expect from Vegas Buffets you'll like this place. I made the mistake of assuming that these places would have mind-blowingly good food, but that's just not the case. Really, it's just a lot of "OK" food.
The food is so good here! I love French food, and fresh food! That is hard to find at a Buffet. Everything was so good, to bad my stomache was not as big as my eyes, I wanted more but I wa so full! I am very picky when it comes to food,  I am from Europe and hard to please!
We got the 24 hour buffet pass and came here for lunch. I started with a penne pasta dish that was delicious because it had a spiciness to it, I also got the pork and apples which was also quite well made. The prime rib was reallytender but a bit saltier than I would like. The roast beef was too tough to cut and to chew. I did get a pot pie that tasted pretty good as well. There were clams and crab legs and both were mediocre.. The crepes are pretty amazing and the fruits within are fresh. I had a variety of other desserts like the lemon tarts, creme brulee, flan, cake pops, cheese cake etc. I liked the tart and the creme brulee the best the flan and cake pops were far too sweet.. This is a good buffet compared to planet Hollywood, I think it was better, and almost comparable to Caesar's since it's not the extra $25. The wait staff was way more attentive than both Caesar and Planet Hollywood and asked us how we were throughout the dining experience. The decor was adorable as well.
Not a buffet lover but decided since that's Vegas I needed to try one. The Le Village Buffet was rated the best in Vegas and I can see why. The food was delicious and there was plenty of it. I can't imagine anyone making it through all the selections available. Please save room for dessert, I should have started here. I had the lunch buffet and the price is on the high end for Vegas buffets (but you are at the Paris) but worth the extra dollars to make sure you get good food. Very little wait but we were there on a weekday. As you pay for your meal you are asked if you want to add an additional amount for drinks. Do this if you are going to be drinking alcohol as more than one glass can pay for it. Dress was casual for lunch.
Love love this buffet for breakfast, so many yummy foods! Lunch is awful though, there isnever anything good. 5stars for breakfast 0 stars for lunch
Located in the famous Paris hotel where it's hard to miss the replicated Eiffel Tower, Le Village Buffet is an assortment of food with a wide range of food.. . I came here with my family, and we had made advanced reservations - lines are always super long for any of the buffets, and we were lucky enough to just enter without waiting for too long.  For some reason though, I feel that the hype of this place has died down considerably since being here 3-4 years ago.  Although there was a line, the dining room seemed pretty empty.  I notice that they reduced a number of their pastries and food items from previous years I've been here.  They really need to step up their game especially since there's a new buffet at Caesar's Palace.  I will say that the price is probably on the cheaper end in terms of LV buffets - I believe about $30 /person.. . The food quality was just okay.  I wasn't blown away and can't really give more stars.  The other LV buffets take it to the next level.  I'm doubtful about coming back here, but the macaroons and crepes are pretty good!
THE BEST $7 DINNER BUFFET (OR DINNER MEAL) EVER. . But wait wait a minute Gerald isn't the dinner buffet including taxes cost about $32 per person? Yes it does. Being a Total Rewards Card Member I was eligible to redeem $25 on food. I redeemed that amount and paid the difference of the buffet. Please note my review below isn't normally written for someone that paid the regular price, but someone who paid just $7 for dinner.. . The layout of food of this buffet is about one-fourth smaller than Bacchanal Buffet. However for this buffet my approach was similar to Bacchanal Buffet - get small portions on the plate. My goal was at least to get 7 plates so that I would only pay $1 per plate. I won't list all the items I ate, but I will highlight the items that stood out. The lamb leg, which is very French, wasn't gamey but flavorable because of the herbs. Since yesterday was St. Patrick's Day corned beef was served. Classical French dishes like pork and beans cassoulet and sausage and bratwurst choucroute garnie reminded me of dishes at Les Halles in New York. This buffet has a crepe station where your can order different types of crepes. Pork belly with apples is a classical French country dish. In the end I didn't end up getting seven plates of dishes; I got nine. A calculation that results in less than $1 per plate. You can say I got my monies worth.. . Whereas most buffets display random items of food, this buffet stands out because there are dishes from different regions of France. These regions act as a food station. When you go to a Chinese Food buffet you can tell the buffet is Chinese because of the food that is served. At this buffet you can tell the food is French because of the regional food station.. . Overall this is a decent buffet. In terms of quality and abundance of items this buffet isn't up to par with Bacchanal Buffet. However this buffet is much better in terms of quality and unique items than those Chinese buffets in the suburbs. You still be stuffed at this buffet, but you won't feel bloated as other Chinese buffets. . . Is Le Village Buffet worth $32? I'm not sure. Is Le Village Buffet worth $7. HELL YEAH!
I had heard this was one of the better breakfast buffets in LV. I don't have anything to compare it to but I thoughtit was great. It was $27 and it is all you can eat obviously but I just don't know how you could physically eat enough to justify the $27. . They do have SO MUCH to choose from it was a tad overwhelming. Definitely make a trip around just to look before deciding what you want. I went with a nutella crepe and it was fantastic. But who doesn't love nutella!? I also had a few other things that were also tasty. The coffee was not. Get a latte or something at the St. Louis walk up counter. Or better yet, a mimosa. It is Vegas after all! I had to go to a work conference or I would have!. We went at 7:30am on a Thursday. We had made reservations but ended up not needing them. Both evenings we were there a line was out the door. So I would suggest making a reservation through Open Table even if you end up not needing it. If you do make a reservation be sure to go to the VIP/special entrance. If you are coming from the rooms it is on the left before the regular entrance. I don't recall my reservation telling me to do this but after we sat down our waitress told us to do that if we came back and there was a line (assuming we had made reservations of course).. If I go back to Paris I'm not sure if I'll go again to this particular restaurant because of the cost vs what you can actually eat. They have a creperie where you can get the same crepes and pay about half of what I did.
When we checked in next door at Bally's, the man helping us mentioned this great 24hr buffet deal for $50 dollars. Basically he said you can visit ALL of the Caesar resorts buffets as much as you want for 24 hrs. We though this was an amazing deal, we could have lunch at the Paris, dinner at Caesar's, and breakfast somewhere else all for $50 dollars!. . We purchased our wrist bands at Paris and the woman said "Yes, this is good at ALL Caesar's resorts." We went to have dinner at Caesar's later that day and after checking in with the hostess she said "oh, you know you have to pay an ADDITONAL $30 per person, right?" WHAT?! What a total rip off. We should have known the "good deal" was too good to be true. They stamp a little thing on the back of your receipt stating "pay as little as $15 for upgrade to Caesars buffet." Who bothers to read the fine print on the back of a receipt? If we would have known it would have been extra, we would have never bothered. We also wouldn't have had to walk my 74 year old father clear across the strip for all the trouble. Paris didn't offer to do anything to rectify the confusion, and I really feel bad for other people falling for this "deal." . . All that being said, The Paris buffet had some good things to it in regards to food:. . The brioche French toast, the salmon, roasted sweet potatoes, the pasta dishes were all favorites. . . Some not so good:. Lack of fresh fruit and veggies - the salad offerings were very poor. . The crepe station...the "bananas" on the nutella crepes were mushy and weird, swimming in some sweet mystery liquid and then drenched in whipped topping and lord knows what else. . . Go across the way to "La Creperie" and pay $10 for a decent crepe.. . There are too many other places in Vegas to eat, I wouldn't come again,
When in Vegas you gotta check out this buffet. Amazing atmosphere. Great service. Delicious gourmet food with variety. No Golden Corral here. We have been several times and it never let's us down!
This buffet was quite the disappointment. The food didn't look appetizing and they still had breakfast food at 3pm. There weren't that many options and the options that were there wasn't great. Would not return.
