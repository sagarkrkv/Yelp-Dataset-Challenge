Amazing little patisserie!! I spend way too long staring at all the deserts! So much detail and so beautifully created. And the white, milk and dark chocolate water fall thing... Droooools. . . The little deserts are definitely affordable as well and tasty!
best best best! been there a few times and it's always the best i've ever had :)
eat nothing but an eclair... best in the country!
Anytime of the year I visit, Jean Philippe Patiserie never ceases to amaze me! . They are brilliant at what they do, and their ideas are so exciting and new..they are constantly "wowing" people taking pictures with their cake designs, and scrumptious desserts. . . I always find myself strolling in here "just to look" at what they have to offer, but end up leaving with bag fulls..they look too good to pass up!. . Below are a list of things I've gotten from here (Some multiple times.. too irresistible!). . Medium Box of Chocolates $56.25 without tax included (25 pieces) .  It's assorted, so "Flavors may include:. Anise, amaretto, banana, caramel, cinnamon, coconut, coffee praline, crispy chocolate, dark chocolate, gianduya, lemon, mint, orange, peanut orange, pistachio, praline, and vanilla rum."  Honestly, do yourself a favor and get a box of chocolates! They come in a nice package so it'll also make for a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one! . . -Raspberry Candies $15 (6.3 oz.) . "These hard candies are as refreshing as they are tasty. The bright, slightly tart flavor of raspberry is blended with sugar to create a candy that is delicate yet tangy. These raspberry candies are the perfect balance of tart and sweet." . . Artisan Jam -Strawberry $12 (8 oz.). "Each one of these flavorful jams are handmade in small batches ensuring the ultimate in freshness.... Using a high-ratio of fruit, and a low amount of sugar results in a jam that is high in flavor and low on fillers.". . Pure Wild Flower Honey $12 (8.5 oz.). "These honeys' are carefully hand-packed to ensure the utmost in flavor preservation. Aromatic wild flower hone is a delightful addition to any baked good or cup of tea.". . Caramel Popcorn $9.95 (7 oz.). "This classic American snack is the perfect compliment of sweet and salty. Light, fluffy kernels of popcorn are covered with a thin caramelized sugar coating...". . -Key Lime $7.57 w. tax included. Key Lime Emulsion, Almond Dough, Whipped Cream . . -Rose Macaroon. Raspberry Macaroon, Rose Infused Cream, Fresh Raspberries. $7.57 w. tax included. . -Raspberry Tart. Raspberry, Pistachio Cream . $7.57 w. tax included. . -Strawberry Tart . Mousseline Cream, Almond Macaroon, Almond Biscuit . $7.57 w. tax included. . -Raspberry Napoleon . Fresh Raspberries, Vanilla Cream, Puff Pastry Dough . $7.57 w. tax included. . *We've also gotten a box of French Macaron's to enjoy when we got back home... but they were quite brittle so I'm not sure if maybe we waited too long? I don't recall the price but I believe it was roughly $16 for the box if my memory serves me right. . . On a side note, the JPP at the Bellagio has a floor-to-ceiling chocolate fountain that's been certified by the Guiness World Records as the worlds largest chocolate fountain! (But sorry, before you bring your own strawberries... it's glass enclosed!)
OMG!!!  Best sticky buns ever.  Everything we ate there was delicious.  I cant wait to come back.  The oatmeal cookie was really yummy too.  Next time I want to get some chocolate.  King Sugar Showcase Supreme!!!
When I first sawthis place I knew I had to eat here. The decor itself is gorgeous. The rotating layer cakes around the store and special Zarkana display, which are decorated extravagantly, are simply works of art. I was only able to try the Triple Chocolate dessert which is a chocolate mousse with dark chocolate ganache-like coating, white chocolate cremeux inside, and a chocolate filled macaron on top. Needles to say I was in chocolate heaven! The chocolate is so light and smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. If I lived in Las Vegas I would probably come every day. Sadly I will have to wait until next time I visit to try more of Jean Phillipe's creations.
Hello!?! It's JEAN PHILLIPE!!! My eyes were just going bonkers looking at all the different chocolates that were available. The desserts were so eye catching and tons of souvenirs!!! They have food such as salads, sandwiches, etc. Along with coffee and tea selections. The staff was EXTREMELY helpful and so kind. I had the Opera (chocolate mousse type cake) and a vanilla eclair. THE VANILLA ECLAIR IS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!! The cream is on the thicker side and it's the perfect size for your buck! The cafe latte is very good too, smooth and creamy and perfect with the sweet desserts. . . Souvenir wise I got the coconut and chocolate macaroons, white chocolate covered pistachios, and coconut tuilles. Every single one of them was so good! The chocolate is such high quality and not too sweet. Gotta stop by whether you buy something or not!
So flawless.. So fancy.. So modern.. So delicious.. So creative. . So expensive. . So worthit.
If delicious food and great dessert is your cup of tea, then you're in for a real treat. If you've eaten macarons (macaroons as most would spell it) from Laduree, Pierre Herme, Bottega Louie or 'Lette (just to name a few), then you understand what a good quality macaron is! Jean Philippe's macarons are up to par with all of those!. . Get their rose macaron with custard and fresh raspberries. It's an oversized macaron and not overly sweet as the rose flavored custard and raspberries complement each other very well (I know you're mouth is watering now). Shoot, grab yourself two while you're at it!. . Their sandwiches and wraps are damn tasty too! If you're not super hungry and want something that isn't so heavy, grab yourself a croissant sandwich or wrap (I opted for the chicken pesto wrap). . . Though not necessarily cheap (we spent more than $40 for 2 sandwiches, a cup coffee, another cup of OJ and a macaron), it's well worth your money for some damn good eats! . . Have someone get in line to order while one of you grab a seat first as this place gets pretty damn packed. The line is always a good 20 minute wait. And there are 2 lines, one for their food and one just for the chocolates and smaller sized desserts, just a FYI!. . P.S. - Aria offers free valet parking. But don't come here just for this place if you don't plan on gambling and hanging around Aria.
This is one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.  I love everything about it. It's casual but the food is of the highest quality. The line moved rather quickly and they have everything you can think of....... Pastries, chocolates, coffee, sandwiches, gelato.  It's all amazing.  Today I ordered a croissant sandwich, coffee, cinnamon roll and later in the day I made another stop and got some gelato.. . The croissant sandwich was filled with generous portions of fresh turkey and sharp cheddar cheese.  I loved the cranberry relish and the sprouts gave it that crunch.  They have mayo and mustard in packets... I just add mayo to make it more decadent and rich.  WHY NOT!. . OK.......You must get their cinnamon roll.  It's huge and has great cinnamon flavor.... It's buttery, flakey and moist all at the same time.....The cream cheese frosting is where it's really at though.  I could prolly just eat batches of that icing.... Good thing I don't work there..... I would be swiping my finger across the top of a cinnamon roll on "accident" every 15 minutes..... . Coffee at Jean Philippe is pretty pricy... Espically if you add any flavors or an add shot..... An Iced latte with some vanilla and an add shot could be upwards of $7/$8. But hey, you're in Vegas.... Starbucks is just as pricy!. . Last but certainly not least is their gelato.  It's rich, creamy and tastes all natural... Like it was just made in back with love and care. It probably was! The oreo cookie and espresso gelato was the perfect way to end my day of pure spa bliss at ARIA.. . One of the great things about Jean Philippe is that it's in prime people watching territory..... Just don't let them see you shoving a cinnamon roll in your face, they will stare.
Excellent pastries!. . Their croissants are amazing. This place and Bouchon Bakery are two of my favorite patisseries on the strip.. . It's located near the north valet entrance facing Vdara, which makes it more approachable for residents in Panorama Towers and The Martin. It's a five-minute walk using Harmon Bypass Bridge over I-15.
I'm a huge fan of their creme brulee and their chocolate covered strawberries are to die for. Their pastry case is fantastic and I've been able to call in orders ahead if time. Their staff is usually friendly but when they are busy can get frazzled. The only disappointment for me was their cappuccino. I've given it a couples of chances but not a fan.
everything here is incredible....  that is all.
