Unlike the review from the 22nd we were treated exceptionally. We are a younger couple without the glitz and glam but we were treated like royalty. Perhaps the difference was the server. In our case we had Paul and he was absolutely awesome.   . . Before going on with the review let me back up a bit. We were looking for a place to eat that night and were walking through the Bellagio when my wife said, "That Olives restaurant has a balcony but it is first-come, first-serve so we probably could not get out there.". Me being the kind of guy who would rather ask and get told "no" than not ask at all went up to the hostess and asked about any openings on the balcony. To my amazement I was told there would be a table for two in 45 minutes if I cared to wait. With the night being beautiful and a chance to sit outside and eat we readily agreed to wait. Approximately 30 minutes later we were led out to the balcony and seated. The balcony is small, I'd venture to guess there was enough space for about 30 people. I do not know for sure but I believe the tables directly next to the edge overlooking the Bellagio Fountain were reserved for Black Card (mlife) holders which we were not. We were seated at the back of the balcony but we could still see the fountains and had a beautiful view of the strip. (We also just happened to be seated at 7pm when the fountains played every 15 minutes so we saw the whole line up of songs during our dinner...I highly recommend this timing). . . Like I said in the beginning, Paul was our server and he was wonderful. He treated us like we were special though we were not in suits, not bedazzled in jewelry, and certainly no high-roller status. We were dressed nicely though a few on the balcony were dressed very poorly even for a casual dining restaurant. We were served with smiles and warmth as was everyone else out there including the poorly dressed group though by a different server.. . Paul even took our picture for us with our camera during what he called "Picture time". He had an excellent sense of humor that matched ours which seems hard to do these days. He made our night. . . The customer service, view, and fountains were amazing but the food...boy was that some of the best food we have eaten in a while. The drinks were made perfectly, the complimentary bread basket paired with the Olive Tapenade was one of a kind. Delicious! The flat bread...well it did not last long. For entrees my wife ordered the chicken and I ordered Salmon. My meal was perfect, my wife's chicken was overdone but still tasty. We could have probably requested a new one but it was not inedible and it was still very delicious so we did not. We were too full for dessert though what I saw others eating looked amazing. . . Overall, an excellent experience and I would go back if I was back in Vegas. I also highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious meal. If you are willing to wait for the balcony I would do it and try to time it for the more frequent fountain shows. Well worth it! . . Try to get Paul as he was amazing, though the rest seemed equally as awesome.
The steak tartare and tuna tartare were both awesome!
The best thing about this place is the view of the fountain. That said, best to be on the patio or near the window. The flat breads were delicious. However the larger plates were all very average. The soft shell crab pasta was pretty bland and the steak sandwich a bit tough. Stick apps and drinks and enjoy the view.
Ate here with family during a trip to Las Vegas, we stayed at the Bellagio and had some coupons to eat here. We decided to try it out.. . The food was delicious. Service was friendly. Atmosphere is great.
I have to give Olives a 5 star review for the amazing service and view we had at dinner.  We had reservations at 7 on a Tuesday for 5 people. We showed up at 6pm had drinks at the bar and asked for a table outside and that we were willing to wait for it.  We had the perfect table outside and were seated right at 7pm. The service was top notch and everyones meal was very good.
A beautiful & fancy place for a nice dinner out in Las Vegas. I went with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday and we were lucky enough to get a table out on the patio. Getting to sit out there with the fountain show was lovely! It very much was a classy Vegas experience. The menu has a lot of good choices, including things for vegetarians. . . I had the mushroom papardelle, which was quite delicious but a little too rich if you want to go out after dinner. The mushrooms were wonderful, the pasta noodles were so good, and the peas & pea shoots helped take some of the edge off the creaminess. The menu mentioned truffle essence but I didn't catch any of that. At $34 a plate, it's definitely a lot, but it was a very large portion and had I been going back to my room there would have been enough to put in a take away box for later. My husband had the ricotta & sausage ravioli, and devoured it.
Total waste of money. It might be worth it if you sit outside to view the fountains but that would be it. It was so loud inside that my wife and I gave up on trying to yell out a conversation and communicated by hand signals. A loud restaurant I can forgive, but the food was also poorly cooked and flavorless. My Ribeye, if it even was a Ribeye, was cut so thin it could have been a skirt steak. It was also burnt and greasy. Then they covered it in a bland red wine reduction that literally had no flavor. My wife's chillian sea bass was dry and her beans were under cooked and hard. The only saving grace was the bread and tapenad. Never again.
Food was great, but that bar tender Jon was easy on eyes too. I would mind going back for the view, and I ain't talking about the fountain.
Very dark place inside so don't eat here if you like to see your food. Sitting on patio would make all the difference. Wouldn't eat here unless you're seated outside.. Food: . Rolls /relish too salty.. I had chicken entree $29 , average at best, pretty dry.. Wife had butternut squash ravioli...a bit soupy with more butter than butternut...
Perfect dining experience!! Lovely restaurant &'atmosphere. Impeccable service & fabulous food!! I'll be back!!
