This is da bomb for BBQ in Vegas and what's even better it's not packed full of tourists yet very close to the strip.  Don't be afraid of the office park feeling, get in and get down and bone greasy with some tasty sauce....I'd recommend the brisket. YUM. . Oh and bring your appetite, portions are solid.
Amazing Bbq from start to finish. Meatloaf is a must, jalapeno coleslaw is an awesome twist
"DAMNNNNNN GOOOOOD! DAMNNNNNNN GOOOOOD! DAMMMMMMMMMMMMM GEWD!". . Those three words are the celebratory chants of a Rollin Smoke Barbeque meal. Alright so maybe the chef will encourage you to shout it when you leave, but it takes little convincing, trust me!. . My knowledge of barbeque is limited, but I mean I own a Traeger Grill, does that count for anything? No? I didn't think so either... but while my Traeger makes deliciously smoked clean meats it doesn't compare to the smokey glistening glory of RSB. Their ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ is what makes Vegas or America in general really freaking awesome. I mean sure we're in the top 10 for most obese countries, but hey at least we do it right, RIGHT? . . The special is $25 and includes EVERYTHING on the menu, except drinks ($2), you gotta buy that, BUT... its pretty much all you can drink too. Don't pass on the Outlaw Burger,  the beef ribs, or the nachos, but do pass on the pulled pork. Don't wear a belt, its useless, no belt will make look skinny after the massacre. You can of course also just order ala carte.. . Take the booth with the pig, it will give you extra encouragement when you savage through his four legged cousins. . . CONVENTION PEOPLE... COME HERE!. . How was my review? DAMNNNNNNN GEWDDDDDDDDDD right? Thanks!
Came here on a rainy friday afternoon with Doriee, at 1pm, hoping to run into the Travel Channel filming crew. We did, but apparently filming started at 11 instead of the posted time of noon (oh well). We met up with Roger, as well as invited one other friend. . . Location, actually not as hard to find as i had thought. Though i had "scouted" the place a few days prior, still wasn't hard as some may have said. Coming from Fashion Show or Mel Tourne, taking a right onto industrial, then left at the light, then right again, and you are pretty much there ! . . Restaurant is a little small but lots of seating. Parking wise, decent amount. Unless there was some specific thing going, should be parking avail. . . Upon entry, first thing you see is their huge menu on the wall. Since Doriee was on break and didn't want to eat too much, we decided to share. And being "marketed" the beef rib so much by Roger (steak on a stick is what he calls it), we opted to get the Rib Platter Special. Comeswith one side and a drink. For the side, we got the corn nuggets ! Or rather Doriee "excitedly" shouted corn nuggets XD ! Since she was on her lunch break (1 hour time, but work was close by), we hoped it wouldn't take long. Upon ordering, we were told about 25 minutes. . . Rib Platter Special - $17.99 - 3 Baby Back Ribs, 2 Spare Ribs, and 1 Beef Rib - Ordered with a side of Corn Nuggets. . . To our surprise, it came in about 20 minutes or less. Good on timing !! :D. . Pretty big platter. Was definitely a good sharing size between the two of us. Corn nuggets were piled on the side. To our surprise (again), the corn nuggets were pretty good. Corn gave it a nice sweetness and it was nice and crispy ! The sauce it comes with is like a mix between thousand island and like the sauce from Raising Canes. Sweet, little tangy. . . Now the main entree. Ribs. The so-called "steak on a stick" was a beef rib that had a lot of meat on it, as well as a pretty thick layer of fat. The meat was not how i imagined it to be. Yes, as the restaurant name suggests, smokey, definitely a lot of smokey flavor (lasted the rest of the day lol!) but the meat broke off like it was stewed meat? I'm not sure if its because beef ribs weren't one of my favorite type of rib or its been too long since i had a beef rib but it was quite disappointing. Flavor was decent but meat texture wise, a little different. Both the baby back ribs and spare ribs were, yet again, smokey, but to our disappointment again, it was quite dry. Would have preferred it to be a little more seasoned/marinated to give it a nice flavor instead the meat but the dryness of the meat kind of made it saddening. Tried to help it with the bbq sauce on the table, but didn't really help. . . The BBQ sauce was a very thin sauce, so if you were to put in on anything, it almost rolls right off. Flavor wise, sweet, tangy, spicy. Not bad but not my favorite either. . . The following two items were ordered by Roger and another friend but im just putting what i SEE :P . . The Outlaw Burger - $8.99 - Brisket, Onion, Bell Pepper, Onion Strings, Red Cabbage Slaw, Lettuce, Tomato, Cheddar Cheese, and Chipotle Aioli. . HUGE burger. The burger is, i believed a confirmed 1lb patty with tons of stuff stacked on top. Roger tried to press it down to make it smaller to eat, but to no avail. That burger was DENSE ! Not too much of a burger person but looked pretty good ! Maybe could try, if it was split with someone half n half.. . . Brisket Dog - $8.99 - 1/4 Lb Beef Hot Dog, Brisket, Smothered in Cheese and Onion Strings. . I didn't even notice the hot dog in it until after my friend bit into it. Similar to the burger, ingredient filled/stacked. I was actually surprised my friend ate it fairly cleanly without everything falling out and onto the plate. . . Desserts !!!. . Southern Peach Cobbler & Country Black Berry Cobber - sweet and flavorful. sauce was very thin and runny. kind of hard to eat (especially if you were sharing. would prefer the sauce to be a little thicker. still pretty good ! . . Mama's Banana Pudding - imagine a bread pudding but instead of bread, its vanilla wafers... with slices of banana and pudding. Yummy dessert :P . . Reese's PB Cup Bread Pudding - soaking in a RUM sauce, the dense but flavorful bread pudding is like hell on a plate. bread pudding usually is already pretty flavorful from it absorbing the heavy cream but in this case, it is a PEANUT BUTTER CUP bread pudding... rich peanut butter taste with a nice rum sauce glaze on top. Prob my fav on the 4 desserts listed. . . Overall. good place. though the ribs were a bit disappointing. Everything else was pretty good. Would like to try other things, like their brisket and such
best BBQ ever great taste nice portions great customer service and talk with owner Mom on the phone best potato salad ever
---Rant---. . Great place when you are starving for meat!!!. . Generally I stick with Tri-Tip, Chicken and/or Brisket when trying a new place.  These guys did NOT disappoint!  Meat was tasty, flavorful and juicy (not overly greasy, just juicy).. . The Chicken was cooked perfectly and unusually soft (in a good way), same with the beef. . . The cornbread is excellent...tastes like it has a lot of butter, which is pretty damn good IMHO~. . The seating sucks though; I had to have ma boy buy my grub while I went and sat in an open booth. There was a huge crowd of folks waiting to order (you order first, pay then go sit.  They bring you your food).  I kinda got some disappointed looks from the crowd as I apparently was the only one smart/clever enough to go grab seats while your buddies are ordering for you?! haha. . Side Note 1 - Don't ask the staff if they have any to-go containers...they will look at you like a total dumbass as containers are plainly visible at the counter, next to the soda and utensils hahaha (the dude just rolled his eyes and pointed, I in turn looked a damn fool~ hahahaha). . Side Note 2 - This is on a side street that has about 4-5 strip clubs. The street itself is dark and looks like the kind of area you could get mugged, raped, etc.  So go with a nice sized group of people if you're gonna go at night, and bring tazers or mace~. . ---Overall---. . Service: A.  We got our food pretty quick~. . Food: A. Great food if you're looking for a heavy meat fix!!!. . Atmosphere: C.  If I wasn't worried about getting ass-raped, I would probably visit more often.
Theonly thing I can suggest is needs more smoke or different type of wood. Smoke ring needs to be better.I come form the Midwest and smoke meat all the time not as good as them or even close but this is my opinion. The other is need more moisture. But great potions great price you need to get there ASAP.
Never disappointed. Always awesome food. From the Outlaw Burger to Spudtastic, it's great BBQ.  The brisket is moist, not wet like some places serve it.  They found the right balance of smoke and the meat's flavor.  Plus they offer solid sides and desserts.  If you are a BBQ enthusiast or a casual diner, Rollin Smoke is tops in Vegas.  Take the time to seek it out.
The Beef Ribs were cooked (smoked) perfect, easily the best Ive ever had (and Ive had my share)..Tender and mouth watering would be the best description. Met the owner and one of his son's, they were the type of people you would invite to sit at your dinner table and talk BBQ with, just nice folks. My wife had the smoked meat loaf and it was awesome also..The BEST BBQ in Las Vegas hands down
Vegetarian?  Here's a pickle.  This is the carnivore's domain.. . Note:  Everything I know about BBQ, I learned on TV.  I've been to Memphis, Kansas City, and Dallas and never had a lick of the stuff.  Even better, growing up in Hawaii, we boiled our ribs before grilling them.  I'm quite the expert.  But.... . The wafting aroma of sweet hickory smoke.  The earthy, mild spice rub that has deeply penetrated the proteins; a moist, beefy rib with tender sinew and rendered fat;  fall off the bone baby backs; "suckably" delicious cartilage of toothsome spareribs, and glistening slices of brisket.  The acrid, bitterness of the smoke ring in strong contrast to the almost sweet meat.   Food porn!. . The sauce has a good vinegar kick that helps to cut the one dimensional flavor and cloying, richness that becomes more difficult to take the more you eat and the colder it gets.  . . Their signature, bigger than any human's mouth, stuff falling out, BBQ sauce on your face "outlaw" burger is good eats.  Brisket, sauteed onions, peppers, fried onion strips, slaw, veg, cheese and a chipolte aioli; what's not to love?. . Remaining menu items less successful.  The breaded catfish and shrimp are both overcooked and rubbery.  The smoked meatloaf, excessively smoky and bitter.  Deep fried sides often oily with one exception, the outstanding cream corn nuggets.  Crispy on the outside, rich creamy corn goodness on the inside.. . Prices are very reasonable for the quantity.  The $24.99 AYCE a winner; anything on the menu, one price.. . The worthy indulgence is not without cost.  Suffice it to say, remember waking up from a drunken stupor after having smoked your first cigar?  All the mouthwash in the world...
Meat, meat, meat! The Outlaw Burger was AMAZING. Piled so high it was difficult to fit it in my mouth. It was worth the effort! :). The ribs had a great flavor and the texture was perfect.  Pull off the bone delicious. Add the banana pudding. You won't regret it. Best banana pudding I've ever had, and I've eaten a monkeys share of banana pudding.
Phenomenal!  This is hands down the best barbeque in Las Vegas.  The real deal!. . We ordered, didn't have to wait for very long, and really enjoyed our meal. I had pulled pork and brisket duo, and it did not disappoint.  Sauce on the table went to good use.  My husband had an all you can eat with ribs that fell right off the bone.  He also tried shrimp and rib tips, which he said were terrific.  Hushpuppies were seasoned to perfection and the sides were all delish!!. . Definitely adding this to our list of regular stops!  And check in for a dessert, the banana pudding was awesome.
Super busy line went quick food was fast. Sides are great gonna go back and try more side. Beans and mac&cheese down
This place is great.  Its a hidden gem that is busy during lunch time, but worth the wait.  Trio combo is the best deal.  Everything is tasty, jalapeno slaw is delicious! . One recommendation is to not over cook the brisket!   Lately its been dry and chewy...not savory, tender, juicy, fatty, flavorful :(
This place is amazing!!!  The smoked beef ribs are ridiculous.  The pork ribs are so good.  Best chicken wings I have ever had, they are also smoked!  The smoke does 98% of the flavoring and the BBQ sauce is the final enhancement.   The mac n' cheese is creamy and rich.  The guys that work there are really friendly and helpfull.  This will be a stop for me every time I come back to Las Vegas!
Hard to find bbq in Vegas - found it! Will be going back to taste more items! Anytime the man who takes your order, and comes out to ensure your food is good by your first name tells you they take pride! Cheers to those spare ribs, brisket and pulled pork!
Had the smoked meatloaf dinner with loaded mashed and greens tonight. It was slap your mama great!!! Defiantly going back for more!!
The fam bam loved it. Fast easy and delicious.  The hardest part was choosing what to eat on the menu cause we wanted everything!!!
This place was simply delicious. Perfect recipe for what makes these types of places last. Great food and great service. That's it. That's all it takes. All you chain restaurants out there thinking that your name speaks for itself, do yourself a favor and check out Rollin Smoke. This is how it's done. Keep it up guys. You're doing an awesome job!!
Good Food! Was out in Vegas for friends bday and decided to go there and eat instead of eating out of casino or on strip. Maybe 10 minutes away from "Rio" and its the real deal on BBQ. Friendly and fast service. Clean tables as well. I will be back whenever I am in the town!
Absolutely amazing food. Friendly atmosphere. We live in town and love this place.  Will definitely be back soon! !
Rollin Smoke BBQ is awesome. Found this place on a Yelp search in Vegas where we were just looking for good BBQ. Great menu, food came out quick, prices reasonable. Love the picnic tables out front & the old throw back setting. Totally dig that it's located under a freeway exit off the beaten path. Keep Rollin !!
If you like bbq go no further! ! Real smoke.  Girl did the. Chicken and pulled pork,  loaded mashed.  I did ayce only $24.95 & when they say anything off the menu they were not joking.  First round 2 beef ribs super tender just enough cooking tender juicy sweet,  baby back ribs. Beans out of bounds,  steak beans with black pepper,  cayenne spicy good. Mac cheese meah. 2nd round brisket and baby backs so yummy tender brisket smoke rings all with pickles and whitebread. Red onion straws and needed cool off had Dessert blue bell ice cream Hershey chocolate syrup.. Seriously don't bother going anywhere else. Hard part I'm 300 miles from home in OC. Tell Dusty pit boss Michael the foodie from OC sent you.
Bookmarked this one.  I dont want to forget it.  Not that I could.  Exceptional pulled pork. Lots of smoke.  . . Try the corn nuggets.
One of the few places left in town that understand and shares my love for beef ribs. Although I've had all there stuff and it's always amazing. Noting is better to me than a nice fat juicy beef rib! Thanks so much guys your all scholarly gentlemen :)
Service was super friendly and fast, but I am perplexed at the high average rating.  . . We got to try several items on the menu w/ the $25 AYCE deal and pretty much found everything to be just ok.  The pork and brisket were on the dry side and the ribs did not fall off the bone.  The meatloaf, onion strings and outlaw burger were tasty.  The best thing we had were the corn nuggets - fried creamy goodness!  Mac and cheese and loaded mash were ok.  Desserts had so much potential but didn't deliver.  Their sundae was ice cream with a little choco sauce on top, nothing else.  Banana pudding and peach cobbler were meh.. . If you do go, don't have too high of expectations based on Yelp.
Great hole in the wall- just off the strip. Finally found a BBQ place in Vegas that is worth going to.  The pit special gives you the sampler of their BBQ. The Biggin is the best for the buck. Corn nugget is so yummy.
Yes, I finally rolled in to Rollin Smoke after the many raving reviews from my Yelp Peeps.  I am super WAY over due for this joint.  I do think I have told at least 15 people about this place since our visit last Saturday.  If that doesnt say how I feel about this place, how about the leftovers that I ate for breakfast the next day.  Yes, I must say this is simply (but not simply stated) the best BBQ I have ever EVER had.. . Dont let the location fool you...its part of its finger lickin good charm and you cant beat the smell of pure goodness when you pull into the parking lot.  When we first arrived a couple was leaving voicing that they will be back next year - as they come here every year when they visit Vegas.  I think that says alot too.. ...a must have for tourists too?!. . We both ordered the sliders-both coming with 3 and you can pick what meat you want.  I had the chicken and the brisket while my man had the chicken, brisket and the hot link sliders.  He said the hot links were his favorite-IF there could even be a favorite.  All of it was totally fab.  For sides we had the waffle fries and the mac and cheese.  The waffle fries were sprinkled with a sweet and salty flavoring that I loved and I'm still craving and wont be satisfied until I have more.  The mac and cheese was super creamy.  I thought it was very good.  Alot of the times mac comes out all dry and coagulated.  Not the case here.  I could literally eat a big bowl of it and call it a day.  ***ehem But I wouldnt recommend it only because there is SO much more important things to savor.  Lets talk about the meat - yes their slogan is that they "rub their meat" and however you take it consider that some good lovin (hehe).  The meat is smokey and savory....meat with FLAVOR!  The sauce was perfect (not too sweet, not too thick)-and Im very picky about sauce.   The portions were so huge.  I'm sure the guy thought I was not sure what I was getting into when I ordered the 3 sliders.  I brought home 1 1/2 that was leftover and like I said I think I must have been dreaming about it all night because I did have to dig into that first thing the next morning.  As I opened the box all I could smell was the smokey heavenly goodness and I knew right then it was going to be a good day.. . So yeah on Wednesday I was sat down and asked to not be mad.....hmmm yes my man went there for lunch without me.  And YES damn right I was mad.  LOL  Yes, peeps....it is JUST THAT GOOD.  I cannot wait to go back.  Well heck Ive already checked into the catering menu so I can order for my next party.  If you are looking for a winner.....this is IT.   . . *side note...they are closed on Sundays.  :(
Met Big Mike who gave great recommendations for our groups food! You must the beef rib and brisket burger. The beans and fried okra  for a side were on point and you can't go wrong with any of the food here.  Bring everyone and the price won't kill ya!  A must have in Vegas.
Best BBQ and amazing people! We tried almost everything on the menu. You must try the fried okra! They were so nice and friendly we will definitely be back.
oh my . . We got the pit special, outlaw burger, Mac and cheese, kickin beans, loaded mash, onion strings, catfish, and corn fritters! you can just taste the smokiness from the BBQ! so much flavor. . . I loved the kickin beans, it has brisket and has a perfect sweet and spicy kick! . . the catfish is cooked perfectly and is a must, it comes with two sauces, but is also good on it's own. . . the best thing was the corn fritters, OH MY GOD. I don't think a gallon of this would be enough  sweet corn and cheese deep fried nuggets. I could eat this all day. if I had to order one thing only it would be this. . . a place can have the most amazing food but the last star can only be earned by amazing customer service. thank you to MIKE for helping us out! you can tell this place truly cares about their customers leaving satisfied. if I could give an extra star just for how amazing the service is alone I would. will definitely come back!!. . hands down the best bbq I have ever had! it was only appropriate to sit next to the piggy at our table since that's what I felt like while I was eating. oh and I don't know why there's two $$ signs, the prices are so cheap! definitely bang for your buck!
My fellow lunch buddies and I were craving barbeque last week, but couldn't find seem to find a good spot. On our quest for barbeque, we found Rollin Smoke Barbeque. OMG this place is amazing and a hidden gem. Definitely off the beaten path, but well worth the drive. I had the Pulled Piggy Sandwich with Onion Rings and their Peach Cobbler. Their pulled pork was amazing. The meat was so soft & tender. Definitely going to recommend to anyone that's craving barbeque.
I normally dont like beef ribs becuase they are tough, but these were the best ive ever had
I love the clever menu like the BBQ Nacho Fries, BBQ Sundae, & the Outlaw Burger. . . The $8.99 Smokin Deals are a great value
What a Gem.  I am a Weekend BBQ ER  the food is awesome and the service was great too. I'm afraid this place is so so good that it won't be my secret anymore.
Friendly accomodating staff, large menu selection and very good bbq. A must visit for the bbq fan.  Excellent customer service.  Very easy to find. We had pulled pork and briscuit.
Awesome BBQ! Can have it mild or crazy insane hot. The sides are good and the yams are off the hook. Best yams I've ever had.
The Outlaw Burger is the meal cheat days were made for!. It's gigantic and completely acceptable to share, weighing a monstrous amount and nearly filling an entire takeout box. Piled high with juicy, flavorful brisket (tastes like Texas!), crispy fried bell pepper and onion strings, cheddar cheese, and chipotle aioli, this thing is packed with big, bold flavors. The red cabbage slaw adds the perfect bit of crunch and acidity, bringing what could be an overwhelming mouthful flying back into foodie heaven.. I would put this on the shortlist of requests for final meals, and that's a big deal- coming from Texas, it feels sacrilegious to list a NV barbeque joint higher than one back home, but this burger is beyond amazing and I'm pretty sure I'm going to have wet dreams about it.. . Initially we were turned away because they had "just closed" only for the owner to come chasing after us, insistent that we could still be served. Right after our order was placed, a family walked in and were turned away. I'm flattered and grateful that we made it in under the wire, but maybe turn off all of the neon flashy BBQ lights if you're closing so that you don't have to ruin anyone's day!
Hidden gem in Las Vegas. Walked in and immediately knew I was gonna love this place. Got the pit special with brisket, pulled pork and spare ribs. Great flavor with a slight hint of a spicy kick. Sides were awesome too, tried the corn nuggets, mac n cheese and fried onion strings, Delicious, Definitely wanna try their All You Can Eat $24.99 Deal. Servers were friendly, food came out quickly and loved the atmosphere, Cant wait to goback and bring people visiting from outta town.
Met up with some local Vegas friends on our last visit out there. This restaurant is hidden, located very close to a strip club, in a dark plaza, windows are tinted, and is missing a bouncer outside. However once you step in, it's like being in Texas again.. . You order up at the counter and take a seat. They bring your food to you. The cashier was cool and even know how to say my name correctly. Respect given. . . Like any good BBQ joint, they better give you a good bang for your buck. I expect finger licking seasoned grilled meats and a slew of sides. They sure didn't disappoint. They sure know how to rub their meats!. . Brisket: Seasoned perfectly. The best brisket in Vegas. Spare Ribs: Fall off the bone and flavorful. Chicken: Not dry and seasoned very well. Mashed potatoes: Buttered and smooth just the way I like it. Yams: Sweet and juicy. Corn Nuggets: Awesome deep fried corn nuggets. Never had these before. . Everything pretty much was on par with great BBQ. Not Austin, TX great, but for anywhere else, it's up there. It's cheap and filling for some good rubbed meat!
