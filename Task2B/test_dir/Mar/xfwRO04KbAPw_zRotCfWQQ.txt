Overrated. Have tried 2x, once with the fam and once with a friend from back east. He was unimpressed as it all does taste the same. Bigger does not always mean better as we can attest to when people watching in this town.. . Service was rushed and when we placed the order, it came out not even 5 min later which leads me to believe there may be a few vats in the kitchen which are mix and match. . . First time had eggs benny w fried chix. Unsure what I was thinking w that one but it had that hospital cafeteria tasteless look and taste. Second time had the scramble with bacon and avocado which was of the same same. Perhaps the lunch and dinner is the way to go go here.
Great food, and WOW! Be careful and share a plate of something the portions are huge!
I love breakfast, and I love trying out places that have good reviews for breakfast, but I was extremely disappointed with this place. I think their focus is more on quantity and completely ignores quality. I did not like the food at all, I must say that I was expecting more. The food was bland and flavorless. AND THE COFFEE was super strong, I tried mixing it with half cup of hot water and it was still really strong. I would never recommend this place.
This is my favorite place for brunch!  I have never had a bad meal here.  The wait can be a bit long but it's so worth it.  Not only is the food delicious but the service is amazing.  I sometimes take my daughter who is wheelchair bound with me & the staff is always so accomodating to us & our specific needs.
There bloody marries are on a different level. Worth the trip for just that alone. Anyways there breakfast and lunch is amazing. I love there chicken and asparagus hash. AH-MAZING. Drool. The wait is always awful but definitely worth it.
Ok I really do like this place and their food but today was different. They have large portions which is great unless you order the grilled salmon salad. It's a huge plate with a whole lot of iceberg lettuce and piece of salmon gone in six bites, different than their normal huge plates. Stick with the sage chicken and waffles. They're awesome!
I had the bacon,  avocado,  and cheddar stuffed burger. DELICIOUSNESS! Serving size was very generous. Restaurant was clean and the staff friendly. Will be back.
All I can say is HUGE.  Went with my family that was in town visiting.  I ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  I had never had that before and have always been nervous to try it because I like to have milk when Im eating syrup yet in my mind milk and chicken just didn't go together but I decided to give it a whirl.  Oh my goodness.  It came out and was huge.  I don't even think I ate half and had to wrap it up to take it home.  The chicken was seasoned very well and the waffles were crunchy and fluffy.  AMAZING.  My dad ordered one of the stuffed burgers and loved it.  My grandma and her friend ordered some eggs and sausage and toast and said it was excellent.  I will definitely go back.
Great food & service. Professional & knowledgeable staff. Food was on point!
This place is amazing and theres nothing like it. Yes the price might be not the greatest but the portions are great. I eat a lot so its perfect for someone like myself. The only reason why I am giving it a 4 star is because of the prices. I would recommend everyone to try this place and you might fall in love.
Watermelon drink is TO DIE! Love. Tried their chicken and waffles but I the chicken was pretty bland. Would still recommend this restaurant as the atmosphere and people are very friendly and nice!
The best of the best for breakfast or brunch!  The plates are big enough to share ~ actually platter sized.  The presentation is fantastic and mostly artfully stacked.  My favorite is the salmon filet with eggs and mashed potatoes.  They have great Bloody Marys too!
Only because I love the food here is why I come here all the time and put up with the hit n miss customer service. The host here are horrible several times that we been here we sit waiting and they keep sitting guests that comes in after us and said they thought we have left....mind this waiting area is rt in front of them. Other times another host just points to bar and says you can sit there or do u want dinning in a very unpleasant voice like she is over it.....then throws our menus on the table and says all your menus are here and walks away....we also had a server that dropped our check in the middle of our meal and said "just in case you can't find me".... really????.....Our other experiences here has been fine where we can deal with it....but hopefully they retrain their staff that just doesn't have any customer service personality.....start with the host first cause they are who we see first and if it is a bad experience I will will think the rest of my experience will be as bad.....
Great customer service the food is great here food is served enough for 2 chicken and waffle s.  Erin was the best always with a big smile Thanks Erin
Gotta have the Chicken and waffles with bacon in the center of the waffles, the fried green tomatos are a winner too.
Everything was big and delicious should come here.   Had the BLT and my wife had the Chicken pot pie. Beautiful presentation! Reasonable prices and huge portions. Will definitely come back!
I just dined at the location off of Sahara. Wanted to let you know about the staff and food.. Staff we waited five minutes at an empty hostess stand, empty bar with a bar tender who wasn't serving anyone.. We get seated our waitress (Caucasian, blonde spikes hair) was outstanding.. I didn't know if something was wrong with my taste buds or my meal was prepared incorrectly. . I get home and google pictures of my duck dish and there it was, the chef forgot the cashews and spice. my duck was so bland, I didn't even taste salt, and it was suppose to be spicy. Plus it was over cooked. 3 major issues! What!?!?. . Also at 830 the staff mopped the bar area, started prepping the table for I'm sure tomorrow's breakfast, ketchup, hot sauce and sugar. It blew my mind that they were prepping so early for the next day, I'm sure trying to get out as soon as they close the doors, and they couldn't spend an extra 5 minutes on making my dish right.. . This made me feel invaluable to them and unwelcome. I heard a lot of great things about this place and was shocked they messed up 3 major components of my dish.. . Large portions / share your dish / skip appetizer, you get a huge delicious complimentary biscuit.
I love this place.  When I am hungry and want to grub out I love coming here and getting different dishes.
I haven't had a bad experience here.  I frequent this restaurant every couple months and make sure to bring all of my out of town guests here.  Their food is not only affordable, especially with their HUGE serving sizes, but their service is always fantastic.. . Customer for life here :)
A Sunday morning excursion here meant a 45 minute wait time. Too bad we couldn't get here before everyone slept off the alcohol and partying from the night before...maybe if there was no remnants of leprechaun piss in my own bloodstream.... . Long wait, but the food is worth it. I don't usually order pancakes when I'm out, but blueberry and white chocolate is a seductive combo. My dining companion had the sage fried chicken benedict with a nice chipotle kick to it. Portion sizes are ridiculously huge...the Benedict could have served 3 or 4 people and the pancake extended over two opposite edges of the giant plate. Plan to share or doggie bag! Good food, expertly seasoned, and prices are a value taking into account the amount of food served. Kiwi watermelon lemonade was tangy, refreshing and pretty to look at with the three layers before I swirled them all together. Casual farm ambience with enough stainless steel worked in to not feel cheesy and decent service considering how packed it was. I was elated to learn they have a location back home I can check out after I leave fabulous Las Vegas ^.^
2/15/14. . the wait was  pretty long- about 40 minutes.. my usual go-to, when im out to breakfast, is the eggs benedict. so,i had the Original eggs benedict with bacon. i cant say that it knocked me off my feet. it was definitely different but not necessarily delicious. . . im glad i experienced this spot but i probably wont be going back.
great food
The food is great and I always have left overs for the next day! The place is very busy but the service was still good and never felt like the server forgot about us.
Great strong coffee & some of the best breakfast in town.
I love eating here and trying there interesting combinations.  . . I love mash potatoes on my hamburgers
I went to the location at Palace Station. The food while served in huge serving was slightly cold and not all that appetizing. The Bloody Marys again were huge but overly spicy and the service was impersonal. . For all the hype it definately was not worth the price. Try Blueberry Hill instead or Egg works.
found is amazing #large portions
Loved everything about this place! Great prices! The food was delicious! The services was spectacular! A must visit when in Vegas!
There is only one thing I eat there and I never pick a different item. Why? Because it's my perfect crave. The Chicken & Waffles! It's a huge portion so if you're really hungry then enjoy. It's enough for 2 to share. This is a must try.
WOW unbelieble food, presentation and portions!
So my husband and I remembered seeing this joint on Man v. Food ages ago.  We decided to come here not only because of that fact, but there were also multiple locations around the city and the reviews convinced us that we should try it out.  . . There was no wait for us, but we went around noon on St. Patrick's Day, so it wasn't really that busy.. . It took a while to slog through the menu - there were an awful lot of choices and I didn't know what to select.  From watching MvF (or, really, anything Adam Richman does), we knew that the portions were going to be insane - and the server even warned us ahead of time that it would happen.  So, yeah.  Come here hungry if you don't want a takeout box, because nearly everyone had them.. . I really wanted the chicken and waffles dish that I'd seen, but I KNEW that was going to be too much.  And in light of what I actually ordered, I'm grateful for that decision.. . My husband and I ordered the Tractor Driver special - carby item plus eggs plus potatoes.  I ordered a vanilla waffle, he ordered a Snickers pancake.  (Both items incur a slight upcharge.)  And coffee.  Lots of coffee.. . When it came.... the look of shock on both of our faces.  We'd been warned, all right, but neither of us actually knew what we were bargaining for.  The attached pictures show the look on my husband's face as he hefts up the SIDE of this gargantuan pancake.  I mean, really.  It was hanging off the edge of the plate.  . . My vanilla waffle was not much smaller, either.  It came with a small container of sweet syrup and a fresh strawberry.  Nice touch.. . The food was pretty good, I will say.  I didn't notice any difference between a waffle and a vanilla waffle, though - unless my palate is so jaded that I can't tell.  The coffee was pretty good.  It was all just so MUCH.  Obscenely so, really.  It's a good thing that I decided I wasn't going to count calories on vacation..... . So why only 4 stars instead of 5?  Price was a bit steep, though you do get your money's worth.  And the server was a little on the "cool" side for me.  I don't mind people not hovering (in fact, I prefer it), but she was a little TOO standoffish, which can be just as much a turnoff.  . . The decor (all silvery with a 'metal' theme) was not up my alley, either.  Just very cold and industrial.. . Would we come back?  Probably, if we feel the need to eat everything in the entire state of Nevada.  Otherwise, we'll share a plate.
We used to go to Hash House for breakfast all of the time.  We loved their french toast and gigantic waffle.  However, in the last two months, we have stopped going as the last 3 times we went, the meat and eggs were entirely TOO greasy for some reason and the waffle was doughy (not cooked enough) and my french toast was burned.  It takes an incredibly long time to get food re-done and honestly, I have to evaluate if the value is there as the breakfasts are pricey.  I don't need a ton of food, just good quality of food as they used to have.  I gave them three stars as everyone should try them once, and my hope is they return to quality as then I will gladly return to the restaurant.  Until then, so many other places to have breakfast in Vegas for far less $. We also tried them for dinner to see if there was a difference with the kitchen perhaps but nope, over salted food and my now my bacon and french toast were both burned....twenty minutes later, still chasing the server to check on our food.......dropping another star on this review soon.......
This place has fabulous food and great service. This is a must for anyone visiting Vegas.
Always good food and service..
Hash House A Go Go was great! Thefood was really tasty and the portions were huge. The service was great. I had a breakfast skillet. So good! We went on a Saturday morning around 9. The wait wasn't too bad. 20 minutes, maybe. When we left the waiting area was packed. Go early if you can. Trying to find Hash House from the Quad Parking garage was a bit confusing.
always great and a long time favorite!
THIS PLACE  IS FANTASTIC! Come hungry! The wait was reasonable for a place that EVERYONE is trying to get into. The service was EXCELLECT and told the MANAGER their STAFF were doing a great job! My coffee cup was never empty and my syrup flow was never low as well. GREAT PLACE! WILL GO AGAIN!
The portions are so massive, it's best to share entrees. I has a chicken pot pie & my hubby had waffles with bacon...  nom nom nom!!!
Huge Portions. This is the second time we came here. The first was years ago, around 2008. I'd say the atmosphere and ambiance are the same, but the quality of the food has gone down. I'd still say to go check it out. The staff is friendly, service is excellent, and as I said, the portions are HUGE. Maybe we were there on a bad morning.
Any place that serves orange pineapple juice is a winner in my book. I tried a few of their house hashes and they were all tasty.
I went here with  my friends and it was not worth waiting and hour and a half to eat crappy burnt food. Why do they put Sage and stick it on a biscuit...
Food is good but the portion size is outrageous! Please share! Service is a bit slow and the staff aren't overly friendly but perhaps they had too many pancakes and simply can't digest!
Terrible service!!!! Had to wait 30min to pay check. One of those places that serves big portions of cheap food and since they received a little exposure makes them not care about service and cheap food.
