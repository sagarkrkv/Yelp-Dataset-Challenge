I've stayed at Excalibur quite a few times. If you are going to pay extra to upgrade your room to a contemporary it's great. However, if you are just looking for a basic room (because after all you are just sleeping and showering in it) below basic is what you will get. My bed skirt had  a HUGE stain on it. My mom pointed it out. We even laughed about what kind of activity could possibly cause a stain that huge. And my comforter had a cigarette burn on it. Well not a comforter, but a blanket that would be suited for an animal shelter. Check in is slow, long lines. Rude bell hop that had a major attitude and was short with us. Then he stared at us and wondered why he didn't get a tip. The coupon book is nice, but they have to find a way to get you to patronize their hotel/casino because you won't do it for the rooms. We love the location, the variety of food, the staff. Just beware that if you are looking for bottom of the barrel that is what you will get!!!
"At least it's cheap!" was my tip.. . It's incredibly well priced, so for that, I give it 3 stars.  I didn't stay here, my friend did, and I spent some time at her room.  Seems quiet enough, clean enough, although the decor was very dated and the hotel itself was quite smokey.  If you need something quick and cheap, you might want to consider this.. . If not, go to a nicer hotel!  What are you, crazy?
This place was the coolest thing ever when I was little. The pool with the slides the arcade with all those toys to win! but what happened? This place definitely does the trick when you're on a budget. I went with a couple of friends and we stayed here because it was the cheapest. We figured what are we going to do...just sleep right? no point of going to the better/newer hotels. Although that was our downfall, at least clean up the place. Yes, the beds were made but there were stains on the carpet and there was McDonald's trash in the dresser, the beds were hard. They really need to give this hotel a makeover.
The only reason I am not annoyed at the inability to give ZERO stars is because we did enjoy the soaking tub and the Fun Dungeon. Also we saw a show at NYNY and went over there for shopping and the roller coaster which was convenient.. . First of all the time share people are unacceptably aggravating! Accosting you at every turn.. . I normally stay elsewhere. Its difficult to find rooms with soaking tubs just by going to websites, you have to call from one place to another to find them half the time and even then they are not plentiful (or the rooms are well over a grand for 3 nights). The hotel we normally stay at DOES have them but they were sold out for the weekend (I did book 5 weeks in advance) of that type of room and we wanted that treat, otherwise we probably would have stuck with what we knew.. . We've gone to the Excalibur before on multiple occasions because we like Dick's Last Resort and we've also gone to the Tournament of Kings. So for about 600 dollars we spent 3 nights . . Thankfully we didn't spend a whole heck of a lot of time in our room.. . Only one of my issues is something completely out of the control of the hotel and that would be the noise. We've never stayed in a room facing the strip before and we were on the corner in tower 2 so there was traffic, loud motorcycles, sirens from ambulances and police, as well as screaming from the roller coaster (this stopped around midnight though, thankfully). . (Enjoying the roller coaster and listening to it whenever your in your room for any period of time can become annoying). . Our room was the FARTHEST room from the elevator, so ALL the way across the casino, then all the way back to the VERY end of the hall in tower 2. This may be because the room had a "soaking tub". . Our room was.... a shambles. Here is the description of what our room professes to be (snippets from the actual description on their site). . " Contemporary Superior Room, reign in this beautiful room . Soaking tub and luxurious bathroom featuring granite counter tops. High-speed Internet access.. . Contemporary means updated (doesn't it?) This room had a thin blanket that was not really big enough for a king bed with 2 sleeping in it and a thin duvet (more like a sheet covering it) I shouldn't have to crank up the heat because I was given a beggars blanket. but the cover over the thin blanket seemed to be the newest thing in the room. . . The wallpaper was peeling (badly in some places), the tiles in the bathroom were so chipped it looked like someone spilled dirt all over and then didn't bother to sweep it up, the wallpaper had obvious patches in it and then was painted over (if this room was updated WHY wasn't the wallpaper torn down and the room painted, its SO easy and makes a huge difference), the door stop behind the bathroom door was falling out, the chairs by the table were threadbare, the table itself was gouged and deeply scratched (which was made worse by the fact that it was painted black so every scuff made it look cheap and neglected, and there was also a broken cover plate to the plug receptacle.. . I was so disgusted I took pictures of all of the things that were tangible. . . Other issues I had?. . The Internet being included in your resort fee being only via Ethernet is VERY outdated and misleading, I brought an iPad I couldnt use that Internet. Also the cord didn't even reach the bed, you'd have had to drag a threadbare chair over and sat right next to the dresser where the Ethernet cord was tethered. There was wireless, but it was in the lobby. Who uses Ethernet in a hotel?. . The tiling was crooked in the bathroom, this isn't something easily fixed, just another testament to how shoddy the entire place was.. . The window shade by the tub was broken completely so you couldn't look out that window while in the bath, (this is a simple and cheap fix, just like the cover plate would have been). . The clover tub was OK, but there was a little plastic sign sitting near the tub (not stuck or screwed in or anything) giving instructions on how to use the jacuzzi and what all the knobs meant, but it was a clover TUB not a jacuzzi, there was ONLY hot/cold, not a complaint, but still misleading.. . In the halls there was graffiti on lighting fixtures (I only took a picture of one but we saw several) and huge dark scuffs on the wall paper in the halls.. . Another thing that really bothered me was I've never been bugged by security before in a casino (EVER) and neither has my guy, but there was someone being loud and belligerent with a security guard as we were heading out somewhere and I don't know what it was about but he was drunk and it was unsettling.. . I will NEVER stay here again. We will come back for Dick's Last Resort, because that place is awesome but for the price I paid just for an over-sized tub in our room, it was absolutely not worth it.. . The Valets and Bellmen were very nice.
The Excalibur is an OK hotel, very well located on the Vegas Strip. The problem is everything else. Right as we walked in, we could smell the smell, and it wasn't smoke - it was some cleaning agent. You could tell that they had sprayed something that made the entire place smell like a cheap motel. And the people who were there were - well let's just say that they were people who paid $49. a night, as we did. We're no better than anyone else, but hope you like rowdy 20-somethings out for their first night in Vegas, complete with the footlong beer bongs and paper hats.. . Internet? Sure! We were told, but came to find out that is is wired Ethernet only; NO wireless. Want a cup of coffee after using the gym? Forget it; they required not only the room key which we had, but also, ID. All they had to do was look us up to see that we were in fact registered there AND had our room key. I had a martini in the bar and my wife had a coke. When she asked for a refill on the soda, they said sure - it's another $3.50, despite the fact that I paid for a 2nd martini and was gambling at the bar on the video poker.. . The room was clean, except for the same pervasive cleaning agent smell, but had no night tables, no reading lamps, no mini-bar, and very little furniture. A bed, a TV, a small table, two chairs, and a lamp. I know, for $49. what did I expect? Well, there are thousands of rooms in Vegas with better accommodations and wireless Internet, and places that don't nickle and dime you to death at every turn.. . I doubt that the Excalibur will fold up and close, but they sure won't be seeing us again. And if you stay there, bring your noseplugs and an Ethernet cable.
We stayed at his hotel only because we made a fairly last minute booking and it was the most affordable option for the weekend. This was a mistake.. On arrival the hotel is clearly lacking an adequate cleaning staff or their attention to detail is just horrible. Everything from the outside of the hotel to the casino floor was for lack of better words, disgusting. Glass doors tagged, scratched and covered in finger prints. Gum stuck everywhere. The water feature in front of the hotel was 90% empty and filled with trash and algae. Our room was no winner either. We actually had to get a new room because our first one seemed like the forgot to clean it. Aside from all the cleanliness issues, the hotel no longer feels like a medieval, or castle like atmosphere. Had I not known what the hotel was known for, I would of never guessed it was supposed to be a castle. Its quite a shame.. . We also opted for the buffet they offered....Do yourself a favor and pass on that. If you want to feel like your in an old hometown buffet and eat horrible food....Then go for it. Otherwise go down the strip to damn near ANY other buffet. My fiance tried a number of items from the buffet and finally gave up, she ended up eating watermelon and drinking water. Everything is clearly reheated and none of that was even done well. Every thing we ate was cold in the middle. It was almost comical how consistent this problem was. The eggs felt like I put a sponge in my mouth. Both texture and taste. My biggest failure with the buffet was the "chow mein noodles" (ramen). Even this was not cooked all the way. Hard uncooked noodles were just as prevalent as actual edible noodles. An employee asked me how my meal was and i told him it was utterly disappointing. He smiled and said "good." I don't believe he spoke English. But he was working hard which is less than I can say for the cleaning staff. (if there is one...). . Now for the biggest problem of all. The timeshare salesmen......... Immediately upon entering the hotel (and especially while holding luggage) you WILL be approached by a timeshare salesmen. They will try to rope you in with offers of free or cheap tickets to shows and dinners. The offer works like any other timeshare presentation. They give you something but  only after you go to a presentation to purchase a timeshare in the hotel. The presentation however, is of course in another hotel....So you have to opt for a ride to this other hotel where you will be stuck until they agree to take you back or you just decide to walk. You can decline and go about your day but the problem doesn't stop here. Going to your room? Prepare to be approached by timeshare salesmen. Going to the casino? Timeshare salesmen again. Entering or exiting the hotel? Timeshare salesmen....Going to Dicks last resort? (which btw is this hotels only saving grace and consequently their most heavily promoted attraction) Timeshare salesmen!!!!!! I cant stress this enough....You WILL be approached by them constantly and consistently.. . Don't waste your time with this hotel unless you are for some reason in an outrageous need for a timeshare. And even still, don't buy it from here. If the hotel is any indication of the product they are selling....Your gonna have a bad time.
Pretty much a dump. Not a great location, rooms are small and guaranteed to smell bad. The whole place wreaks of smoke even if you're in the no-smoking section. It smells truly awful, I can't emphasize that enough. . . As I said the rooms are small, the windows don't really open. The beds are far from comfortable, though not painful like some other hotels I've been at. There was a small low quality tv in the room and the bathroom was a pretty tight fit as well. Thankfully I minimized my time spent in the room.. . There may have been a gym somewhere. Excalibur has a pretty confusing layout actually despite seemingly being a square. There's plenty of gambling though and cheap gambling - $5 and $10 tables were pretty frequently available. The downside though is that it's pretty far from the rest of the strip; I much prefer to spend time around Caesars, Bellagio, Cosmo, Aria. And there are cheap casinos there as well (Quad, Harrahs, etc).. . There's just one thing going for Excalibur - it's cheap. I think I was paying between 30-60 per night. Pretty tough to find that price anywhere else on the strip. But you get what you pay for...not much.
Great location with plenty of shopping and restaurants. Big casino with strange 6-5 blackjack payouts. Sadly the rooms and hallways are worn and old. Ate at dick's and bucca and loved them both. Really hated the time share vultures at each entrance. They pretend to work for the hotel and help and then ambush you.
I have stayed here once before and everything was ok, besides our original room wasn't cleaned and looked like ppl were still staying in it, they gave us a new room and our trip was great. HOWEVER this trip was way different, we arrived on Wednesday 3/5 and checked in no problem. Well my fiance went golfing Thursday morning and took a shower before he left, I woke up to the worst smell ever. It smelt like nair and something burning all at once. I thought at first it was maybe the fan or something so I didn't say anything. I took a shower on Wednesday night and to my horror it was the water that smelt like. Thursday we went down and let the staff know, then went out on the strip. Well we got back late and found a letter saying that the problem was fixed by some one. Well of course I tested it, and surprise it was still smelling like death. At this point I'm upset because how has house keeping not noticed this smell. My mother in law walked in on Friday and asked me what that horrid smell was so I told her. Well she was even more upset and concerned about how safe it was to shower. A plumber came on Friday night and said it was the smell of sewage, so im thinking great I was showering in that. He said he just needed to use drain cleaner and everything was fine. Well woke up late sat and had to hurry off to the race track, came back sat to shower and the smell was still there, it actually got worse. I got nauseous everytime a shower was taken due to the smell. I actually was thankful that we had booked a couple of rooms for family, that I ended up showering in another room sun because I just didn't feel clean showering in the sewage smelling water. They never moved us or anything. Stay away from room 27-1-47 or you will smell like sewage the entirety of your vacation.
The Excalibur is a great hotel if you need a cheap place to crash for a simple Vegas trip to enjoy the Strip. It's not as glitzy as some of the more expensive alternatives like the Bellagio, but the rooms are nice enough to crash and the casino is decent. The concierge is helpful and will do everything in their power to help you with transportation, show tickets, etc. Shoutout to Nicole who was especially helpful in particular.. . The tables are reasonably cheap and the location at the south end of the Strip is somewhat convenient, because you can still get to other reasonably-priced casinos/restaurants in the nearby NYNY, Mandalay Bay and Luxor without having to pay the higher costs for rooms in those hotels. There's elevated walkways to get you across the streets and a tram to get you between a few of the nearby hotels, and easy access to the LV Monorail. The check-in line seems to always be about 150 people long (not exaggerating), but they had all hands on deck and we were through the line in about 10 minutes tops.. . There's a McDonalds, Cinnabon, Popeyes and numerous cheap options downstairs in the food court so that you don't always have to go out and pay for expensive Vegas food. Yes, the McDonalds honors the Dollar Menu even in the casino.. . I feel the need to address some of the other reviewer's complaints to give credit where it's due:. - No, there is no Wi-Fi. But, at least in our room in Tower 1, it came with a retractable Ethernet cable, so hooking up was no problem.. - The hotel isn't excessively smoky unless you're REALLY offended by smoke. But hey, it's Vegas. Sin City. Everyone has their vices here, and if you don't like smoke, I don't know what casinos you expect to visit where it's not allowed.. - Our room was nothing to write home about, but it wasn't dirty or smelly. It was a relatively nice, basic room and the beds were plenty comfy - about what you'd get at a Holiday Inn Express. It had a very large TV and while the decor is a bit outdated, it's a place to sleep and it's cheap. Deal with it.. . If you're expecting to stay at a fancy-schmancy resort in Vegas with modern art and fountains everywhere, then this isn't for you. But if you just need a bed to sleep on with a decent casino and several cheap restaurants right downstairs, easy access to go see all the glitzy stuff on the Strip, without being in a sketchy motel off the Strip, then the Excalibur is perfect. I'll definitely stay here again.
I don't understand all the negative reviews. I was just here for 3 nights and we had a wonderful time! We stayed in Tower 1, which didn't have any special views of the strip but we didn't care about that. We were in Vegas for Vegas..not to be in the room the entire time. We were only in the room to sleep and needed a place to crash at the end of our long Vegas days of walking the strip. If you have the same needs, Excalibur is the place for you. The rates are cheaper and the rooms are comfortable...the beds were very nice after a long day of walking around the strip. Housekeeping was also very helpful in our trip as we needed them a few times to get items for us that we forgot and they had them at our room within minutes! The only downside is the location on the strip as it is on the South end...so if you want to go anywhere, it is a pretty good walk...but I actually appreciated that bc it forced me to get some much needed exercise after all the eating I did. They also have an $18 resort fee which includes internet and use of their fitness center if you need more exercise. I'll definitely be back as this was a great hotel for the price. It was much nicer than the Quad down the way, which is currently offering rates double what Excalibur is offering.
Spend the extra money to stay in a hotel rather then a place that smells horrible from the second you walk in the door. There is no good amenities, rom service is only open breakfast and lunch, to be honest I really have nothing good to say about the place, this is my first time staying here, but I come to Vegas at least once a month for the last 5 years and haven't had a worse experience. PS, there is no wifi
I have been staying at Excalibur for the last 15 years (ever since I turned 21). I have stayed there maybe 10-15 times. I just took my kids and wife there for the first time. It was also my first time being back there in about 3-4 years. To put it nicely, the place has turned into a dump! from the check in to the check out, it was one nightmare after another. Not only they didn't have a room for us when we arrived, once we finally did get the room, it was filthy!  I was disgusted to get into the shower even. To make a long story short, I will never ever go there or recommend it to anyone ever again. They charge you one rate, then once you get there, their salespeople try up selling the crap out of the rooms. $5 bucks extra, if you want a room, $5 bucks extra if you want a remodeled room,$10 extra if you want a flat screen TV. It is insane!I know it's not the Bellagio, but it had never been like this.
This is one of the more affordable hotels on the strip. You get what you pay for though, so I did not have high expectations.  As expected, I experienced quite a few annoyances. Excalibur seemed to have trouble covering up the smell of smoke.  Other hotels do an okay job at it. My key card stopped working part way through my stay. I heard loud noises outside my window at night, and no, not drunk people. It sounded as if a flag was whipping in the wind, and there was a banging echo sound (like someone banging on a heater/register) and a sound of constant glass breaking.  It was a strange combination of sounds.Lastly, no w-ifi in the room.  I was there 5 days so I ending up using quite a bit of my data :/. . Even with all the unpleasantries,  I am still happy with my stay and the price I paid.
Our party of 4 adults stayed at this hotel for 4 nights arriving on 3/6/2014. We got some decent discount deal online when reserving 2 rooms (with 2 Queen size beds each) almost 2 months in advance.  Average price of $147/night per room excluding taxes and resort fee.. Check-in process was very smooth. The hotel receptionist was very kind in getting us two rooms in Tower 2 near the elevators on the 27th floor, since one of our family members is semi-handicapped. The rooms were clean and roomy, although somewhat dated. Sound insulation is rather poor, we could easily hear conversations in the adjacent rooms. There was no small fridge or coffee maker in the room, but there is hair dryer, ironing board and a plasma TV set in the room.. The hotel offers all the essential amenities, including few stores and a Food Court on the second level from the lobby area. There are couple of Starbucks inside the hotel (one by the casino) and few other restaurants that we did not get to try. There is access to a free tram that runs from the Excalibur Hotel to the Mandalay Bay Hotel, making a stop at the Luxor. The Hotel also has a walkway to the New York New York Hotel next door. We found the location of our hotel actually quite convenient (close to the airport) despite of the fact that it is not right in the heart of the Strip, but it's still walking distance to several hotels nearby (MGM, New York New York, Luxor, Montecarlo, Mandala Bay, etc.).. The Excalibur looks a bit old inside, some carpets near and inside the elevators could be better cleaned. But overall it is a very good hotel if you are planning tovisit Las Vegas and don't plan to spend much time inside the room. Once you visit other hotels like Bellagio, Mandala Bay, Winn, or Aria, the Excalibur will look and feel more run-down. It is still a practical and convenient hotel to stay if you get a good discount rate.
I been coming to this establishment for last 20 + years and have never experienced such poor customer service as I did today March 21, 2014 it took half an hour to get my alcohol beverages from an Asian employee I spoke to the bar beverage manager Cortney Norris which was very nice and polite but if you guys keep on hiring these kind of employees you will lose great paying customer at your establishment.I suggest you talk to that Asian person who took half an hour to take my order which was never delivered.. . Beware of Asians as your servers as they will not get your drinks to you in a timely matter!!. . PS you lost a great paying customer that pays your bills!!. . Avoid playing slots at this hotel!!
always fun.. my cousins always stay here and its nothing but good times!
This place is nasty. It received 4 stars by some people?!?! No way!  Those people probably live in a barn. The rooms are dated. The rooms have popcorn ceiling, cheesy pictures on the wall, and funky carpet. I didn't want to take my shoes off. When I first came in the room I smelled a strong odor of smoke. Then I realized it was my hair that absorbed the smoke from just 15 minutes of being in the casino- the time it took to walk in and check in at the desk. The casino floor is so smokey. There are no good restaurants here. See my Dicks review.  There is  NO Wifi! Circus Circus is better. At least they have a steak house that is decent. Circus circus seems cleaner.. We stayed here because everything was booked for march madness. We paid $150. A night. We should have rented Palms Place for $200 a night. . OH! And the bedding...... Sheets were clean, but the blankets were cheap like worn out dorm or summer camp blankets. . The clientele in the casino were very creepy. They looked like off duty renaissance fair workers.
We just stayed in this hotel for three nights during the first weekend of March Madness this year. Overall, we had a pretty good experience.. . Here's my take: . . Pros: . . *Good price for busy weekend. I originally booked this hotel for close to $700 for three nights due to March Madness, but Excalibur offers a great price match deal if you book through their website. (I think Luxor might offer the same deal). I booked the hotel through their site and then found a cheaper advertised price on Otel.com. I sent in a claim form (kind of a pain of a process, but worth it) and Excalibur beat Otel's price and offered me 10 percent off as well for finding the better deal. I ended up getting the hotel for about $107 a night before resort fees and tax. Good deal, especially for such a busy weekend. They were advertising upwards of $250 a night for Friday and Saturday. Note: Make sure you read all the rules of the price match before you book and that you give yourself enough time to cancel if Excalibur denies your claim. You can cancel within 48 hours for a full refund. . . *Good location. This hotel is close to lots of dining and fun. It's connected to Luxor and not far from Mandalay Bay and a host of other hotels. It makes for a good home base. . . *Clean and spacious room. Ours was recently renovated. . Cons:. . *Weird smell. I can only imagine what goes on in some of these casino hotel rooms. Our room had a weird mustard smell that we couldn't seem to get rid of. . . *Hard beds. Definitely not the most comfortable around.. . *No conditioner. This is for the ladies. I had to go buy some. I hate when hotels give you the 'conditioning shampoo'. That stuff sucks. I think if I'm paying more than $100 a night, the hotel should provide both shampoo and conditioner. . . *The fees. This is not a specific issue with Excalibur because all Vegas hotels now charge a 'resort fee'. This is, of course, just another way of tacking an additional $15-25 onto your bill daily.  All the hotels do it so they can get away with it. So, even though we got the hotel for $107 a night, we paid $420 total with the fees and taxes. That's an additional $100 tacked onto the trip.  Ridiculous. Again, you'll find this with most hotels so just consider that when booking so you're not surprised at check-in. It bugs me that the hotel can advertise one rate, and keep those fees hidden in small print because it really is a significant boost in price. Just be aware that those fees do exist and the tax is super high.
Came here to redeem my 1 night free pass at this hotel from myvegas on Tuesday, March 25th to Wednesday, March 26th. There was no problem with baggage check in and hotel check in.. . My friends and I had a 2 queen bedroom and it was a pretty decent bathroom (for us 4 girls to get ready). It wasn't the biggest and best room, but HEY IT WAS FREE!
