Eating at Lotus of Siam is the quintessential Las Vegas dining experience. The buffets and fine dining on the strip are great, but the Thai food here is what I must eat every time I visit.. . Don't order the typical Pad Thai or Pineapple Fried Rice which can be found at any Thai restaurant. People come here for the exotic Northern Thai dishes instead.. . My all time favorite is the Crispy Duck with Penang Sauce. I actually don't like duck, not even what I've had in France or Beijing, which they're known for, but the duck here so good I've made an exception. It's crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. A rare and winning combination in my book. . . As other reviews have noted, Lotus of Siam truly is the best Thai food in America. There's a reason why people still cab it here even though it's located in a ghetto plaza far off the strip. It's worth the trip.
Please take the time to peel yourself away from the buffet, away from the strip, and come to Lotus of Siam. This will now be a must-eat for me when I come to Vegas. Believe the hype, it is incredible here.. . Skip the stuff that sounds familiar; pad Thai, drunken noodles, etc. and go straight to the Northern Thai section of the menu. We ordered the Khao Soi which had egg noodles in a coconut cream curry base, beef, and pickled veggies. I wanted to dive into that broth it was so good and the noodles were the perfect texture. We also got the Northern Larb which was surprisingly light and spicy, lots of lime and pork. Lastly, we got Kang Ka Noon, the jackfruit curry. It was a nice balance to the other stuff we got, kind of a sweet-hot-sour flavor thing going on. It just sounded weird to us, so we had to try it. . . I highly recommend making a reservation, we would've been so hangry if we didn't do so. The wait was pretty long for those who walked in. The menu is so reasonably priced but tastes far more expensive. I'm not sure if I can eat Thai food anywhere else now!
WOW... best thai food I've ever had, this place is probably what I'll miss most about Vegas when I home to OC. . . From the outside I assumed the restaurant would be a small hole in the wall but when you go inside, to the right of the small dining room is a large dining room (which makes this place a big hole in the wall I suppose) . The decor is minimal, the furniture was kinda old and basic.  . . The food? AAAAAHHHHMAAAZEBALLS! Everything had SO much flavor. Since I came in a party of 3 we were not able to have much of a variety but we ordered 4 dishes. Crying tiger, garlic prawns, crispy duck panang and seafood padthai (off menu item). . . Everything was bomb.com but the duck curry stood out to me most. The meat was crispy & sauce was so flavorful. Fried garlic prawns was very garlicy and prawns tasted fresh.. . Service was nice & friendly. Definitely coming here EVERYTIME I'm in town!
The menu had so many delicious dishes to choose from. Seemed like there was a 100 different dishes and I love when restaurants offer a great variety. After trying to narrow down what to order, I said fuck it ! Let's order everything.  The steak tartar was almost perfect. Just a touch of sweetness and lime would've really rounded out the flavors but maybe that's not a true northern Thai steak tartar. Also had the Thai prawn sashimi, Panang short ribs koa soi, grilled steak dish , golden prawns, soft shell crab wide rice stir fry noodle dish, Tom yum soup ( soup was just okay) . Everything was pretty flavorful . I came on a Monday around 1:30 and the wait was not very long at all. I will def be back the next time I'm in town. Tried so hard to take a pic of the food but my mouth got to it all first oops
Best Thai food anywhere. Pad see ew is incredible. So is the fried rice. If you're unsure whether or not to believe all the hype you hear around this restaurant, you shouldn't. It's even BETTER than what you here :) but be prepared to wait awhile and don't bother calling, their phone will be off the hook.
If you like it hot, you gotta get your butt over to Lotus of Siam :). . The food is amazing. Hands down the best Thai food I have ever had, even compared to LA Thai town! . . Must tries:. + Crispy Duck over egg noodles - This duck is sooooo flavorful, the curry sauce is divine with the perfect amt of spicy and savory. And the duck is actually crispy! I will definitely be back to order this dish again. . + Sea Bass Drunken noodles - So the noodles portion of this was only OK....but the Sea Bass?!?!!? AMAZING. Next time I might order Sea Bass over papaya salad.. + Spicy Squid Salad - LOVED THIS. It was very very spicy, but the seafood was incredibly fresh and the kick of lime was perfectly refreshing. . . Definitely order either the coconut ice cream or a thai tea just to cut some of that spice.... . Yes, if you don't get a reservation, the wait is atrocious. We waited 1 hr to get seated. And we called in ahead of time. But they have a great system where you can literally check your spot in line from your phone and they will text/call you when your table is available. . . Also, expect to spend more $$ than you'd normally spend at a Thai restaurant. We ordered the 3 dishes above plus a sausage dish, plus tea, and spent $100....for 3 ppl....that's kinda pricey!. . Tips: the parking lot is kinda creepy....make sure to lock the car!
We ordered and shared several dishes including roasted duck curry and the crispy rice app. It was all delicious.
Crispy Duck Panang Curry. Garlic Prawns. . . If you want the best Thai food in Vegas or anywhere within 100s of miles, go here. . . Good God it was so delicious and you would never expect it from the looks of the outside. Located in a shipping center off the strip near the older part of town, you expect a hole-in-the-wall and that's what you get walking in. What you don't know is they expanded to the space next to where they originally opened up and it looks like a Michelin Star restaurant. Service was comparable to a Ruth's Chris or any topend steakhouse. Always catering to your needs although very busy. Huge wine cellar in plain site and all the James Beard and Zagat awards on the wall. . . The food. The food though!!! Don't make the mistake of ordering too much at once. Family style and the steamed white rice is endless. Hot pot Tom Kha Kai to start with medium spice. Super delicious, sour, spicy and the best way to start. Dishes came out shortly after. We also ordered the soft shell crab drunken noodles. The dish was super good but I want to focus on the first two I mentioned. Garlic Prawns. Came with the shells which were also fried. Best. Prawns. Ever. So good. But the true star: crispy duck Panang. Duck came in a lake of curry and still remained crispy. It was so good over rice and we ended up ordering another. . . Go here. Don't even hesitate. Go. You won't regret it. If you can find a better Thai place in the area, I challenge you to say that LoS isn't better. I CHALLENGE YOU! Aite?!?And bring your friends with you cause you might get embarrassed.
Yes, it is located in a shopping strip in an older part of town, but do not hesitate to go. The server was so kind and gracious, the curry was some of the best I have ever tasted, and the value was unbelievable.  Even if you think you don't like Thai, you're going to love this place.
Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had. Great service. Everyone is so nice. Warning...the spice is serious Thai spice. So be careful I almost burned my tongue off. Get the Garlic Prawns...you won't regret it. The best thing to do is to anything you wouldn't normally get at your local Thai place. Forget Pad Thai, Tom Yum or Satay. Go for the serious authentic Thai and you'll love it. I have to eat here everytime I come to Vegas.
We were recommended this restaurant by a colleague who had heard about this restaurant that specializes in Northern Thai Cuisine. If you are visiting Vegas, invest in the cab ride out to Lotus of Siam because it is worth it! They have many dishes that you would not find at any other Thai restaurant. Unfortunately, since there were only two of us, we were only able to partake of three dishes. One was the thai sausage (they have 2, we got the one in the back part of the menu). It was spiced unlike any other sausage we'd ever had and was very tasty. We ordered pork belly and chinese brocoli (gai lan) in oyster sauce. It was a simple dish made with very fresh ingredients. The last dish we tried was drunken noodle soft shelled crab. This dish was just very tasty. I had been concerned that the medium spicy sauce we had specified would overwhelm the crab, but it just complimented the crab perfectly. The service was terrific, relaxed, informative, and attentive. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice. It was full, but it did not feel rushed. I take off one star because of the decor. Once inside, I felt like I was in an Italian restaurant with a huge wine room. That said, I would come back again and again to work my way through their menu.
What's wrong with getting the flu in a James Beard rated restaurant? Ruining the meal for the table sitting next to you. Guys, I am so sorry. Let this be a lesson to ALWAYS GET YOUR FLU SHOT. I've been here many times and the food is awesome. Though nothing compares to the level of service of the nicest hostess tending to you when you suddenly develop symptoms in the middle of the dining room. I am so sorry. Lotus of Siam remains, in my opinion, the best Thai in the country.
Lotus of Siam is hands down the best thai restaurant in Las Vegas. This is the go to restaurant when I have friends visiting. The tofu rad na and fried snapper is my favorite. I highly recommend making reservations in advance because if not you're looking at a 30/45 minute wait.
Worth the wait!. Came here because of my foodie friend's string recommendation on a  Friday night.  Arrived about 15 minutes before Lotus of Siam's 5:30 PM opening time.  Got our party of 4 seated right away.  So many delicious choices.  The waiter was helpful in making our selections.  Thescallops, shrimp, and satay were absolutely delicious.  The Yelp reviews were also helpful.  Definitely coming back - this place is less than 5 miles off the strip.  Easy can ride.
Hands down the best Thai Food Experience of my life! This is a must visit for any Vegas Trip. Wine list is extremely deep, menu has too many options... All of which were outstanding! Do not pass this up.
Thai food heaven.  . . I came here on a Thursday night around 8pm with no reservations (stupid me), but for 2, we only waited 30 minutes,  which isn't bad at all.  There were many people getting out of cabs and people were walking so fast into Lotus,  like a competition.  . . Now onto the food:. I heard so many great things about this place and wanted to keep my expectations low,  just so I don't hype myself out.  But.. the food was to die for. The crispy duck with penang sauce was really good: the outer crispiness with the tenderness of the duck.. . I got a curry dish,  and it was perfectly seasoned. I used it as dipping sauce as well as for other items besides rice. . . The sea bass over drunken noodles was also very tasty. . . I wish they had this in los angeles, going to vegas for Thai food is too much of a commute!
Located in a strip mall that is very easy to pass over because its so sketchy looking, Lotus of Siam is a very pleasant surprise within. . . They have many plates that would appeal to all types, from the adventurous eater to the safe nibbler. Most dishes are definite winners, but word to wise, don't underestimate the spice level. Our table definitely got a swift kick to the mouth with the papaya salad. But our other starters were pretty delicious in my opinion. The deep fried shrimp is what they are known for. The shrimp is succulent and juicy, but I wasn't really a fan of the pieces that were just deep fried pieces of shrimp shell. We also tried the crispy rice. 75% of our table weren't fans, but I thought it was definitely bold on flavor. It was different and I have to admit, I actually enjoyed it and was happy to have not ordered run of the mill chicken wings.. . For our entrees, we tried a variety of Thai fusion and authentic Thai. The garlic pepper scallops were very delicious. The scallops had a nice crust, but were also buttery and smooth. But my piece had a little grit to it, so I'm hoping it was pepper and not sand. The sauce was also an excellent topper for rice. Next up was the mint leaf duck which I found  equally tasty. Again, it was bold on the flavor and was not a winner at the table....but I liked it. The duck was a little gamey, but was balanced nicely by the refreshing mint and sweet peppers. Lastly, we tried the massaman curry which can be compared to a red curry with a kick to it - one that kind of reminded me of the flavor of Tom Yum soup.  . . They have a great collection of wine to pair with their meal as well.. . All in all an interesting experience.
When we have visitors, they always want to go here because for them it is a real treat! I don't disagree. The food is great! We are always happy to make this the spot to meet and visit!. . Do I think it is the best Thai in the city, I have to be honest. No, I don't.. . But they have some great dishes! Crispy Duck! YES!. The scallops are amazing! Noodle dishes are pretty great as well.. . I know everyone is crazy about the Garlic Prawns. Our order was 25% shrimp and 75% fried shrimp shells. Which our waiter assured us were edible and delicious. Not a fan of them. Sorry. . . The service has always been A+ since we have been going. . Words of wisdom- MAKE A RESERVATION!! The wait can be a hour+. . No matter how you look, always fun to bring people to a place that has been on so many TV Shows, and frequented by both local and world celebs!
If you were to type ' Las Vegas Thai Restaurant' , in a search engine, there is a reason why Lotus of Siam is probably going to be the 1st thai restaurant you'll see. Although I think there are a few thai restaurants in town that are better, there is no denying that the menu top to bottom, is impressive, which is why Im giving them 5 stars vs 4. Location sucks, but its very close to the strip, which makes it worth the visit. You cant go wrong choosing this place, if your indecisive on choosing a specific thai restaurant. Their Pepper Garlic Chicken is the best thai dish in the city PERIOD. Id also recommend their chili mint chicken. Soups are above average! The last good thing I have to say is if you order SPICY, you get SPICY, unlike other thai spots in town.
I have heard great things about Lotus... Came to Vegas with my BFF and met her friend and former client. Decor was pretty bad - bright lights and in a strip mall but had a great table and really delicious food. . . They came by the table right away and took our drink order which we really appreciated. Had to wait a little bit to order but ended up with a really delicious meal. We started with chicken satay and ended up ordering a second. We had basil chicken medium heat which was a perfect spice level. Overall really solid meal.
I was not thrilled. A friend wanted to go cause she was sick and wanted spicy soup to open up all her senses and I was so annoyed it was awful!  We were only guest in restaurant and another gentlemen came with a baby in a baby car seat and they sat him on us...like pretty much sat right on us...dude the whole place is full I mean seat guests around we even joked with the man how we felt we were having family dinner with him!!!
Apparently this is a lot of our visitors "go-to spot"! And I get the hype. Appreciate the hype. And respect the hype. We always have a great time. We always enjoy the food and the experience. However, I will be clear. To me, this is a great institution and a great food experience. Yet, this is not the best or my FAVORITE Thai restaurant in this city. Yes, every dish is AWESOME! I LOVE their pork belly. I love their fried rices, yes plural.  Their scallops. Noodle dishes are good. . Reservations are required in my book, if not, you could be stuck waiting for an hour or so. It's a GREAT place to take visitors. It's a great place to go because there are so many great write ups about this place. However, as a local, this will not be my personal go-to spot.
Crying shrimp! Roast duck curry! Fried Banana ice cream. The #1 Thai restaurant in America has lived up to its ranking!. Excellent service, quick and thoughtful.
Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had. One drawback is the wait times. But the quality of the food is top notch and worth the wait. Extensive wine list for excellent pairing with your meal. Go-to's have been the Pad Thai and the Roasted Duck Curry. Go here! Trust the fat kid
Have been here a few times and all three (3) visits were a let-down. The food is marginal as I have found much better Thai food in other locations in town. Marnee Thai was better back in the day, and the Thai Noodle House and Archie's are much better. Additionally, the service here has lacked a great deal upon every visit. "Busy" does not necessarily translate into "quality". Would never return.
Amazing food!!! If you're in vegas this is a must. Best thai food in the Western Hemisphere! Be sure to make reservations in advance!!! If you like spicy #35 spicy shrimp salad is SPICY!!! Loved the catfish cakes, and they had a real yummy coconut chicken soup. The roasted duck curry is amazing. I ordered my meal from the back northern menu. Letter G a pork style stew. Don't be afraid of the congealed pork blood. This was amazing. Wish I lived closer. If I'm back in vegas I'll be back to eat at this joint! This is not a place to be missed!
We did not have a single bad dish. The food is excellent. Don't forget to order from the Northern Menu. The larb is good, the chilean sea bass is delicately prepared. The Garlic shrimp is awesome! The seafood drunkin noodles is perfectly cooked without being too greasy like many other spots.. . The wine pour is very poor. So that is my only complaint
I would rate this place a 3.5.. . We originally went to eat at palace station oyster bar but the wait was 1.5 hours long so we headed to this place. They open at 530 and we arrived at 5:10 and there were several ppl in the parking lot already. We lined up like there was a Black Friday sale.  At 530 they opened doors and took ppl with reservations 1st. We were seated fast and received great service. . . We went with yelp recs and got crispy duck in panang curry. It was amazing with perfect 8 spicy although very expensive.  We also ordered the soft shell crab with Drunken noodles which was pretty good but it was a small portion and expensive. Chicken wings weren't anything special. Garlic prawns were delish but again def expensive. Portions were small so we had to order 2 more items. Got the beef jerky which I personally didn't enjoy. I'm a sausage fiend so we got the sai oua which I felt was a little dry and missing something. . . Overall, I wouldn't wait for 2 hours for this place. Everyone raves about it and I agree the food is mostly delicious but the portions are way too small for the price.  Our bill was $113 before tip between 3 of us.  I'm going back to my fav thai nakorn in garden grove, ca.
