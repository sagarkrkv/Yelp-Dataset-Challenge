I wish I could have given 0 stars, got through told them I was army, a vet, told me to get out, obviously not vet friendly... Literally
Went here over 4th of July weekend to see Gareth Emery and he was amazing! The club though... eh - oddly shaped and somewhat small in my opinion.  I expected it to be a bit bigger I guess? but the music overshadows all of that.  The outside area was nice where you can get a drink and catch some air, but definitely crowded since they closed off the pool area at night. . . The main stage was great with the beautiful lights and platforms where dancers would come out in their elaborate costumes every now and then.  They had this awesome blast of cool air every now and then to cool you down while dancing and of course, confetti raining down every half hour.  Who doesn't love that? We were pretty close up front and got a great view and danced all night, which was awesome... but oh my goodness did it get sweaty in that little dance pit.  . . It wouldn't be my first choice for night, but I'd come back for the day club since the pool area looked beautiful!
Saw Kaskade here during Summer Lovin 2014. Great time! Had no issues getting right up to the front. Marquee can definitely get overcrowded so get there early and load up on the drinks.
I booked a table for 8-10 via Andrew from the Jack Colton website for Friday 11/14.  DJ Carnage was on that night and the table min was quoted at $2000 for main room out rim.  This was not my first time at Marquee but first time getting a table there.  I met Andrew at 10pm and was ushered straight in.  I met our host Bryan who walked up to our table.  It was on the outer rim kind of near the bathroom.  I thought it was ok for the price and would fit our group comfortably.  I met our server (Kenna) who took my order.  She tried to push the bigger bottle packages but I stuck with the minimum needed to reach our table min.  Then I left and gambled til about 11:30.  I brought our group back in and was ushered straight to our table.  I was pissed to find about 15 dudes in our area.  Bryan explained that we only had 1/2 the area.  I met Scott our security and he did his best to try to keep the 15 dudes on their side.  But I could tell that this was not going to work out...So I flagged Bryan and asked to be moved to the next section.  AFter about 15 mins, he got the ok and we were quickly escorted to the new table.  Kenna followed us as did Scott.  Everything was good from that point on.  . My thoughts on the club...It is a decent layout.  IT got pretty damn crowded and the dance floor was def not an option.  The bathrooms were a tad far, but was not crowded.  Service was good and fast.  Music was EDM and was good if you are into that.  The crowd wasdecent and probably had an avg age of 25-40y/o.  Good mix of both sexes.  . We were staying in Cosmo so it was nice to just walk down and then back up from the club.
If I have to go here, I will, but it's not my first choice as far as Vegas clubs. We were with a group of bachelorettes and it still took forever to get in because the line was so disorganized. The music was okay, the sound system in the outdoor dance floor wasn't ideal. And after dancing 3 hours and being wasted, who decided we needed to walk down 3 flights of stairs??..
We were recently in Vegas for the week and came here twice, on Monday and on Saturday.  Awesome club with some sick EDM music and a very nice/attractive/upscale crowd -- everyone here dresses to impress.  I would not recommend coming here on a weekend if you're looking to dance as the dance floor is not very big and you will be pushed around.  If you're into that kind of thing, that will work out well for you, otherwise, come out on Monday where it was still awesome and you won't get pushed over on the dance floor.. . They have an outdoor area as well so you can go out there to cool off and catch your breath from dancing.  They even had a free photobooth and we actually got some really good photos of my wife and I.  The bouncers here were really professional and helped us get in and out of the club with ease.
The first time I came here was horrible, and it was such a bad experience that I never wanted to come back. Left that night and went to Moon at the Palms and surprisingly had way more fun. I eventually decided to come back and was surprised that Marquee wasn't bad at all. In my opinion, I think what made it bad for me was the hip hop room. But if you stay on the main dance floor, or hang out outside it's actually pretty fun. The layout is a little bit weird, and the dance floor is kind of small, but the lasers are on point and throws a pretty cool light show :). The only downside to this place is that I always get creeped on often here. I know there are creepers at every club or bar, but for some reason, Marquee really knows how to draw in a lot of them. . . All in all, if i want to have a good time and a drama-free night, I'll come here. Def can't go wrong with Marquee.
This club makes all other clubs in New York feel like a basement party. Seriously I've been to two other Marquee night clubs and this by far has exceeded all my expectations. The music was phenomenal and the men were dressed like gentlemen. Oh by the way, I went on a Monday night and it was long line before 11pm. If this isn't an indicator on how hot this club is, then I don't know what is. The only negative is the layout. As a woman who wears 4 inch heels, walking up and down ramps/stairs is not the move. I would recommend you bring a pair of cheap flats.
I really wanted to like this venue - it's in such a beautiful, chic hotel and they always get such amazing, well known DJs - but it is just not the best night club in Vegas by far.  The dance floor is ssssooooo small.  Every time I have been there, they have bouncers closing off the dance floor because it is at capacity......ummmm, if I am going to a nightclub to see one of my favourite DJs spin, I am gonna want to be on that dance floor shaking my booty!  That is unacceptable in my opinion for a nightclub.  The layout is also kinda strange.  It is very small inside, and then there is a large outdoor portion with pools and cabanas.  It is fine during the summer, but during the winter, when there is no room inside and only outside standing/bar space available, it is just too cold.  . . Also, at one point I was outside, and the bouncer roped off the entrance to get back in to the club.  My group of friends was in eyesight, but out of ear shot, and he would not let me in, nor get their attention for me.  He said I had to walk all the way around, through throngs of drunk people in an unfamiliar environment.  I let him know that my group of friends was nearby and that I didn't want to get separated from them since I did not have a phone or money, and he wouldn't budge.  As a young girl in Vegas, I don't want to be wandering around alone in a crowded venue separated from my party....I would think the safety of their patrons should be more of a priority.
Came here over the weekend for a bachelor party for one of my good friends.  Pretty nice scene from the people, decor, music, and vibe for the most part!  Wish the dance floor would be a lot a bigger (probably could hold about 100-125 people it seems) to try listen to the DJs and entertainment there.  The crowd came out with their A+ game with their attire.  There's a free photobooth just outside of the nightclub where you can feel like a "Hollywood" star with advertised background and such.  Dancers were terrific popping confetti and glow sticks into the crowd.  Probably the best part was the pool....just a work of art! . . I would probably come here again over places like Hakkasan and such where you can have a lot of fun and can breathe haha!
Beautiful venue inside and outside.. EDM music inside. Hip Hop outside.. . We came here over the weekend for Cosmic Gate. It was a great performance. . . We just hated the fact that it was extremely crowded in the dance floor.. Of course, we expect that all Vegas clubs are more directed towards bottle service, therefore, the VIP tables took up most of the space. Its just so unfortunate that the dance floor is so tiny and compacted with people who are inconsiderate of personal space. So beware, you will be bumped and possibly hit in the head or get your foot stepped on. . . At least the bars aren't over crowded and it's a lot easier to buy a drink than it is at any clubs in San Diego.. . The outdoor part of the club outside is beautiful. Big open skies, tons of space to walk around. Plentiful of tables and pools. But it was also lame that the DJ played all the most basic hip hop songs you hear at every other regular club. They need more originality for the most part. . . Overall, this place is OK. I would probably come back and check out their dayclub one day.
Bad experience. Different treatment for different people. Inconsistent rules. Should verify policies with hotel so guests have correct expectations. Took our business elsewhere. . Note to management: Looks can be deceiving.
