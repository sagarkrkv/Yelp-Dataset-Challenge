Absolutely love this place!! We been here about 3 times and is simply royal treatment and amazing food. Yes is pricey but the overall experience was top notch. Our party was about 10+ and again no complaints it was just perfect.
They say you should be very careful of pick pocket thieves in Spain but never did I realize I could be safer in Spain than I was at Carnevino in Las Vegas. The staff puts words in your mouth and adds on services that you did not ask for and up charges anything and everything they can in hopes that you are a dumb consumer and will not realize what hit you. Then once you get the bill with an automatic gratuity because we had a group of 40 people the waiter tells you that the $1,800 tip is not shared with you tables wait staff and begs you to add an additional gratuity for them.. . Soeverything is overpriced, they think they heard you ask for $200 bottles of wine when you didn't, they charge you $20 per head without telling you to have a waiter walk around with a truffle shaver and I could go on. You should really stay as far away from this restaurant as you can. Deliberately unethical.
Yes, everything you've read about this place is true. It is fantastically great and worth every dollar. Be prepared to spend about three to four hours here, as it will not only be your dinner, but also the highlight of your evening. Expensive, yes, but well well well worth it. Wear your fancy eating pants and have a great ride!
Best Aged-Steak in Vegas!. . The only down note was the rock music playing.  It didn't fit with that type of fine-dining restaurant.. . My wife had the filet mignon.  They brought out two (one for each of us) by mistake.  When I told the waiter the correction he told me to enjoy the filet and that he would bring me my aged steak shortly. . . So...I had the turf-and-turf and it was sensational!
I came here with my cousin for her birthday, and we both wanted to indulge on some good Italian. And that we did.. . The beef cheek ravioli (which was an app on special) was one of the best things I've ever had....if you're lucky enough to go when this dish is available, make sure you get the balsamic drizzle on it....it makes a huge difference, and WOW it's tasty!!!. . We also had the veal Marsala and roasted eggplant which had a nice amount of mozza cheese and a delish tomato sauce. We shared a bottle of Amarone which perfectly complimented our meal. That reminds me...the wine list is like Christmas for Italian wine lovers.. . The service was great too - I put a note on Opentable about her b-day and they kept it a surprise which I appreciated.. . It was a pricey meal but worth the splurge. I will definitely come back next time I'm in town and pray they have that ravioli special!!!
Ive been to many steakhouses in LV, the steak here might have been the worst. Over cooked, extremely charred. Calamari wasn't bad. Service was marginal at best
Carnet Vino came highly recommended however right from the start and it was nothing but a sheer disaster.  Sure shit from poor service to the most overpriced meals and unflavorful food we were shocked.  Luckily enough we are getting this meal complementary from the casino if we had to pay out of our pockets for this meal I don't think we would've left ever paying........as other review stated kids size meal portions and lackluster flavor of the steak and even the pastas.  We had better steaks at outback or even chilies this was a joke please stay away!!!!!!!
Excellent food and service. Pasta is fantastic, atmosphere is nice. Drinks are great..especially the blood orange martini.
This restaurant is extremely overpriced for the food delivered. Too many other options in Vegas to come back here.The only positive to the evening was our waiter was a delightful young man. Without him I would give it a 1*.
Unquestionably one of the great restaurants in Las Vegas. Up there with db Brasserie, Sage, and a handful of others. No other LV steakhouse has as much character as this one. Plus the wine list is awesome. And don't forget to try the octopus! Be prepared to spend a small fortune.
Best.Pasta.Ever.. . We knew going in that it was a steakhouse, but we had just eaten steak the night before. Wanting to try Mario Batali's restaurant, we opted for a salad and a sampling of the pastas with a side of the scrumptious potatoes. . . We tried three pastas: Short Rib Beef Ravioli - little pillows of heaven stuffed with tender, succulent short ribs. A definite must try! Bucatini all' Amatriciana - a twist on old fashion spaghetti with a hint of pancetta or guanciale, not sure which. Tagliatelle - a delicate balance of pasta, light sauce, and delectable mushrooms. ...and lastly, the potatoes! Mascarpone & Guanciale Mashed Potatoes - I can almost taste them melting in my mouth. The perfect blend of potatoes, cheese, guanciale and the egg yolk - a first for me. . . Oh, and how can I forget the Tiramisu?! Homemade mascarpone - thick and rich, well balanced, chilled to the perfect temperature. Some of the best I have ever enjoyed. My husband tried the Coconut Cream Bomboloni, which seemed like airy doughnut holes atop a mouthwatering German chocolate like cake frosting. Delish!. . Looking forward to returning to Carnevino, the 'Steakhouse' for more pasta!
