Ellis Island operates 2 restaurants, a cafe and the B-B-Q restaurant.  This review is of our experience at the latter.  We had planned on trying another barbecue restaurant, but after having drinks at Ellis we decided it would be prudent to dine in.  We put our names in and had only a short wait before being seated.   My wife and I each opted for the  1/2 rack of baby back ribs which came with garlic toast, bbq beans and coleslaw.  . . The ribs are steamed prior to a quick flip or two on the grill.   Each was slathered in sauce during the grilling process so I did not feel a need to add any more though YMMV.  The meat was exceptionally tender and delicious though the sides, excluding the coleslaw, were entirely forgettable.  You need to swipe your slot card at the kiosk to get members' pricing, but the system was down this evening so we just presented our cards.  Also, subscribers to the Las Vegas Advisor newsletter receive coupon for Ellis Island that include 2 for 1 for both the Cafe and BBQ restaurant plus 3 free drinks for 2.
Ellis island is a hidden gem of Las Vegas. Sure you might pull up and think to yourself, do I really want to go in? And the answer is yes, yes you do. . . I have frequented EI for years and I have yet to have a bad experience. The food is always on point. Nothing fancy, just good food at great prices. My favorite items on the menu include the chicken fried chicken, the Caesar salad (homemade dressing), the chicken Parmesan, and the breakfast special. You won't find a more solid place that is open 24 hours aday, especially at that price! You won't be disappointed!
Best prime rib for reasonable price. They brew beer in house,  very tasty. Small casino , you might come across some shady people but who cares as long as you mind your business. . Garage parking is bit crazy ... narrow turns . . Just one rest room for whole casino floor , you need to do some across the floor.. Not super clean but bearable .
Off the strip from the glitzy big casinos are the rows upon rows of smaller casinos patronized by the locals.  No dancing water lakes here folks.  Walking through the casino floor the first thing you notice in the smell.  California has basically banished smokers from site or smell, so to walk into one of the less renowned casinos where the ceilings are low, the air filtration is poor, and the gamblers are puffing away like chimneys was an experience.  . . We made it all the way over into the restaurant where the smell was less intense.  I ordered a chorizo burrito.  I wouldn't recommend ordering it, not because it wasn't great, but because it probably doesn't get ordered a lot and it took ages for our food to come out.  Overall, the food is great and it's a good bargain.  Plus you won't be the only one gulping down a beer at 9 in the morning.
$5.99 steak and eggs with 2 slices of toast and crispy potatoes. Steak medium rare done properly. Best place to eat for late night on da strip. Its great service with a great price. :D
We've been going here for years.  Dependable and inexpensive.  Used to love the complete steak dinner special for the price.  Since they raised it we've tried other items and they are good.  Not high end, but a good cheap eats place with craft beer.
What else can I say? $4.99 steak & egg breakfast specials! $7.99 steak dinner comes with potato, green brands, salad, and their own root beer specials!  been there 5 times over 2 Vegas trips. Every time everything always cooked perfectly. Staff is friendly. One thing though, today went there and the steak breakfast wasn't available.:( but that was because it was after 11am during this week (prob because of the CES) but usually it was anytime.however gave me the chance to try the low carb fried chicken special! 4 pieces, non battered, fried, not greasy, with salad. $5.99! Yup, that was good too! BTW, I am a food snob so this review shouldn't be taken lightly. Just go.
Came in to have a very early morning breakfast (or late night snack, if you will).  The host seated me quickly and provided a menu.  Table service was decent though certainly not as prompt as I would have expected.  No overall complaints on the service provided, though.  I just find when I'm by myself having breakfast that I prefer bar service (not available here) so that I can get in and out a little faster than standard table service (a little slow).. . I'd originally hoped for the prime rib they had advertised but they had already run out for the day (which is completely understandable - it was about 4am in the morning after a busy Saturday night).  So instead I ordered the steak and egg breakfast combo.  The steak's flavor was really delicious - cooked perfectly (medium rare on my order) and seasoned very well.  The downside to it was that nearly half of the cut was extremely sinewy and nearly unable to be chewed.  The eggs were ordered sunny side up and delivered perfectly.  The order came with a side of toast and their breakfast potatoes which were both done just right.  Beverage service was pretty good about refilling my glass when it was empty.  Pricewise, the meal was very reasonable and I think that had I taken the time to get a member's card at the casino, I could have even saved more money on the purchase.. . So the overall rating I provided is lower due to lack of service efficiency and the tough, chewy quality of part of the steak.  To be fair, I did not request a different cut of meat - I didn't want to wait for it, so I didn't give them a chance to correct the error, hence I didn't give too low of a review score, either.  I'd recommend going here and based on some of the other Yelp photos I've seen, I will likely be back to try stuff out.  Maybe the prime rib next time...
This place is a hidden gem. Had it not been for all the positive reviews I would not have walked in this place. I ordered the 50/50 burger, two beers and my wife ordered the fish and chips and a soft drink. The burger was full of flavor and definately surprised. I sampled the fish and was thoroughly impressed. Service was great and fast. Walked in on a thursday eve and we were treated to multiple tv's playing nfl. This place is definately worth a trip off the strip. I plan on visiting this place everytime I come to Vegas. Total bill was just over $25.
The ribs. Enough said. . . The pizza. Enough said twice. . . Easily the best value for food in Las Vegas. The entire staff is awesome including the casino manager Ron. . . You HAVE to go here if you're in Vegas.
If you enjoy the smell of stale beer, urine, cigarette butts, sewage, low-lifes, cab drivers, STDs, slots that don't pay, bad food and service, rolling in the gutter, bar-b-q that isn't, "the wrong side of the tracks", eating in public restrooms, trashy places full of trashy customers and employees, KING-8 MOTELS and ghetto karaoke then you will LOVE this dump. I am surprised this place exists and STUNNED by all the 5 star reviews. You want cheap food, ANY fast food joint would be better than ELLIS ISLAND.. .   I retired at age 47 and moved here to Vegas from my hometown of Dallas, 25 years ago. I KNOW what "BAR-B-Q" and good food is. ELLIS ISLAND aint the place to go for either unless you are too wasted/ignorant/naive/gulliable to care. The best BAR-B-Q I have found here in VEGAS is at "ROLLIN SMOKE" on S. Highland Dr. Its REAL "BAR-B-Q" and its good.
Best value in Las Vegas.  Period.. . Enjoyed breakfast, twice, due to quality food and service.  Chicken fried steak  was massive portion.  Hot, high 'diner' quality food.  . . Unless you have the most sensitive pallet in the world you will be well satisfied by everything except the long wait to be seated.  The place is constantly slammed to capacity.  Expect 20 to 30 min wait.
This place is the best for chicken and ribs . Long wait but its absolutley worth it .. super cheap beers which makes the wait time go by fast then only to get huge rib and chicken portions that are delcious . Best ribs in town . Penny slots and karaoke what more can you ask for!!
Ellis Island is a quite a gem out of all Las Vegas Casino! Our group of friends somehow always end up here for all sorts of reasons!. . -Karaoke (9pm-3am Sun-Thurs, till 4am Fri+Sat). -Gambling (no poker available). -Crappy Hours ($3 Craps 5-7pm). -Brewery ($2 Craft beer). -Cheap Eats w/ Quality. . Trust me, the food here is top quality. . -The Cafe is open 24 hours: great late night specials!. -BBQ is open  Sunday-Thursday: 4-10 pm and 11 pm on Friday's + Saturday's.. -Metro Pizza opens daily (closes around midnight): Sunday Special 2 for Price of 1. . . Ellis Island is not your luxury casino, but an old school casino off the strip place where you don't have to break your bank. Ellis's attracts an array of crowds, but I always enjoy my time whenever I am visiting. Till next time, bet on 24 for me!
Amazing food. Prices are great. Sign up for the players card and get steak,mashed potatoes, green beans, and 20 oz beer!!!
Lives up to the expectations!. . Beer is amazing! And only 2 dollars????? I had the fish and chips, my husband the fried chiken basket. First let me start by saying I am not a fan of fish, but it did say it was one of their top sellers and i can see why. The fish and beer batter were delisously seasoned,  crispy on the outside, buttery on the inside without the grease. My husbanbs chicken wad also crisp to perfection, not too much batter,  seasoned,  moist and no extra grease either. The coleslaw that came with the chicken was amazing, fresh, well seasoned without the "I have been in the refrigerator for a month" flavor. The bill came to $27 dollars which included two large beers and two amazing dinners, my only problem with this visist is......why didn't we come here before?. If you choose to come here, please allow at least a 30 minute wait to be seated, this place is popular and it does get busy.
Wow what an cornucopia of meaty goodness this place offers!  Our goal at the beginning of the evening was to pig out at the Caesar's buffet but we encountered a 90 minute wait so we ended up off the beaten path...we ended up at Ellis Island's barbecue restaurant. . . With a players card you get half a rack of ribs and half a chicken for peasant price of $11!!!  I think I'm getting a good understanding of why there's a obesity problem on the U.S.!  . . Ok the ribs were a bit over cooked and the chicken's white meat was on the dry side but when you're talking bang for the buck this joint rocks!  I came in a bit hungry and I left feeling over fed!   . . Service was pretty good here.  The food came out quick and hot. Our drinks were constantly refilled:  my cup truly runneth over that night!  . . Overall, Ellis Island is a hole in the wall, but it provides  the unpretentious an abundance of bbqed meaty goodness!
Micro brewed beers are $2.50 for a giant-sized draft.. . Steak and eggs for less than 10 bucks.. . Pretty decent service.. . Pretty cool place.  . . All locals.  Fewer tourists.  . . I was there the other day for breakfast.  My table was sandwiched between a "Where's Waldo" look alike, who kept asking me questions.....possibly inebriated.... and a "Honey boo boo looking family".  The six of them appeared to be there for a wedding, which they also seemed to be planning over their breakfast.  . . Free entertainment with every meal.
This place has been a personal family tradition for over 40 years. From the days when you could order their 'steak that's not on the menu' for under $9.00, to the raved BBQ Baby Back Ribs, to their NY pizza joint. The food is abundant, inexpensive, and good. 'The place for the locals', the payouts are great, and the vibe is kickback from the craziness hoopla from the Strip. Their legendary karaoke room has been around longer than the fad itself. A strong recommend for any tourist who.wants something other than the Strip.
This place was great 20.00 for breakfast. We were full. People that work there always nice. I had pancakes and sausage no complaints.
