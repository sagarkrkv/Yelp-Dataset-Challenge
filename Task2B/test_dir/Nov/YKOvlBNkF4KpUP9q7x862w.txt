There are 800+ reviews at "The Mission" for a legit reason, the place is really good.. You can come here casually and chill on the patio or go inside for a more classy, intimate environment. This restaurant truly provides an amazingly tasty experience and from what we were told, hosts a renoun chef. Now take what I'm saying with a grain of salt, I am not hispanic so if you are looking for 100% authenticity it might not be here However, this food is still amazingly tasty. Definitely a bit pricy, but for a tourist you should definitely come by here if you are in Old town scottsdale.
Great brunch.  Flavorful food.  Nice margarita selection.   Brisket sandwich is awesome.  Homemade guacamole.  Yum.
The Mission is such a fun, delicious spot! I went there for my second time on Saturday night and thoroughly enjoyed every minute. We got to sit out on the back patio in the beautiful evening weather that was decorated with little white lights. . . Once again I wish I remembered our server's name because he was on point. He greeted our table and shared with us some restaurant and personal favorites without missing a beat on the ingredients in each dish.. . I started with the white wine sangria which was good, grapefruity in my opinion but I still liked it. Our table ordered the table side guacamole and the crispy pork & cola lime glaze as our appetizers. The table side guac is a MUST. They make it right there with about 12 ingredients (I think that's what our server said). It's fresh and creamy, just the way guac should be. The crispy pork & cola lime glaze was amazing and recommended as a restaurant favorite. It was something you can only find at the Mission, which I find important. . . For my main dish, I ordered the Tecate Skirt Steak tacos and my boyfriend got the Pork Shoulder Tacos. The little corn tortillas they prepare are yummy and in house, which is awesome. My steak tacos had a nice grill smokey taste to them. They serve three small, street style tacos but they fill you up quicker than you realize. I recommend ordering a side with the tacos however. My boyfriend and I split the grilled street corn appetizer off the cob as our side. That corn might have been my most favorite dish all night. The pork shoulder was succulent and prepared perfectly.. . One of the gentlemen I was with called the place "froo-froo Mexican." I have to agree, it's upscale Mexican but don't let the deter you from trying it out because the flavor profiles and combinations are unique and phenomenal. Be sure to go when you're willing to spend some money so you get the full experience of The Mission!!
Great drinks, great ambiance, beautiful restaurant.  Everything looked delicious as we were waiting for our table. We pumped for some tacos.. . We ordered guacamole, which was the best we've ever had.  We ordered the duck empanada, expecting a bite or two for each of us.  What came out totally killed our appetite and we promptly got the check and left.  The serving was huge. So rich, and so big.   We couldn't finish it and had no appetite for anything else.  . . Something has to be done about that empanada.  The server should have told us it was as big as a giant size taco bell burrito.  It should have been 1/5 the size.  I don't mean to sound like my dad here either. He is famous for wanting to split 1 oyster among 4 people and then get the check.  . . Would com here again but that duck empanada just killed the night for us.
Great place , sat on the patio the Guacomole was really good The Grouper and the Duck were excellent, then had The French Press. We had a fantastic server Jake I highly recommend this place. Great atmosphere, great food and personal service.
PROS: Fun, romantic environment, very intimate and cozy (great place for a third date or special occasion). Very helpful and attentive service. AMAZZZZZING PUMPKIN BREAD PUDDING!!! I don't know if it's just seasonal, but anytime of the year it would be a treat! We had the MAHI MAHI TACOS and the SHORT RIB TACOS. Both were savory, but much smaller than we expected (think medallion size), and the short ribs could have been more tender. They were a bit dry, but still tasty. . . CONS: TABLE-SIDE GUACAMOLE. If you have a low tolerance for spicy flavors, definitely get mild or not spicy at all. We ordered the medium, and it was wayyyy to spicy, practically inedible for us. The PORTION sizes were far too small and the food was expensive for what was on the plate. Also, the MIMOSA was ok, but was a bit strong. I was expecting more orange juice with a splash of champagne and maybe a strawberry, but this was champagne with a splash of orange juice.
08.30.14. . Cute spot for brunch. A dark contrast to the blazing sun outside. Great cocktails (and the waiter is extremely knowledgeable and can recommend some delicious drinks).. . Must order: tableside guacamole. Just do it.. . If you like steak, order the Tecate Marinated Skirt Steak. Make sure you add an egg. They may throw in an extra egg, just for kicks. Accept this gift.. . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-mission-scottsdale?select=m4ERxBHYvOyp4rsMGkjorw#m4ERxBHYvOyp4rsMGkjorw
Had my 32nd bday party here on the elegant outside patio. Everything from the menu, service, food, wine list  and ambiance was perfect. I absolutely loved the table side guacomole !!!!! It's a must have and I could have eaten it for a meal and been happy.
Sat at the bar...great bartender, very friendly. I am a fan of sitting at the bar at most establishments whenever possible because I feel the service is better. Plus, if I am solo, I don't feel so awkward. The guac was decent. The short rib tacos were very good but tiny. My bloody mary was nice and spicy, just like me. The espresso churros I got to end the meal were a more generous portion and where quite good. I liked the decor of The Mission also. I would give it a 3.5, however I am rounding down to 3 because of the price (yelp should consider half-stars).
We had a really wonderful dinner here....and not only because our waiter could easily have been a model... he was lovely and sadly I've already forgotten his name. I digress... . . While I was in town for a conference we heard this place was awesome. On a side note, the bathroom is super cool... We ate out on the patio & they are so nice they even set down cloth napkins for us to set our purses on (is this an out west thing?) Anyhow, we all ordered various specialty drinks and we were all pleased with out choices. We started off with the quac, which they make table side. It was delicious and the chips were also good. The quac is spicy because they do put jalapenos in it if you like (which we did!). I had Mahi tacos because after the quac and late lunch I wasn't particularly starving. The tacos were delicious. If you are starving, this would probably not be enough food for you, but perfect for a light meal. My dining companions were also pleased with their meals. The service was great and we never felt rushed or hurried, and they had just the right amount of attentiveness. I would eat here again if I ever roll through town again.
Quite honestly the best restaurant I've been to in Scottsdale.  The service, drinks, and food were all phenomenal.  Will not disappoint.
There's a reason that there's 800+ reviews averaging 4 stars...it's quite a dining experience, especially sitting in the outside patio section trimmed with beautiful white lights. We had a group of 7 and our waitress was menu knowledgeable and provided great recommendations (including tequila!). The guacamole was out of this world...but the entree portions are a bit small...so don't come here super hungry...or be ready to drop quite a few pretty pennies
The avocado margarita changed my life, It really isn't the first thing that jumps in my mind when ordering a margarita...but I have to say it was one of the tastiest blended rita's I have guzzled....yeah no lady like behavior going on here.   This place is a must experience when visiting the Southwest.  They do a wonderful job executing southwest cuisine with a modern twist.  also don't leave without trying the Elote.
The food was amazing. Had the guacamole and the shrimp tacos. The pablano grits are amazing. I will definitely be back.
Love The mission!! I have been to mission probably 10 times and everytime is great. Love the decor. Primarita Margarita is my favorite cocktail there. Less calories, but delicious and fresh. The guac is delish and my favorite is the Tecate steak tacos. Best tacos I have ever had! Ok, so there is only 3, but don't let your eyes fool your stomach. There is so much perfectly marinated meat on those 3 tacos it is the perfect amount. We went on Thanksgiving and Tom the manager made us feel especially welcome and appreciated. Usually at end of dinner I have the French Press coffee, but only at The Mission because their blend is so delicious. It's like drinking cinnamon chocolate coffee. Mission is more expensive than most Mexican restaurants,  but you can tell the food quality is extremely important to them. I have no problem paying a little more for fresh, great quality food. It's totally worth it!
