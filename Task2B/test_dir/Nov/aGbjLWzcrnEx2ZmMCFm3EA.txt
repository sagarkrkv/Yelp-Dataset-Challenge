Went with a group of friends so we sampled a lot of different items. The toppings were different and not something I would normally add but I'm glad I tried. That being said, I didn't think the actual flavor in the patty was all that great. Especially with burger places being all the rage I guess I expected a little more. That being said it was a neat experience.
Overpriced, plain, simple burgers that took forever to arrive. The fries were fine, but also overpriced. This place seems to be a fad, lots of people waiting in line, presumably they, like us, also thought it was gonna be good. We had to wait an hour to be seated, we were expecting at least an average meal. Do not recommend.
Cant fault a single thing about this place. We had the Hells Kitchen Burger and a side of parmesan truffle fries and we were in heaven. I loved this place so much I wanted to go back for dinner.
Food was good, served quickly - worked out great after the Britney Spears concert for dinner. At times I feel like places like this try to do too much with items on the menu just to be different but overall it was good. Ketchup for example was just odd, we tried three different ones, all were a bit odd.. . Had the Hells Kitchen burger, great flavor.. . Server was a bit inattentive, the other table helpers did all the work while he was chatting with another table for an extended period of time.. . A bit pricey, but then again it's Vegas.
There are burgers then there are burgrs. Been here 3 times now and damn if the food isn't consistently amazing! The farm burger is second to none. The duck bacon is ridiculously good rivals real bacon and that says something. If you are in Vegas and want to taste what a real burger is come here. Waitresses are always great knowledgeable and friendly. There can be a wait so get there early. Beers on tap are awesome as well Sam Adams cherry is awesome. Don't let me forget the jalapeno poppers which have no equal wow these are amazing. To finish the meal the toffee pops are awesome and unique. Go here you won't be sorry.
I came here with my wife and daughter, a few weeks ago visiting Las Vegas in order to attend a friends wedding.  The food was amazing, I ordered the Britannia Burger which was soooooo amazingly good. My wife ordered the Blue Burger and my daughter ordered the American Burger we were all very happy. We all shared an order of Onion Rings - they were out of this world!!!. . I would have given my experience 5 stars unfortunately, the service was quite poor.  When we arrived we asked how long the wait was, they told me it would be 45 mins they took my name and number and told me I would be texted when we could sit down at our seat.  45 min later no text came when I asked how much longer the wait would be I was told it would be over an hour. And that my name had never registered in their system. I had to complain to 5 different people when they finally deemed it appropriate to let us sit at one of the several open tables.
Stopped in here Thursday night and ate at the bar.. Started off with the sknny screw - was declious.. . Then the highlight of our night - THE BURGERS. AMAZING!. No joke - the best burger I ever had.. I wish I could get another one right now, but I will have to wait for my next trip out there for it!. . Then there was the sweet potato fries (WITH POWDERED SUGAR) Omg- to die for!  We just loved them!. . Only reason they got 4 stars was because it took 32 minutes for our food to come out.  I know there were busy, but its vegas - they should have those kinks worked out to keep things running smoothly on busy Thursday evening.. . Overall - I def recommend and will return.
Great food. Great chefs . Great atmosphere . I would definitely eat here again, five star burgers, and we came really late near closing the night we went and instead of being rude to our group, they gave us free desert! Loved it, awesome food
The husband and I came here after a concert. The sign specifically says to check in with hostess before lining up - USELESS. After talking to them we were directed back in line with no changes BUT like after 5 parties behind. Why would you have directions that you guys don't abide by?! Anyway, this place has a very different feel. The workers' uniforms look they belong in the Star Trek movie. Our waitress was nice but she dropped the husband's glass full of tea. Said a sorry and had someone else clean it up. A glass of tea nor water was not offered after. The Just Fries came out cold - of course they would since they were just sitting out like the other sweet potato and parmesan fries. Hell's Kitchen Burger was pretty mediocre. Their buns are thick and filled with too many black sesame seeds. It was a first time experience, don't ever see ourselves coming back since we'll most likely get Earl of Sandwiches instead. On the bright side, I DO love their wide spacious and comfortable chairs!
Are here by recommendation from a friend that said the burgers here were world-class. The way the burgers are prepared and the level of service were very unique, a few of us friends went out to dine here and enjoyed the atmosphere. The wait times can be long to get in so make sure you have a reservation or a lot of extra time on your hands. The jalapeno poppers were a lot of fun
One of the best burgers I ever had. Even with no pink the burger was juicy. The Parmesan truffle fries were literally the best and I've had my share. Lots of parmesan and truffle oil they just explode with flavor. Delicious!!
Went to experience Gordon Ramsay BurGR on Halloween and it did not disappoint.. . It was very busy but our waitress was great and very attentive. She explained the drink menu and told us the special of the day. The drink menu is interactive on an Ipad which is cool. I ordered a jalapeno margarita and it was delicious - expensive as Hell at $14 but what do you expect, it's Gordon Ramsay and it's Vegas. . . We started off with the roasted jalapeno poppers. They were very good. Served in six individual little shot glasses filled with bacon ranch. We all really enjoyed these. I had the damnation chicken burger which was amazing! It had carrot and celery slaw with buffalo sauce and ranch and maytag bleu cheese. The flavor was incredible. Our table also had an order of the garlic parmesan truffle fries. They were good but not my favorite. For the price I don't think I would order them again. I would try the onion rings instead.. . Overall my experience here was great. Service was good, food was amazing. It is expensive but it is worth it. You are paying for both the food and the experience.
If you are a 7* or a Diamond player you can get next seating,, otherwise it's a long wait, which is why I rated in 4 instead of 5 stars. . The service and attitude from the minute you get there is friendly and upbeat. They actually seemed please you chose to eat there. . There were 4 of us and we each tried a different burger. The Euro was probably the best, though the jalapeno was a close second. . I like that they kept you change things (I added fried egg).  Wasn't too crazy about the fries or the sauces that came with them, but I like my fries thin and crispy. I don't eat sweet potato fries but everyone thought they were delicious. . Can be a long wait, but if think worth it. Not cheap, but not over the top like many restaurants in Vegas. Bon appetite
A large group of us dined here before the Britney show.  It's definitely a good burger spot.  We shared a bunch of starters which were all delicious - soba noodle salad, green salad, buffalo chx wings, along with their variety of fries.  We were all stuffed by the time our burgers arrived.  I ordered one with goat cheese, roasted tomato and truffle aioli.  The truffle was not overpowering and just enough.  . . They have a ton of surrounding TVs and a good option if you're at planet hollywood. Although I wouldn't make it a destination.
Hamburger was number 1 to me. The hummus I had before was also delicious. Generous portions and good prices. Worthed!
Well I am a big fan Chef Ramsey and his styles of food so I am biased, I had the pork burger, was a great spin a burger.  Truffle fries are a must get, and the chipotle ketchup was great as well.  The atmosphere is loud and modern, we enjoyed that.  . The waitstaff was the part not quite up to par with what I would expect from a GR restaurant.  They could be a bit more attentive and less social with each other and pay attention to the customers.  . The wait was fine, greeters were nice.. Overall it's a $50-$75 burger trip, but the uniqueness and experience is worth it.
Seriously people go here!!!!! The fries are to die for especially the parmasean ones. The truffle dip is so good we had our waiter brings us more! Burgers were outstanding and the service was great. I mean everything was just outstanding about this restaurant.
First time at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and he definitely didn't disappoint. My sister and I both agreed this was probably the best burger we've had so far. It's not very big, but if you order fries too you'll definitely be full. We got the Hell's Kitchen special, which came with spicy pepper, avocado and cheese. Everything blended together very well and each bite was so soft and easy. We also ordered the truffle parmesan fries, which were delicious. . . I'm docking a star for two reasons though. The first is that they actually cooked our burger wrong the first time. We asked for medium but it came out medium rare, so we requested a redo. The other was that our waiter was not very good and had an attitude. There was another female waitress that was way more attentive to us even though I don't think we were one of her tables.. . This spot doesn't take reservations, so go early when it's not rush hour or on days that are slower. I'd come back for sure though to try some of the other burger selections, and highly recommend a visit if you're ever in the area!
My 15 year old son adores Gordon Ramsay so he wanted to go to Burgr for his birthday.  I ordered the burger with goat cheese arugula and truffle mayo.  We ordered three sides including onion rings, buffalo wings and of course the Truffle Parmesan fries.  Service was good but rushed enough that our waitress got my son's order wrong. Said no veg on the burger and she heard it as "lettuce."  Letting that one slide.  Anyhow all the food was great except for the wings which were disappointingly pedestrian.  Will go back again when the craving hits me.. . . TLDR:  Burgers cooked exactly as desired with rich beef flavor.  A burger worthy of GR'S name.  Truffle Parmesan fries luscious and a must have here.  Skip the wings.  Service is very good for an upscale burger place.  Don't worry about the wait if there is more than 2 in your party; they will text you when your table is ready.
First of all. I'm a fan of chef ramsay and hope every thing perfect.  This is first time i try this burger.  When i walk to the host two girl cute asian just talk to each another and doesn't look at me. Until o ask for table for 1 they offer me to sit at bar it ok for me but she just point to bar and say go ahead snd back to talk to each another again. . The burger need more salt it no test and asian salad is so so. It not matt for 14$ for burger and 13 for salad. In&out is alot bettet.
The food was great, it was what happened a bit afterwards that has caused some concern.  When I went to pay for the meal the waiter came back and said my card was declined, which is weird because I know I had money in my bank account (debit card) so I gave him my credit card and that seemed to go through fine.  Sometime later both of those cards were compromised...coincidence????  Not sure, it does seem a bit odd that they both had copies made from them and someone near Nevada was trying to do some serious charging.  Be careful with your cards people.  Thank goodness my institutions both saved me from what could have been a serious nightmare.  If I go back it will definitely be a cash basis situation.
Great service. Knowledgeable, attentive, fast, and friendly.. . I ordered the chicken sliders and they were perfect. The chicken was breaded and perfectly fried while keeping the inside super moist. Loved the toasted sesame seed buns too. Co-worker had the hells kitchen burger and said it was amazing. Side of fries were a big soggy and disappointing though. Came with two different kinds of ketchup so that was cool.
I love coming to Gordon Ramsay Burgr, especially when we get Michelle for our waitress!. The best service, food always delivered hot and perfect!!. Try the chicken burger's they are amazing!!. Ask to sit in Michelle's station!!
Let me begin by saying, I am TOTALLY BIASED!  My dream was to eat at a Gordon Ramsay (@GordonRamsay) restaurant.  Even if this was #Burgr , I got to check an item off of my Bucket List today.. . I was thrilled that I had the opportunity to get to Planet Hollywood to visit the establishment.  The striking flaming entrance window is awe inspiring.  My heart skipped a beat because it was everything I wanted in a Ramsay establishment.. . I sat down and loved the menu layout.  You actually get to keep it (awesome fan appreciation).  I almost jumped on the Hell's Kitchen Burger but went with the Farm Burger Recommendation.  It includes a fried egg and duck breast bacon.. . The burger was a perfect Medium Rare and very tender.  The egg was not overcooked so it basted the burger as intended.  The bacon was uniquely delicious on a perfectly firm toasted bun. A huge order of fries was perfectly salty and crisp.  I am not a huge eater so it went mostly untouched when compared to the splendor of the Burger!  Yumm!. . The service is extremely efficient.  They are professionally friendly but a little Vegas Plastic.  Highly recommended and I am thrilled to death to say I have been there!!!!!
Because I ordered to-go, I was allowed to skip the line outside the door and order immediately. My food came out in a timely manner and the girl that took care of me was very prompt, personable, genuine, and sweet! I immediately took my food to my hotel room and the food was still hot and very fresh. I wasted no time digging in, but was a little disappointed. I ordered the Fury Chicken Wings and the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers. The wings were big and meaty (yum!) but I did not enjoy the blue cheese in combination with the tangy sauce, but that's just my personal preference and not a poor reflection of the restaurant (usually I love blue cheese!) The jalapeno poppers had a nice breading, delicious cheese/ranch, but the jalapenos inside tasted bland and soggy! The first one I ate was pretty spicy, but the rest of the poppers had little to no spice and severely lacked that jalapeno flavor that I was craving. . . I couldn't finish my meal so I wandered down stairs and ended up with a slice of pizza. . . TL;DR: the fury wings were deliciously meaty, but I'd prefer to leave off the blue cheese as I'm not a huge fan of the flavor combo. The jalapenos inside the poppers were very bland and lacked flavor.
The food was great and so were the prices.  It may not have been the best burger I'vehad in my life, but the bun was delicious and the sides were also.  I would definitely return.
One of the best burgers I've ever had! I had the Hell's Kitchen burger, so yummy! I would come back for sure and try the Farm burger.
Had the American Burger was okay. My husband really enjoyed it. Had the Truffle frys and really didn't like them. My husband thought they were ok. Overall we would come back.
Pork belly bao buns were decent, though not the best. But their euro burger was delicious! Truffle Parmesan fries with aioli dip was perfect. And their shakes topped with pudding is a genius invention. Everything was delicious! Eat here.
When I first saw this restaurant, I didn't know what to expect. The outside looked cool, but I thought a celebrity-themed restaurant just had the makings of a let down with a big sell and low performance. I couldn't have been more wrong. From the moment I walked up to the hostess stand, the service, food quality, and overall presentation were spectacular. The burger I ordered was cooked to perfection and stayed hot the entire time. The food is very unique (I highly recommend the Parmesan onion rings). You won't be disappointed if you like good meat and good burgers. This is on my to-do list next time I come back to Vegas.
There was a long line even after 2p, but it was worth the wait.  Burgers average $15 and up but taste good.  It looked deceivingly small, but my Earth Burger had more portobello than I had ever seen.  Everything is a la carte.  The fries with curry ketchup were good.  Mom had Soba  Chicken Noodle Salad which was surprisingly delicious.  Definitely check it out.   Very good food and service.
I think this place is overrated. The food was good, but not worth waiting in line for. Luckily I came here right when it opened for lunch on a weekday, and didn't have to wait at all. . . The service here is great. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable about the beers they had on tap. The place is very modern, and the flame-lit sign outside is pretty cool. . . We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, and the Farm Burger. The Hell's Kitchen burger was just OK. The peppers tasted a bit pickled, which I wasn't expecting. The Farm Burger was very good. It came with a fried egg with a runny yolk, and duck bacon. We ordered parmesan truffle tries which were very good. I think one order is good for two people, or even three if you don't eat a lot of fries. . . Overall, not bad, but I don't think I'd visit again since there's probably other places to eat.
The food is five stars.  Easy.  Order anything on the menu (order everything on the menu), and unless you are a vegetarian who somehow ordered a meat burger, you will likely not be disappointed.  I'd suggest splitting a shake because that is an awful lot of sweetness with the pudding and ice cream and milk shakey stuff, but it's great if you're feeling decadent.  Which you do, because you're in Vegas.. . What I had to remove points for was the service, which was slow as hell.  We had to wait about 30-45 minutes for our burgers, which is pretty damn unacceptable.  There's also likely to be a line in front, but that's more understandable.  Was it worth the wait?  I'm honestly not sure because it got really, really annoying.. . I've seen Hell's Kitchen, I know how Ramsay would react to the food taking this long.. . Recommended:. Fuckn burgrs, obviously.  + Fries + Milk Shake.
Hell's Kitchen burgr  medium rare, perfectly juicy and fatty. It had the perfect kick. . The farm burgr is not balanced. Too much meat and no veggies, so it wasn't that good, but the egg was nice and runny.. The pork Bao meat was dry but and sauce was spot on.
Located at Planet Hollywood hotel and casino.  Entrance by Las Vegas strip.. . Paper menus are designed so that you can keep one as a souvenir if you desire. The gourmet burgers have various names and combination of ingredients. . . I chose the Farm Burger and hubby decided on the Gordon Ramsay burger which is not on the menu.. . The Farm Burger is a cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg.  I'm a traditionalist so I removed the egg and gave it to hubby.  His Gordon Ramsay burger was too junky for me.  He liked it.. . One of the Hell's Kitchen 10th season contestant winners runs the kitchen.  She wasn't there the day we ate there.   Cynthia is her name according to our server.. . Juicy hot burger served on a sesame brioche bun.. . The truffle Parmesan cheese fries were yummy too.. . I like all the glass and fire in the restaurant.   After all, it's Hell's Kitchen.. . I'd come again.   Pricey.   We charged the bill to our room.
I will start with a WOW!! this place is amazing, my family and I went to celebrate a birthday and the whole experience was great! Service was outstanding, our server was Ashley and she put so much attention to detail and always had an awesome attitude..another thing we noticed is that everybody working at this place looks like models, all great looking people!!  are we going back?? YES WE ARE...FOOD IS AMAZING, EVERYTHING COOKED TO PERFECTION!!
Overall:. As a fan of the Masterchef series, I gave BurGR a decent shot when I came to Vegas. Honestly, they had subpar service and burger quality. For a decent burger, please head to the Burger Bar by Hubert Keller at Mandalay Bay.. . Ambience/Service:. This place has quite a long wait, even at ~10pm at night. The staff seated us at the bar because the tables were full. The bartender was attentive, but a tad rude. I think it took ONE HOUR for the food to arrive. It was quite a brutal wait time given that we just drove 6 hours to get the Vegas.. . Food:. I think their burgers and fries have a lot of room for improvement. Both burgers we ordered were dry and tasteless as the patties were under-seasoned. The fries were soggy. After this disappointing experience, I kept on searching for a decent burger in LV and found that Burger Bar has waaayyyyyyy better burgers. Save your money and head straight to Mandalay Bay.
Truffle parmesean fries...to die for. The aioli really tips them over the *best ever* edge. Their staff is wonderful and extremely helpful. My husband elbowed his glass off the table by accident, it shattered and it was terribly embarassing.  The staff, however, made a crappy situation much better. They swifty cleaned, offered help, gave first aid and also made me feel comfortable enough that neither he nor I died of embarassment. You can imagine how many eyes were on us lol. Anyway,  Burgr is awesome. Go there!
Good food. Nice environment. This is a popular place so you can expect a wait but worth the wait. Servers are all pleasant. Large variety of beer!
Burger was bland and expensive. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger, which is really just a burger with tomatoes and avocado. I really was hoping for something special here but it did not impress at all. Everyone in my group thought the same, just bland. +1 for the onion rings, they were good.
Friday night the line was super long. . . Waitress was friendly.. . We ordered burgers and shared one order of the truffle fries.. . The wait for the burger was long too.. . But everything was really tasty. We had the farm burger and the Euro burger had goat cheese. A real acquired taste.
For some reason when I hear that a restaurant is owned by a television personality I start to prepare myself for a disappointing experience. I don't know where it comes from ( *coughs* Giadas *cough*) but I feel like it will be all hype and not flavor. Then the trepidation sinks in. . . I walked up to the front of the restaurant which is stunning. There is a glass wall with these metal figures in a wave formation. They are blowing fire out the sides and it makes for a flashy sign. This is a photo opportunity for sure. If there so happens to be a line it will wrap around this so you will have plenty of time to get your selfies in.. . When we were sat I had a very attentive waiter. He kept everything prompt and didn't make me feel like another table which is usually the case with most waiters. i realize you are turning tables but I would like to go to a restaurant that has all this hype and also enjoy my experience, just not the food.. . We started the meal with the truffle fries. Why? Because truffle anything is delicious and if you fail at that I will deduct a star automatically. This was not one of those cases. In fact, it was one of the best truffle fries I have ever had. Scratch that, lets make it the best truffle fries that I have ever had. The reason why is the sauce it came with for you to dip in it. It had some kind of curry ketchup which wasn't anything special. I don't even remember what it taste like. Anyways, the star player was the truffle aioli. I would put this shit on everything if I could get my hands on it. But unfortunately we live in an unforgiving bitter world, so ill just have to travel in order to eat an aioli. Get this as a starter, shit, get two. . . We also got these jalapeno poppers that were really good. Jalapenos to me are sort of a Russian roulette ingredient when its raw. Let me explain, if its fresh the pepper can have different degrees of heat from other of the same pepper. I seem to have gotten the hottest one because my mouth was on fire. Everyone else in my party that had one acted as if they at a bell pepper. Im addicted to heat but I could swear they gave me a habenero instead. So be warned.. . Now to the burger itself, I got the uber cheese burger. It was good but I quickly regretted my order when I tried my friends farm burger. OMG, so much better than a boring cheese burger. This was one of the most flavorful burgers Ive had in awhile. The yolk dripping on all the bacon and ingredients filled me with envy. Get this burger and avoid the cheese burger. Thats what I get for going the basic route. Never again.. . Finally dessert, STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING. This dessert made chocolate taste like shit. This was so delicious and its crazy how good it is. The mystery ingredient in it is dates and the sauce has whiskey in it. Two things LOATHE, but put it in this dessert and it becomes the best dessert I have ever had.... point blank... period.... end of story. Found a copycat recipe online and have been making it every week now. . . Completely addicted.
I had really high expectations for BurGR, and while the meal was enjoyable I had to take down the rating a notch because of the horrible stomachache I had a couple hours after eating. I had the Euro burger, which included a roasted tomato, goat cheese, and arugula on top of the patty. I found the patty to be on the dry side, but the fixings were a fresh change. On the other hand, their truffle fries were really good as it was the first time I had truffle fries on thick-cut steak fries. My boyfriend also tried the Oreo milkshake with creme brulee, but while the Oreo portion was good, the creme brulee made the whole thing a little sickly sweet. In my opinion, Gordon Ramsay's name overhypes the place and you can definitely find better burgers in Vegas.
--------------------------------------------------. ESSENTIAL TIPS & EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:. --------------------------------------------------. # If you don't have a Total Rewards card, make one...it's free just like the M Life rewards card! You'll save a $1 off every item on the menu. You can get a card from a membership desk at...just to name a few....Bally's, Paris, Caesar's Palace, and Planet Hollywood (helloooo you're basically there if you're dining at BurGR). . # Juicy and tasty burgers packed with umami sensation. Good job, Gordon! But I still think you're full of yourself. There's Gordon Ramsay Steak, Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill, and then clever go! BurGR. What happened to the "E", Gordon! Can't you spell? Oh, the GR stand for your initials? Pompous prick...but nice work on the burgers. . . # My friend and I ordered what seemed to be the 2 most popular burgers. Hell's Kitchen and the Farm Burger. Surprisingly, I preferred the Hell's Kitchen burger are a bit more than the latter even though it had duck breast bacon. I think it's because having a little bit of spice balances out the super umami sensation you get. Where's the pickle when you need one?. . # Truffle fries were excellent so order it. To date, these are the best fries I've had because they sorta have that glassy crust. I'm certain they cook their fries several times to achieve this texture. Beautifully done. . . # I wasn't able to try the shakes, but I'll report back next time. I don't think you'll go wrong in choosing any one of the 5 shakes. . . # If the estimated wait time is more than 30 minutes, don't go. Come another day.The burgers are good, but not worth waiting an hour for. . . # I wouldn't come here with a group with more than 4 people (standard table size) or else you may be waiting longer. . . # Although it's cool, avoid sitting by the flaming fire display. You get pretty warm just by sitting next to it. . . --------------------------------------------------. MY EXPERIENCE: . --------------------------------------------------. My friend and I were able to tolerate 20 minutes of waiting. We agreed that the burgers were good. Truffle fries were excellent. Our beers were fine and we were too full to try and tackle the shakes. We drove back home. The End.
I couldn't write a bad enough review. The sauces are horrible. The place is filthy. The jalapeno poppers are filled with cheap cheese Tabasco sauce mix. And came out cold. Disgusting. Do not eat here. Even if it's free. Run away quickly!!!!
Amazing burger and great experience. Wait staff was so friendly. The unique burger flavor combinations paired were wonderful.
Best shake ever!! Fries was great!. Everything was sooo good!!. Always appreciate the good food!!
I've eaten at a few Ramsay restaurants and Burgr doesn't disappoint. Is the line long? You bet- and for good reason. Glad we didn't have to wait at all in line. There's a way to not have to wait, but I'll let everyone complaining about the line figure it out on their own. Meanwhile, we'll skip the line while those with self-appointed 'foodie degrees' give this place a poor rating simply because they don't know the simple way to avoid said line. . The Earth Burger is delicious. Yes, it's vegetarian. The truffle parmesan fries are amazing and the 'Skinny Screw' cocktail tastes like Kool-Aid. Four of those with dinner and I was ready to party all night! . The banana, snickerdoodle, butterscotch shake.... WOW! . Perfect wait staff, fast service. Spot on. Love how your bill comes accompanied by an iPhone with a survey to rate your experience. Nice to see someone cares. . Overall- I'd highly recommend this place. We'll definitely be back!
WAY OVERRATED. My wife was bugging me to try the hamburger - I finally gave in. If not for all the add ons, like cheese , sauces , onions etc. - it would have been even more bland than it was. We were both disappointed.  Certainly not worth $19! Fries were good, but they don't make up for a very mediocre burger. This place is a fraud.
Spectacular! It was the best welcome meal to Vegas, I would have to say. We just got off the plane, put our stuff in the hotel room and grabbed a cab for the best burger joint. It was certainly the best! Mind you, all of us ladies were HONGRY, just got off the plane BUZZED, and we were dying. . . My burger, I think it was the Farm Burger, had a fried egg in it, and that was the one that sealed the deal for me. It was SLAMMIN!!!. . Our server was mighty cute too. I think I lost my game. In my single days, I woulda been flirting and making witty comments, but each time he came to check on us, I got hella quiet. Haha. See, that's what marriage did to me!!!
It was alright; a little overrated, but the food was just OK. . . The service was exceptional, however! Loved the atmosphere created in their from their uniforms to how they all interacted with us. Our server was very attentive and a TON of fun. The hostess was very accommodating despite how crazy busy they were. The manager even swung by to say hello and see how we were doing, which was cool.. . I was just a little bit disappointed by the lack of menu options and some of the burger combinations. I was anticipating menu options other than burgers, in addition to the appetizers that they had. We split the Parmesan fries and the hummus. I will say, the hummus was REALLY great... it's salt and vinegar hummus! Served with some super yummy toasted veggies that had a great crispy crunch and seasoning to them.. . Our burger presentation was fabulous, but the taste was just ok. The hummus really took the cake on this meal! I finished up with a creme brulee pudding oreo shake! It was pretty awesome, but rich enough for all three of us to share.
One of the 'hunger stops' on the Strip...... The ambience of the place was WOW, didn't have lot of wait time as it was a week day.. Coming to the food, we had the Damnation and Earth Burgers, nicely presented and taste was good, not really out of the world as our expectations were.. The onion rings and jalapeno poppers were tasty.. On the whole we did feel the place is a bit over-rated, but it was our first experience of a 'Gordon Ramsay' restaurant so we ain't complaining! :). Oh and the location is great, right beside the Miracle Mile Shops.
Although fairly expensive, this is one of the better burgers on the strip. I appreciate that the menu is clearly opinionated about its burgers - no extra condiments are provided (though I suppose you could ask) - and there is a good collection of burgers that you might not find elsewhere. I'd strongly suggest just picking one and not altering it. It might not be what you'd normally order, but you'll get something quite unique and tasty.
My boyfriend and I live in Vegas and went here for the first time last month, and it was a big waste of money. This place is only successful because of where it is located and because it has a celebrity's name in the title. Portions are small, food is bland. I wouldn't recommended this place. Spend your hard earned money, on somewhere else.
I've been hearing a lot about this place from my friends. So when I was in vegas we decided to stop by and give it a try. The service was great! We were greeted and seated fast, our waitress was very helpful and attentive. Our food came out at a good pace. We started with the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers, Truffle Parmasan Fries, and the Maui Onion Rings. THOSE WERE DELICIOUS!!! All were so crunchy and packed with flavor!!! They were served with this cheddar ranch sauce that just upped the flavor also! I highly recommend getting it when you visit! My husband ordered the Euro Burger and loved it! Normally he doesn't eat goat cheese, but he was going to town with his burger hahaha he kept talking about how delicious and perfectly season the meat was and how it goes so well with the goat cheese. I should have tried it hahaha... My son ordered the Farm burger it had duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar cheese, and a fried egg... He loved it! He even wanted to go back the next day to eat again... hahaha... I got the Chanterelle Burger, it had mushrooms, arugala, and fig jam... it was very good... but I didn't get the same OMG its delicious factor like my guys did... hahaha... I felt like I should have ordered something else. The meat was seasoned perfectly on my burger but I guess the mushroom flavor just a bit too strong for me. For dessert we ordered a shake... we got the Creme Brulee with Oreo cookies shake... Brace yourself... for the best shake in your life!!! IT WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!!! I know it sounds like it would be super sweet, but to my surprise it wasn't as sweet as I expected. The creme brulee part had pieces of the crunchy topping mixed into it and so did the oreo portion... At this point my son was fighting off severe food coma... he had eaten so much hahaha... he took a few sips of the shake and that was the perfect ending to his night before he knocked out sleeping at the restaurant... haha ... what is a mother to do besides finish off his shake LOL... LISTEN... if we were there and he fell asleep again... i would finish it off again! LOL... Over all this place is delicious!!! I would recommend it to any of my friends!!! I can't wait to go back to vegas just eat here again!
Ate here with my husband for the first time today for lunch. Husband and I agree it was a 5! Gregg was our server today - he was nice friendly and gave is great suggestions. We had the jalapeno poppers - spicy and tasty! I had the farm burger - juicy and cooked just right. I was so full after and so glad I got that one. Husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger - a spicy delight. He lets try his - it was also super good. I got a shake as well. The chocolate and Carmel shake. It's very sweet and filling. My he chocolate is like a malt and the Carmel is a true flavor to the candy taste. I was stuffed after the burger and shake and had no room left in my belly! Really glad we came here for lunch! Yummy!
Zipped in for their awesome sweet potato fries (best ever?) cooked to perfection & the #4 shake! Great afternoon snack. Chilled out at the back bar. Good service. I like the burgers at Guy F's better.
As a fan of Gordon Ramsay, to me this place does live up to the hype!. . You can say this place was built for tourists and conventioneers, but damnit, it is good!. . After seeing BurGR featured on Master Chef in a challenge, I was keen on checking this place out on my next visit to Las Vegas.. . My gf and I arrived on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon to a short line up.  We took a gander at the amazing flaming signage of BurGR inside Planet Hollywood. Within 10 minutes, we were promptly seated.. . Our server Brandon was very welcoming and friendly, making us feel at ease.  Throughout the lunch service, he regularly checked in on us and made sure our waters were refilled. He also recommended a great beer pairing with my burger.   Since my gf loves ice tea (the kind you get in Canada), Brandon was aware that Las Vegas didn't have it so he had the bar made up something similar that more than met her standards for a great lemony iced tea, which made her very happy! . . I had the Farm burger while she had the Euro burger.  Cooked to medium rare, the burgers were juicy and melt in your mouth.  Balanced perfectly, my Farm burger's duck bacon and fried egg, more than complimented the flavors of the juicy beef patty.  The Euro burger according to her could have used a little less blue cheese, but nevertheless she thought it was amazing still with arugula!  The burger buns were fluffy and crisp, as were the fantastic truffle fries, whose portions were more than enough to share for two persons!. . Sign up for Total Rewards (it's FREE!) to get $1 off all of the items on the menu!. . Well done Ramsay and staff, you donkey!! ;-)
BURGR. . There are TVs, music is not to loud, Decor is modern. No outside seating, lots of drink and beer selection, parking at miracle mile then walking in towards  north is easiest to find it. . Ordered the Gordon. Not on menu yet. It was good. Different from the usual beef patty. My friend ordered the farm burger and it looked excellent. I should of ordered that, but wanted to try something new. . . Truffle Parmesan Fries. We're good. The dipping sauces were great. Fries weren't over done but soft. . . Jalapeno Poppers . We're great, dipping sauce was good. Breading wasn't to thick was just right. . . Service was great. Waitress got our order in fast since we were in a rush. Service still excellent. Gratuity was already added to our check since we had a big party
If you are looking for a basic burger made to PERFECTION, Ramsay's Burgr delivers.  Hubby and I visited last year when we went to Vegas.  I wasn't a yelper at that time, so that's the reason the review comes so late.  My only two complaints was it's difficult to find and the seating is very close together so you feel like you are eating with your neighbors.  Other than that though, our experience was fantastic!  We had the blue cheese burger and I think hubby had a regular cheese burger plus sweet potato fries.  Those fries and burgers were TO DIE FOR!!!!  Juicy, perfectly cooked, lots of flavor, and excellent service.  It does get pretty busy, even during non-peak time we had a short wait.  We also had to wait a bit for our food.  Well worth the wait though.  We watch Master Chef and Kitchen Nightmares.  Ramsay is always talking about the importance of being able to make a basic burger right.  He knows his stuff!!!  The menu is pretty small.  Just burgers, but as Ramsay always says a good restaurant has a small menu because it's important to do a few things really well.  If you are a burger lover, it's a must visit when you are in Vegas.  We will definitely visit again when and if we return to Vegas!
I rarely rate places at five stars but this fun exciting place with top quality food at fair prices is superb. My best buddy, wife, and I had the onion rings Hell's Kitchen and Gordon burger.  They were excellent. Crispy and flavorful without the deep fryer flavor onion rings are definetly wonderful.  The Gordon burger with grid duck bacon and pork is second to none. The Hell's Kitchen burger with the grilled jalapeno has earthy beefy flavor with a bite.  We cook a lot at home and if we can cook it there better than the restaurant it will never get five stars from us. And Gordon has lived up to his rep with us. Highly recommend.  Will return.
Where to start.......... Staff was super friendly!!! Atmosphere was okay, nothing spectacular. Food was just so-so. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. This burger looked so goood! Took my first bite and was like "WTH" no taste! I thought, okay maybe it's just me, dining ad my bf try it. Nope! It was very bland, had no flavor. The staff was super nice and exchanged it for the Farm Burger, which I completely recommend. But you're gonna want to get it medium rare. Cook it anymore and it loses flavor. So 3 stars is all I give it.
Definitely not bad, though I'd say it doesn't place in the top 5 burgers I've ever had.. . I have to admit, I stopped here pretty much because of the name. While I do love a good burger, Gordon Ramsay's shows are also some of my favorite guilty pleasure TV. I mean, who doesn't like watching someone break into tears as they're screamed at for burning risotto?. . I opted for the Euro Burger and the truffle fries, as it sounded like they would make a good pairing. The presentation was quite nice and the food itself was a solid 3 stars. Pricing is what I'd expect for the location. In retrospect I wish I had gone with a different burger, as the Euro has such mild toppings that it really seemed a bit bland. To be fair, one of my co-workers went there the day before and had the Farm Burger, which he said was absolutely amazing. . . I'm glad I checked it out, but I don't feel terribly compelled to return, especially considering how many restaurants there are to choose from in that area.
Perhaps the best burger I have ever had. Chanterelle mushrooms + arugula + figgy-onion jam on a sesame seed bun. Never thought that a burger without mayo or cheese was a burger. I was so wrong. Not only yummy, but it feels like it is good for you.
My wife and I are true foodies. We live to eat as opposed to eat to live. We have experienced Petrus in London. a spectacular Gordon Ramsey dining experience. And although BurGR may seem a "burger joint" I can assure you it is an extension of GR's talent. His recognition of quality ingredients + perfect preparation = that memorable experience. Truly the best burg I have ever consumed.
$50 for two burgers and fries!?.. Really. Talk about over charging. Presentation was good. Food was ok, it was after all just a burger with an egg in it. That is the farm burger I got. The truffle fries came out a little soggy. The hell's kitchen burger had no taste at all. Just a neat party with jalapenos. Really. We paid $15 for a burger that had no flavor. Absolutely disappointed with this. . . Bottom line, would I go back?. . Only if you paid for it.. . I wouldn't waste my money here, in n out burger with light well fries own this place. . . Expensive place to throw away money, tries pretty hard to accommodate on a higher level but for the price it's a waste of money. . . Although their ice tea was pretty good.
Chef Gordon Ramsay, . . This is what I call perfection. Thank you.  We loved it, best burger we ever ate.
Good. Not great. Surely not worth hr wait if there's a line. . . Did not get a shake. Might have missed out there. . . Fries were average. Wish we would have tried onion rings. . . Reasonable pricing. . . Good beer selection.
Best part of our whole trip was eating here!! I've always wanted to eat at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant then I saw Christina was the exec chef I had to eat here. We even got the best seats in the house at the counter watching the chef. . . Garrett was our server and just made our experience so incredible! We even got the busy Christina to sign my menu - it was a great birthday! . . The hostess was really rude because we weren't silver club members or whatever but don't let her be the reason not to eat here, the place is amazing! My favorite item was the fury wings. Thank you Garrett and Christina for this unforgettable experience! Now if I can only time it next time to meet Gordon Ramsey!!
The only thing good about the meal was the onion rings.  The french fries where cold when they arrived and the dipping sauces were inedible.  Burger not cooked to desired "medium well".  If burgers are what your do, there really should not be any question about when they are done.  With the number of people they serve in a day they should have a well oiled machine, and they didn't.  Disappointed to say the least
The food was excellent, and the service was good with regard to her attentiveness. However, because we sat at the bar due to the line, I heard her moan and complain about every single thing. I know I'm in Vegas, but every other word shouldn't be a curse word or bashing of the managers and how they "chewed" her "ass" for not getting something signed, and she didn't "give a s*it"--about ten million times. I thought it was rude and inconsiderate to speak like that in front of customers. . . The chipotle ketchup was amazing, and the burger was delicious.
Came forthe burgers and the pretty boys.. . Was not disappointed.. . . (Fish and crisp sandwich was absolutely excellent and service was great)
Wonderful experience... great service and great food to top it off! Was willing to accommodate and substitute beef patty for chicken since I'm not a beef eater.
Burgr, simple right? But Gordon Ramsey takes it to a new level! . . Simple burgers with great ingredients and cooked to perfection!. . Had a big party in a rush and Megan took care of us! We told her ahead of time for split checks, so please tell your waiter/waitress right away- it a process you have to be patient with! Megan got our meals going on a busy night and she was awesome! . . I'm not sure what everyone else in the party ordered but a few friends got the new  Gordon Burgr, not on the menu yet but friends devoured it! . . The Jalapeno poppers are a must! And the dipping sauce was amazing! Best popper I've ever had, not too bready, it was just perfect! Unique presentation, great for sharing since each popper had its own glass with sauce in it. . . I was excited for the Parmesan Truffle fries,  they were tasty but I'm not a "steak cut" fry  person, I prefer the shoe string cut and crispier fry! Dipping sauces were on point!. . Now for my farm Burgr, lets just list a few adjectives: delicious, moist, fresh, amazing, simple, yummy! It's definitely a burger if come back for! . . So price wise, it is more on the expensive side for a burger but from what my friends all ate, they said it was worth it! So do i, i consider it a treat burger! There are two pricings listed, black and orange [like a dollar off]. Orange is for total rewards, so while you're waiting in line head over to the Total Rewards counter by PF changs to get a free card, must be 21&older. I say it was worth it cause we had added gratuity due to our large party. And if you get 3 items on your check, that's $3! It adds up.
This place is FUEGO !.   Easily the Best burger in the City.  I've eaten almost everything on the menu but really enjoy the Euro Burger.  Truffle aioli, goat cheese and warm tomato - BOOM !  Gordon also makes up a great shake but the Chocolate Hazelnut pudding, coffee, praline cookie is mind blowing.  If your UP any money THIS IS THE PLACE TO SPEND IT.
I honestly don't think it met basic minimum expectations, and I'm a huge fan of Chef Ramsay... . What went well, nothing at all.... . The long wait in the line, was expected, but didn't seem justified as there were several open tables and view.... . The flavors of the hell's burger and the Farm burger was good maybe if the food was warm enough... . The onion rings and the French fries were mediocre at best... The chili dog was good, but a little too spicy for me.. . Service? Really poor.. We sat at the bar, and the gentleman behind the bar like any sense of hospitality... You'd expect some sense of interaction with the people at the bar, but none of that... The kitchen? Not good at all.. Our order was confused three times, the appetizers did not come out first, the burgers did, the appetizers were delayed and when they serve the burgers afterwards they were already cold... The guys to my left hadsimilar problem with their food was confused with something else... So between taking a long time to deliver the food, not delivering the appetizers as expected, delivering the cold, the whole experience went downhill fast... Since this happened to the guys next to me to my left it seems like the kitchen was out of control... I would not recommend this
Farm burger, euro burger  and the trufle parmesan fries were so good. Service is the best. Alex, our server, made sure everything was alright. Scott, their manager, made sure we were getting the best service. My wife is not a fan of burgers but this is one of the burger places that I can enjoy a burger with her. Thanks.
I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay, I've seen every episode of every show he has done, even the little known ones overseas.  However, there is just a little something oft-putting about him having to stamp his name and image everywhere in his restaurants.  I mean, yeah we get it, this is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, we don't need to be reminded of it everywhere we turn our head. . . Ok had to just make that remark, but I gotta say this place is great, just amazing burgers, atmosphere, and staff.  I personally with my burgers enjoy fries that are more thin cut instead of the steak fries style he served, and this would be my only suggestion for improvement.  Otherwise for burgers, this place can't be beat.. . I suggest heading over to Gordon Ramsay steak for sticky toffee pudding for dessert if you have time, instead of the version at BurGR which is modified into push pops.
Best burger ever!!! I had the southern Yardbird  (chicken  burger). The flavors were perfect! The sweet potato  fries were awesome too. My blood orange cosmo was a great addition. We were seated at the bar and the bar staff was great. We had a 30 min wait but it was totally worth it.
$$$$$ Holly Bizzoly!! Expensive Elite!. . . 2 Steaks and 1 appetizer with 4-5 drinks was $270.00??? The food was great and one drink sucked, but that check I am still trying to figure out.. . When I do, I will come back and explain.. . To be continued...
When visiting in Vegas it really is difficult at times to find a decent place to eat without spending a couple 100 bucks. If you're looking for a good burger this is the place to come. You'll spend 13-17 dollars on a burger (with no side) but it really is tasty. You can tell that the ingredients are good quality and you don't feel greasy and fat afterwards. I got my burger togo and waited about 10 minutes, which isn't terrible. By looks they also had a good selection of beers on draft.
We had a great time.  I had hoped for a little better beer selection to go with the burgers, but I managed to find something I like.  I hadthe "Gordon Burger" which was on special and came with avocado and duck bacon.  It was quite good.  We ordered some sweet potato fries and some truffle fries.  The truffle fries could've been dialed back a notch, but they were good.  Sweet potato fries came with powdered sugar and some kind of non-descript Jello-pudding-looking sauce.  My wife had the Britannia burger, which she liked, though she did have to send it back to get the chutney that comes with it.  Sending back a dish at a Ramsay restaurant brought a smug satisfaction that money can't buy.  We all had a good laugh about it.  Our server was great, the food was great, the atmosphere was great.  The price was appropriate.
My husband and I both love burgers so thinking if you put them with a famous chef backing them it should be good.   My first thought was that the chairs are too low for the table.  My mouth was practically at table height so I didn't like that.   The restaurant is set up nicely and the fire decoration in front is cool.. . My second thought is that if you have your drink options on an IPad only and wifi isn't working then you have no drink menus.   This is exactly what happened so we had to keep tossing out beer names to our server to see if they had them.   Really annoying!. . I ordered a cheeseburger and specified I didn't want any pink when cooked.  My husband ordered the farm burger and wanted a little pink.   You guessed it, they. Mixed it up and I had pink.  Not sure if its a server issue or the kitchen. We also ordered the fries which come with two types of ketchup.   Overall, my burger was good.  The bun was fresh and the burger was a nice size.  My husband really like his.  The flavor of the egg really added a "Pop" to the sandwich.   The fries were disappointing.   No real flavor unless you dipped them in ketchup.. . Speaking of ketchup, the server dropped a container of ketchup and it splashed all over the man sitting next to us.   He had a nice Izod shirt on and it stained it terribly.    Couldn't believe they actually brought the guy a bill.    We were told he felt funny about them paying for his wife's salad, but we felt they shouldn't even have given him the option. Not cool, as I am sure the shirt is ruined.. . Glad we tried it, but not likely to hurry back.
This place had great service and the burger was great. The fries were a bit to seasoned ( gave all 9 of us a tummy ache) ordered chicken burger for the kids and was still too spicy. The smoke from the casino was very overwhelming. May return sans kids.
Excellent service, a bit pricey even considering the location but ultimately, the burgers fell a bit below high expectations (Farm Burger and Euro Burger). If you're familiar with the LA burger joints, here's a list of places with a clearly better burger (in no particular order):. . 1. Umami. 2. Tuning Fork. 3. Father's Office. 4. Pie N' Burger. 5. Local Peasant. . So after waiting 30 minutes to get a table and then waiting a bit too long for our burger to be delivered, along with a high bill, we left satisfied and happy we went... but a bit underwhelmed.
This is a laid back Gordon Ramsay outlet with excellent fare. The sandwiches were fantastic! The fries left a bit to be desired. If they were better this place would be an instant 5 out of 5. . . We ate at the bar which was enjoyable. The stools had backs which make it more palatable than many bar stools. The beer choices were ok with a few good craft choices. The price was excellent if you like good beer and bad if you like simple mainstream beer like Coors (all choices were the same price).. . This is definitely a spot I want to visit again in the future!
Just had the* coconut strawberry milkshake, fries, american burg and wings. Asked for well done and still got medium rare. The fries were fresh but not really prepared well. The milk shake mightt bethel best part until it is room temp and just tastes bad. Tried it as i am a fan of gordan but pretty disappponted.  I wont be back. Maybe the chef needs to be yelled at what is the diff between well done n medium rare.
This was everything I had hoped for and more!  Although my hubby would beg to differ, he ordered a fish sandwich at a burger place!  So he was disappointed, I, on the other hand, was not!  I ordered the Chanterelle burger YUM!  The atmosphere was great, service was expected for a popular Vegas place.  We started with onion rings...a must order!  We will visit again!
It was OK... the burger was good but not spectacular.  The space was modern and inviting but overall it didn't match they hype.  Not a bad experience but not particularly memorable.
I think the 4 star is pretty justifiable for this restaurant. . . The hamburgers are great. It definitely has some twist from your regular burgers. Each burger has something special to it. My first time here, I tried the Euro burger and Farm burger. I know a lot of people love the farm burger, but for me personally it was a little too heavy. I prefer to have some vegetables in my burger as well. Euro burger for me was a better balanced burger. The second time at this place, I tried the Euro Burger and Hell Kitchen's burger. Hell Kitchen definitely has a fusion-ey taste to it. It was really good as well. . . BUT IT IS THE PARMESAN FRIES THAT WERE SO SO SO GOOD. You have to try these fries. The oreo shake was really good as well if you have the stomach for extra sugar. The food overall is definitely something you should try if you like burgers. . . The only downside is the long long wait. Last time I was there it was an hour and half wait so be prepared. Just don't go over when you are super hungry expecting to be seated right away because it won't happen. . . In short,. 4.5-5 stars for the food and 3.5 stars for the service and the long wait.
Exxxxpensive! Yes, it's Gordon Ramsay and all, but $103 for 3 burgers, 1 fish & chip sandwich, 1 order of fries, 3 soft drinks and 1 beer is ridiculous. My family and especially my two sons are big fans of GR, but he's awfully proud of his prices. He must have Vegas confused with London, because he's charging in Pounds, and I'm not talking weight. . . The burgers were tasty and my son's fish & chip sandwich was a hoot - it's a full piece of fish served in what I would call Sizzler's finest Texas toast. The fries come with a curry ketchup and BBQ ketchup - both are great. The wait staff are terrific, especially the guy with the 12" tall Mohawk. I can't remember his name, but he took pictures with us and was genuinely a nice guy. . . Other than the price, the only thing I can complain about is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT!
VERDICT: A very juicy burger served as dryly as possible that makes you question the very nature of existence in the ambiance of a hospital cafeteria in hell.. . This is Gordon Ramsey's burger joint in Planet Hollywood in Vegas.  I don't usually review Strip restaurants, because it is usually overpriced tourist trap fare.  I figure that BurGR would provide, at the very least, a unique burger experience.  I had cousins visiting to watch a hockey game and was given the parameters that they wanted a burger or steak.  It was a perfect opportunity to try BurGR.. . First, you are greeted with an artistic wall of fire where you wait to be seated.  Nothing is more welcoming after being in the 115 degree summer heat than a nice hot furnace to stand by.  I guess this is some sort of German existential performance art piece.  You get to experience the horror of Hell's Kitchen.  The pain, the suffering, the agony I suppose only add to the culinary experience.  You must suffer before you know pleasure.  Make sure to be seated in the "No Exit" section for a full sensory experience.. . The service was excellent.  I would describe the decor as"newly decorated hospital cafeteria in the seventies".  Which I think is in vogue?  I don't know.  Of course, there are televisions broadcasting all the latest in sports, because the world caters to sports lovers and sports are one of two things you'll ever see on televisions in restaurants.  The only other thing being, of course, menus.. . The burgers did take a while, but that was to be expected.  One of my cousins ordered a plain burger with nothing on it, which leads me to believe that he gets the whole German existential culinary experience better than I do.  I got a burger with fancy cheeses on  it.  We also split two orders of fries.  So, 4 burgers, two fries, and three sodas came to over $90.. . I have a hard time describing the burger, because it was both good and bad...like life.  This would be ideal if I was taking a course in philosophy, but I wanted an all over good burger, not one sprinkled with the bitter disappointments of a life spent in agonizing self-contemplation.  The meat portion was perfection.  I truly have not had a burger patty done to such high standards ever before.  The bun, however, was dry.  I don't mean just without condiments, I mean dry like it had built-in desiccant.  Any juiciness of the burger was offset by the moisture destroying sponges on the top and bottom.  My saliva was not enough.  I found I needed to down food with water.. . The fries were unexceptional.  The garlic Parmesan fries did little in the way of flavor.  They were basically a regular order of fries with a sprinkle of Parmesan and garlic on the top, definitely not worth the extra money.  The fries came with different condiments, one of which was curry ketchup, a staple in many European countries and a condiment that just can't seem to make it in the United States.. . I'm mixed as to whether to recommend this restaurant or not.  I feel it's great if you want an expensive total sensory German existential philosophy adventure making you see through the veil-covered illusion that is life.  Or if you got the money, try it once.
