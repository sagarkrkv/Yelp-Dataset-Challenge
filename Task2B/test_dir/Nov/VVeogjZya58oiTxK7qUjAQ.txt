I think that this place is great! The first time I've been here and the service was amazing as well as the food. The staff is super friendly and attentive and the food is fresh and delicious. Couldn't have been a better experience.
The pizza is amazing. I would have to say the best pizza in town. The wait very long but I would say worth the wait. Can't wait to go back.
I came here about a month and a half ago for my birthday with a friend and I had a wonderful time. Our server, Tammy, was absolutely amazing! I've never been here before so she suggested many things for us to try, as well as making us feel like VIP customers. . . We had the MARGHERITA pizza with sliced salami on top to give it that pepperoni pizza feel. The pizza was cooked perfectly, the iced tea was delicious, and they served Coca Cola in bottles, the only way to had soda! . . The wait for the food is long, but worth the wait. The location is a bit small, so it gets very cramped when it gets busy.
Since we were in Phoenix for an entire week, we asked around for lots of restaurant recommendations.  Pizzeria Bianco was mentioned quite often.  Some said it was the best pizza in Phoenix, while others said they were known nationally for their pizza.  Since we were only a few blocks away, we headed over on a Saturday night to check it out. . . The first thing you notice when you get there is how small the location is.  It's an old house that's been converted into a restaurant.  There are approximately 12 tables, along with bar seating for an additional 10 people or so.  Since it was a Saturday night, the wait time was 30-45 minutes.  . . You have the option of waiting outside at the picnic tables next to the restaurant, but seeing how Phoenix is in the middle of a desert that's not a great option during the summer.  What is a great option is walking next-door to Bar Bianco.  It's also an old house that's been converted, but this time into a bar and lounge area.  It makes for the perfect spot to have an adult beverage and relax while you wait for your table.  And the system they have in place is stress-free.  When your table is ready, the hostess calls over to the bartender to let them know.  Easy as can be.. . We ended up sitting at the bar, which worked out great because the bartender shared lots of information about the restaurant with us.  Bianco is known for their artisanal pizza, in the certified Neapolitan style.  We ordered three pizzas as well as an appetizer, so we could try a little bit of everything.. . First up was the appetizer of Spiedini, which consisted of Fontina cheese wrapped in prosciutto, served warm over a bed of greens (spinach, I believe).  Warmed Italian meat and cheese? Yes, please!  Next up were the pizzas; Margherita, Sonny Boy, and Wiseguy.  All of the pizzas are cooked in the wood-fired oven, giving the thin crust a delicious crispness.  The Margherita was delicious in its simplicity of tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil.  The Wiseguy had sausage and the most amazing caramelized onions I've ever tasted, thick sliced and full of seasoning.  These are the kind of onions you would expect to be served as a side dish at a high-end steakhouse.  But my favorite pizza of the night was the Sonny Boy.  I loved the sodium-laden combination of salami and kalamata olives.  It may be too salty for some, but I thought it was perfect.. . Although the Sonny Boy was my favorite, the other two weren't far behind.  It's a very simplistic menu, with only a few preset options of pizza.  But everything we tried was awesome, and the reputation for being the best pizza in Phoenix appears to be well earned.
Good but overhyped pizza; small place so often have to wait for a while to get a table. Great atmosphere.
Best pizza this side of Napoli.   Just the right sauce and cheese.  Perfect wood oven crust.   Excellent starters. What else can I say !!!
They've got it figured out!
I don't understand the hype...AT ALL. The ingredients are fresh but the pizza sauce is bland....no flavor! The bread they served before the meal was cold and just nothing special. The salad we ordered was spring greens with vinaigrette dressing....I could make it at home. Service was great BUT other than that I can't understand why so many people were waiting in line to spend $20 on a blase pizza and salad. I don't see myself ever going back. Save your time and money... go to Spinatos for far better pizza or Nellos for better salad.
this pizza is life chagning!
OMG now I finally know why everyone is always talking about this place!  The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is awesome, and the location is amazing!  Definetley a placeeveryone needs to try at least once :-)
The only time I've ever enjoyed olives.
Rated one of the top pizza places in the US but we were NOT impressed at all!! Such a disappointment...my parents came from Delaware to visit me and my dad was so excited to try pizza bianco...4 pizzas and 4 waters later with horrible service we left with a $89 tab!! The server was a nice gentleman but over all experience was disappointing!
Love it! Them tomatoes!
Pizza is wonderful if pricey.  Hard to go wrong, you just have to pay for it.
The pizza was delish, the service was nice,the cooks were efficient. No complaints, only compliments! :)
Every time I come to Pizzeria Bianco it is a great experience. On most occasions there is a wait when I visit, but they even make the waiting pleasant with Bar Bianco right next door. We never have to worry whether they are going to miss us, as they have a very organized system and always let you know when your table is ready. The restaurant is small, warm, and cozy. The wait staff is super friendly. Here, simplicity is key. They are never over the top. There is a waiter who I believe is named Horacio who is very helpful and friendly. Pizzeria Blanco has contributed to some great memories and I will always go back knowing that I will have a great dining experience.
Very dissapointed.  Heard a lot about this place and went there on an appetite, only to be very dissapointed.  By far the thinnest pizza I've ever seen.  I don't even think they provide toppings for their pizza.  Most of the pizza was just sauce with a little bit of cheese.  Quality wasn't even that good.  I don't know maybe this just isn't my type of pizza because it is definetely a style of its own.  . . All the other reviews are good so maybe I am just used to traditional American pizza places, but I am glad I did not bring someone from out of town here with me because I would have been embarassed.. . I easily ate the entire Marghertta pizza on my own $15.  When I pay that much I expect to have leftovers.  I would definetely recommend Oregano's, Barros, or Little Chicago's pizza over this place.
This place has somehow achieved cult status in Phoenix,  but I just don't see the draw.  I like a fired crust,  but the crust here was so blackened it was like eating burnt toast.  Not good. The fennel sausage tasted like,  well fennel,  and not much else.  It's like they said "hey,  let's take the worst flavor in sausage and make it the star!" So the food is certainly overrated,  but there are other problems here as well. Namely,  parking.  They have one tiny lot that depending on when you go may or may not be valet only.  Since there was no other option,  we used the valet. Three dollars to watch him park our car literally fifteen feet from where we stopped. Bizzare. And then there are your fellow diners. Lots of Ed Hardy wearing dudebros when we were there. Not really our scene.  I don't think we will be back here considering there are so many better pizza joints in the valley.
As an avid pizza maker myself, I looked forward to visiting Pizzeria Bianco for the first time.     . . I was fortunate enough to be in town on a Monday for lunch, so I did not experience the legendary long wait times.  I was able to get a seat at the bar immediately.  I ordered the Sonny Boy pizza, which is analogous to an upscale pepperoni pizza.  It had tomato sauce, their house made mozzarella, sopressata (spicy Italian salami) and some fancy olives.  . . Getting the crust right is the first order of business for a great pizza place and Bianco does not disappoint.  It was baked to perfection.  The crust was stretched thin.  The rim (cornicone) was puffed up just the right amount and the underside had the perfect amount of charring; not burned, just baked correctly.  There was no "gum line" to be found anywhere in the crust and the end of the pizza droops just the right amount.  The crust wasn't a cardboard biscuit, nor was it floppy/soupy.  It had the right amount of structure and chew.  . . You really know that you've eaten a great pizza when it begins to taste even better as you approach the end of the pizza.. . As much as I'm gushing over the crust, I will say that I've come to prefer the flavor of naturally leavened dough (sourdough) for pizza.  I think that the crust could be even better if he made the move to natural leavening, but that's just my preference.. . The sopressata was spicy, but not overly so, not was it too salty.  The sauce was simple and tasty and I'm in love with their cheese.. . Looking at the food on the tables of other patrons it's apparent that their produce is among the most beautiful I've ever laid eyes on.  I've never seen tomatoes that red or arugula that green, etc.  . . Is this the best pizzeria in the country?  It is uncommonly excellent, but I have had pizzas elsewhere that were every bit as good.
Finally got to eat at Pizzeria Bianco, well worth it!. . Customer service was great and service was fast.. . Cute spot and awesome area of town.. . Pizza, (which they will split for You if You want to try 2 types) top notch Rustic Style, Minimal pies but very balanced and Tasty. Salad and other options are meek but good quality.. . The only reason it's 4 stars is it's over-priced and not too many options, but I love and respect what they are doing. More of a destination location then a stop by Pizza joint.
Great location and storefront. Very warm, inviting feeling when you get there. Usually quite a wait to get a table so make sure you call ahead or are ok with waiting for at least an hour or so.  Sometimes you can find a spot without much wait after 9.. . I don't know if it's the best pizza in the country, but then again, don't know that it isn't.  It's 18 for a pizza and they have really interesting flavors. the crust is obviously delicious and great consistency. I think my favorite is just the classic margerita.. . I'll return
Tasty pizza. The crust has a nice chew to it. Hubby and I got a Wiseguy and Sonny Boy to share. Both pizzas came with generous portions of protein! More than I expected, that rarely happens! Both were $18 each. Wait was 30 minutes for a late lunch. We waited at the bar in the little house next door to the restaurant. Got a couple of beers and got a table at the Pizzeria before we even had a chance to finish our drinks. Valet parking for $3 in the adjacent lot. Service was fantastic! Super friendly with a smile. Glad I can finally check this place off my list!
The pizza here is wonderfully tasty. The wait is usually long, so prepare yourself. It's a very small place, not ideal for large groups.
Love, love, love this place!!!! As good of pizza as you can possibly get. I have eaten pizza all over the U.S. and Italy and this is better than anything else I have ever had.. . I highly recommend this place. I think the only issue I had with it was the wait. Still gave it 5 stars; even though I waited 2 hours to get in.. . If you are in Phoenix, this is a MUST GO!!!!
