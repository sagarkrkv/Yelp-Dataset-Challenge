The final food stop on our Vegas adventure!. . My cousin and I wanted to get a quick bite to eat before heading to a show. We just happened to walk by BLT Burger. We took a quick glimpse at the menu in front entrance. Since time wasn't on our side, we decided to dine here. . . We found some seats near the bar area since seating at the tables were scares. Our bartender/server hand us our menus. I was already decided on what to order, but wanted to check out the drinks offered here. I opted out on alcohol this time since we had to be up early the next morning. I order the cream soda, since I've haven't had it in a very long time. It must have been a popular drink since I ordered the last bottle in the restaurant. The soda was clear and crisp. It had a gentle taste of vanilla. For my main course, I went the the kobe slider trio. I wasn't really hungry, but could be satisfied with this small burgers. . . The slider trio came with slider flavors consisting of BLT, BBQ Onion, and Blue Cheese. The kobe patties were tender and juicy in all three sliders. The bacon, lettuce, onions were crispy and crunchy.. . A little steep on the pricing, but was expecting to pay a little more since we were in Vegas. Service was excellent!
We went to BLT Burger after a quick google search, which listed this place on a Forbes "12 Great Las Vegas Restaurants For Every Taste & Budget" list. So we figured, hey, this place is gonna be pretty great! WRONG! The most I can say about this place is that the sweet potato fries were half decent (there again still not the best I've had). I had the BLT burger and my husband had the route 80 burger (not even sure if that's what it was called) but both burgers seemed to be frozen patties that you would get at a fast food place. Very surprising for a restaurant inside a hotel on the strip in Vegas. We were both hoping for a fresh, juicy handcrafted burger, but that's not what we got. And to top it all off, our check was $70 for two burgers, one order of fries, a beer and a milkshake...what a rip off! Find somewhere else to spend your money.
My friend and I were visiting the Mirage for an evening show.  We wanted to grab a bite to eat beforehand and a burger sounded good.  . . We were greeted and seated immediately.  The dining area was clean but the speakers for the tvs were very loud.  I realize we were in the casino so I let it go.   Our waitress did an amazing job.  She was friendly and very attentive.   A good tip for her indeed! . . I decided to try the Cowboy.   The burger was topped with bbq chipotle, onions, bacon and pepper jack.   This burger was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor.  I ordered the sweet potato fries on the side.  This was the first place that I didn't enjoy them.  It was almost an overdone consistency yet not burned.  Just a weird flavor overall.  . . I usually don't complain about the cost of my meals but I have to say something.  2 people, 2 burgers & fries with water = 45.   Hmmm. The burger was good but not worth going back.  I would recommend a different place if you must eat in the Mirage.
3.5 stars. . Located right at the entrance to the Mirage by the fountains across from Harrah's.. . Fairly priced for a Strip Hotel joint.  There is a big selection of burgers and shakes.  Not a bad stop for relatively inexpensive meals.
Our MUST STOP restaurant every time we hit vegas! The chilli is incomparable! That's seriously all I order it's so hearty and thick a cup is all you need!
3.5 stars.. . The burger was pretty tender and cooked medium, but lacked any real flavor. The onion rings were a bit too sweet to have that I-want-eat-more-of-it draw. Lastly, the pickle tasted like a raw cucumber rather than something that was pickled.
This review is based on our visit tonight. The Ceasar salad was wilted and the croutons were soggy and lacked flavor. We had to return the bowl of chili, it was loaded with CORN. We ate here in August and there was no corn in it. The food server said he would talk it off our bill, he did not offer to get us something else. I noticed another party was returning their burger. He had told the food server to make it well done, which it wasn't. We observed our food server tell the manager about our chili, but never did the manager come to our table to apologize. Unacceptable! Earlier in the afternoon we did have a shake to go. Their shakes are yummy!  Strawberry a little runny, chocolate rich and thick.
