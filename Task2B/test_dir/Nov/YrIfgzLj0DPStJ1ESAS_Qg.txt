First, I've never seen so much wasted food packaging in my life! I'm smiling when saying that humorously, but it's true!!! Styrofoam cups. Styrofoam bowls. Plastic bags. Paper napkins. Plastic table cloth. . . Things to note- if you just got your nails did and are craving your seafood boil fix, never fear. Ask for plastic gloves. My mom brings her own dishwashing gloves to crawfish boils, but they will provide you some plastic ones upon request. . . Took Yelper advice and got half a pound of shrimp. Shrimp were slightly overcooked. After you peel it, dunk it around in the sauce so it can get more flavor on it! Sauces are nice. . . We also got the fried cajun calamari, and it's really not good... just generic fried frozen calamari that is overly tough. Don't get that.. . Crawfish itself is not in season now, so expectation management is always important. They will likely inform you that it is frozen. A pound of it won't get you very far though.  . . Some of the girls working there will tell you "mild" is actually "medium" for most people, but I would disagree. Mild tastes like "mild" with just a minor punch to it.. . Service was great. The girls working were all very sweet and nice.. . For calamari, half a pound of shrimp, a pound of crawfish, a half order of sausage, two potatoes, and a Diet Coke, our total was $33 before tip. It's not exactly cheap for frozen seafood. A fun experience for locals that have no where else to turn for a seafood boil, but a little on the price-heavy side.
Damn good!!!  Just moved to town.  My coworkers recommended the place.  We will be back.  I ordered 2lbs of Crawfish, the wife ordered 2 pounds of Shrimp.  Next time we will order 1lb each of Shrimp, Crawfish, and a Crableg.  Hot N Juicy Seasoning of course!!
This location is a bit difficult haha but it's in the same plaza as Bambu.. . It's usually crowded to be prepared to wait but wait usually isn't that long.. . Bun opt for crab legs while I got the shrimp, I believe my shrimp was about uh... $12 or $14 per lb. We also got their cajun fries and oo they were yum. but over time, it did get salty but if I remember correctly, these fries had more of a cajun taste while boiling crab (my next review!) was more of a kick spicy taste, however Bun says the exact opposite and he's more sensitive to spicy.. . Soda beverages were $1.25 with free refills. Sad that they got my flavor wrong but were willing to change it kindly. Tbh I couldn't taste to much of a difference in terms of taste between this and Boiling Crab haha. . Total bill was about $40 with tip. . . Will be back!
When I goto Vegas for work the first place I also go first is Hot & Juicy Crawfish!! The Original sauce is the best, I usually have crab, shrimp and crawfish. Don't forget to add the incredible sausage and corn. The food is very messy and fun. Expect to taste  and smell garlic for the next 24 hours!!
We had lunch here at hot n juicy before we left vegas and its was delicious. I recommend it if u want great service ,good food and good price. The restaurant was very clean n the staff are very friendly.
I hate seafood but love this place. The shrimp in the hot sauce is amazing. The lobster is so delicate. This place really had the idea perfectly modeled.
Seems like every time I come here the services is get worse.. And it wasn't even busy this time.. I love this place,, but this time even the food was affected.. I'm daughter and I got a pound of shrimp and it wasn't even cooked all the way.... I don't know what's happening to this place.. It used to be the best in Vegas..
Oh my gosh!! This place was hands down amazing!!!! We came here for the first time tonight and this will be a stop for us from now on every time we visit vegas! Our server Andrea and Selina were great! They suggested the snow crap legs which were to die for!! We liked it so much we ordered a second pound! We got the hot and juicy mix medium.  Our server Andrea suggested medium because it gets spicy as you keep eating. Her suggestion was spot on! Thank you Andrea! We ended up ordering 2 pounds of snow crab and 1 pound of shrimp!  So good! Both servers were very nice and attentive! Great place to visit! You will be hooked!!
Just taking my own personal time writing this review about Hot N Juicy makes me want to drive over there right now and get a pound of shrimp. This place is king in terms of asian/creole style crawfish/shrimp/prawns. I think the shrimp is the better than the crawfish. The hot n juicy special sauce- spicy-  is the best tasting style imo. Id recommend requesting the potatoes and putting them inside the bag. The only negative things id say about this place is that dinner can be very messy and that your hands will smell, sometimes days after you eat. Crab legs are above average, corn is sweet, and prices are reasonable.
I hate HATE crawfish!  But it's messy filthy fun date.  You're offered a bib and U get pounds of crap thrown on ur table andjust get messy!  If u like crawfish GOGOGO MUST GO!  I just hate u can see the feces that you are eating!  Barf Out!
