Our $45.98 Groupon for "two dinner buffets with unlimited drinks" expired a few weeks ago but we used the paid value of it towards our meal. We bought the Groupon months ago with the intention to use it that day, but when we arrived there was a line all the way through the regular turnstile, up the escalator, and nearly out the door to the Miracle Mile Shops. We avoided this buffet for months, thinking it was this crowded all the time. We went Halloween night and there was NO ONE in line. I was told this was a "slow" season.. . We are Total Rewards (players card) members and expected to pay $27.99 each, minus the Groupon credit. However, the "NEW PRICING" prices noted on the website menu http://bit.ly/1u7By0S were not the actual prices. The cashier said the prices increased, and in fact they increased a few hours before we arrived. Our new price for Total Rewards members was $29.99 plus tax. That was a bit disappointing, and we suggested they update the website immediately.. . Total of $77.76 for buffet for two wasn't a great value overall (we get free buffets often at Silverton, The M, and Stations Casinos), but I suppose our fault for buying the Groupon not knowing the lines would be so long at the time we wanted to be there in the first place.. . Service was good. Food selection was all good and tasty except for the baklava which was stiff. The chardonnay house wine was very cheap and sugary in my opinion. I would not do the all-you-can-drink next time. Better to buy a quality glass of wine in the casino and bring it in.. . There was a photographer taking those "tourist" photos and trying to sell a pair of pics for $20. We didn't care for that, and we didn't appreciate that she assumed we were tourists. Locals like us are just as much of the clientele around this town.. . If the price was lower and if they'd upgrade the house wine selection, we'd go again.
The food here was ok, pretty typical buffet place. The prime rib was good though and they had a wide selection of foods.. . The desserts looked pretty good but i was a little disgusted when a roach crawled on my arm while i was eating my last plate that i just stopped eating and left.
Visited late afternoon, and most of the food seemed like it was sitting for a while.  It took a while before anyone told me I had to ask the server to bring steamed crab legs rather than get them on ice. Too bad the server only came around every 15 minutes so I had to wait for my warm crab.  Nothing spectacular food wise, but they do have cotton candy for dessert.
I wouldn't give it 2*s if they wouldn't have crab legs and a decent waitress. The food....skip it....the whole place has a hometown buffet energy to it...just sad....even the smell is akward.  Why would u put a restaurant in the basement area??? Smh....
Overall pretty good experience. The line was long, but they moved through it fairly quickly. Waitress was extremely nice and on point. I tried a bit of everything and everything was pretty good the best section by far is the Middle Eastern.. Eat the lamb kabobs and baba!
This buffet is a very poor value for the high costs.  My wife & I were very disappointed with the quality of both their food and service.  There are many other options available for your buck.
This buffet is one of the average buffets in las vegas. The selection is decent but not spectacular . I was disappointed with the dessert options especially after experiencing the amazing desserts at the paris buffet. Personally I liked the convenience of going to the V theater show and eating here right after. I purchased the buffet of buffet deal and I personally wouldn't go back to this buffet unless I had this deal.
Ready nice buffet. Everything was fresh abd looked good too.  Pineapple curry tilapia, bbq ribs, flank steak, three cheese lasagna all stand outs.  Some interesting choices as well apricot ham, Mac and cheeses balls, pork baroca burritos all good to. But I spent my extra stomach space on dessert. ... cupcakes to die for! Strawberry shirt cake and mint chocolate chip were best.  Really I ate $21 worth.   They also have crepe bar to make what you want, how you want it.  For lunch it's going to be enough to fill me up thru dinner.
