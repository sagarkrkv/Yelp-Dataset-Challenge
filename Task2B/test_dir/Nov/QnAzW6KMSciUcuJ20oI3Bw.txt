I have eaten lunch here before and enjoyed it very much. This is the first time I had breakfast and we were all very disappointed. I had the Belgium waffle w 2 sausage links added 2 eggs scrambled and a fountain drink. $15 for everything.  Something was added to my eggs that gave it a different taste and texture that I did not enjoy. 2 different types of pancakes were ordered, the buttermilk were the only ones anyone liked. My son in law had an omelette that he could not eat because of a funky taste. My waffle should have cooked for another minute or two.
I have a weird love-hate relationship with this place. I love the food, but I hate the atmosphere and theme that screams "Down-home farm fresh food that your middle-upper class family will adore" or in other words, "Our food is down to earth but our prices are not"... or "A slice of rural America, but pumped into a desert for the wealthy to enjoy." I think you get my point. . . Regardless the food is still incredible. The burgers are delicious, everything tastes fresh, and the portions are massive. Some of the best onion rings I have ever had.. . Back to the infuriating atmosphere. They were on that Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and show and will not hesitate to tell you at every opportunity. I challenge you to find a 10 sq. ft area anywhere in the restaurant that doesn't mention it somewhere. I don't understand since it isn't any of those things. It's an upscale hipster eatery with a splash of retro design. It's new, expensive, and insanely busy. It's basically like a food truck lost its wheels in the middle of a patch of non-native flora. . . Still I know it seems like a lot of complaining for a 4- star review, but the food is REALLY good. It's worth standing in a 20 minute line with people you would make fun of at a little-league game.
The food here is always great and the grounds are so peaceful and really enjoyable! The only issue I have about this place is 1. The dining room smells like a locker room "time for a carpet shampoo" and 2. For an "organic" restaurant they sure use an awful lot of plastic! Plastic cups,knives,forks, condiment cups and plates! Your carbon footprint is horrible!
So, I do love this place.  I can't seem to branch away from the fried zukes and Fontina burger (the pecan pesto is to die for)  but once and a while I will be swayed into getting the BBQ chicken pizza or the thai chicken salad.  My only gripes are that sometimes the line is ridiculously long..so go on off peak meal hours and whenever I go there for dinner children are always running around like a bunch of wild banshees (maybe their parents tricked them into thinking this was a chucky cheese)..
Loved this place, even got to bring my dog!. I had a lamb burger and sweet potato fries! It was delicious!
I have beenhere a couple of times now and I absolutely love the atmosphere and I love the concept.  However, I have yet to try any food that wows me.  We went in September and had a couple of their specialty hotdogs.  They were okay but nothing special.  We've also tried their burgers...again, good but not near the best I've ever had.  Maybe next time I'll try the bbq chicken pizza.
I love Joe's Farm Grill. The location and ambiance is so great with it being on a produce farm, and although I haven't tried the onsite Cafe, I know it has rave reviews as well. The menu at Joe's has a great assortment of really tasty food and the breakfast and lunch items I've tried (breakfast tacos, huevos, bbq chicken pizza, chicken sandwich, just to name a few) have never disappointed. . . The one downfall is that because there is the indoor-outdoor setup where people are constantly bustling in and out and leaving doors open, there tends to be quite a few flies inside at certain times of the year. Not unbearable, but a little annoying.. . All in all, it's a great place to take family and friends, especially out-of-towners, and is very child-friendly.
Good food good service and they do a lot for the community, if you enjoy eating here also try Joe's Barbeque. Same owner
We live in the west suburbs of Phoenix but try to hit up Joe's any chance we get. Great atmosphere with kids, delicious burgers, kids always eat every last bite, mud sundae is a great end to this pit stop. I usually split my meal, it's a lot of food.
Have had breakfast, lunch and dinner here multiple times. Never been disappointed. I usually get the Ahi Tuna sandwich for lunch and dinner at times and Joes big breakfast for breakfast. Both are good. Look forward to trying more on the menu. It's a great atmosphere for families. Enjoy!
Best burger I've ever had. I didn't even put sauce on it because of how good all of it was! Wasn't greasy, fresh produce, and excellent pesto. I think it was called the Fontina Burger. I also love the outdoor eating environment and their hanging lights. Next time we are definitely trying some of their milkshakes.
I do not usually give 5 stars. I tried to stay away from giving place is five stars so that when I do people know it's worth it. THIS PLACE DESERVES IT. . . This is my first time going to a farm-to-table restaurant. I was very happy that there was a walking area to view the farm. It could be turned into something extremely romantic, although I was more interested in the agriculture myself.. . There was outdoor seating as well as indoor seating, but the outdoor seating was by far the best. You're able to sit in a very lush green area while enjoying your food. This is most definitely a luxury in southern Arizona. . . I can only speak on behalf of the breakfast foods. So for the breakfast foods they were absolutely amazing. I had some eggs as well as a Belgian waffle, and I have not had a Belgian waffle that good since my visit to Europe. The environment could have had an influence on how good the waffle tasted, but isn't that the point?. . I will most definitely be returning to this place whenever I'm in the Mesa/Gilbert area. This is definitely an experience that you shouldn't miss out on and it's probably best for groups.
Yummy yummy yummy!. This place is just an absolutely awesome place for breakfast!  My friend had the Green Eggs and Ham and I was jealous over my perfectly cooked Belgian Waffle with fruit. The ambience is amazing ; you sit outside next to the beautiful garden where the spices and veggies are growing.  Another Triple D find right in my neighborhood!  I'll be going again and again!
Great food and a welcoming atmosphere. The portions are big, enough to take home left overs. I recommend their onion rings and sweet potato fries. Their burgers are huge, but I'm not complaining  . . The only down fall are the flies that roam around the restaurant. The company really needs to control that problem because getting them away takes a lot of work and ruins the dinner for most people.
Great selection of fan favorite foods. The milk shakes are thick and rich. The line can get long during the dinner rush, but I think that is a testament to the quality. Good things are worth the wait. I enjoyed the BBQ pulled pork.
