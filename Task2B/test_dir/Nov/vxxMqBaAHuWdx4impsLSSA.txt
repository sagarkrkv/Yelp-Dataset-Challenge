One of my favorites when I'm in Vegas! Reasons: Large selections like my favorite ox tails (mainly come for those!) and Manhattan clam chowder (one of the best I have had where they put LOTS of clams in there too!), good quality, good selections of desserts + gelato + a barista who can make lattes for you!! To all the sweet tooth and coffee people you would love that! Nothing is better than a nice cup of latte and not some plain coffee after a nice big meal!! Forgot to mention all you can drink beer on tap, wine and champagne...even better!! So there is something for everyone!! . . If you go during weekdays for lunch its only $15.99!!  If you go during dinner on the weekends, main difference is crab legs, a little more sashimi options, and a few other seafood items (oysters,mussels,lobster bisque soup). If you dont care too much for seafood....than its better to go during lunch time and pay almost half the cost.
One of the best buffets in Las Vegas.  Prime rib and crab legs are a must. Great food!
Been here twice this week. Great quality and food selection. Clean and good ambiance. Love the crab legs and fresh oysters. Yum! Highly recommended.
I have dined here several times when I'm really hungry.   It has been at various times of the day to experience the different menus.  . . Getting in line, paying and being seated can be a little bothersome.  This process shouldn't take long but at times it's like watching paint dry.  One of my visits went quick so I guess it depends on who is working.  . . The waitstaff I've had have been good.  Initially they have all brought drinks right away.  Sometimes they take longer to come back and check on the table but recently they've been better about it.  . . The buffet here is better than many of the other local casino buffets. I feel the variety is good for any palette type.  The empty bins are replaced fairly quickly.  The desserts are also good with a big gelato selection, sugar free desserts and coffee bar.   . . I do enjoy this buffet and many of our out of town guests love it.
California residents get $5 off if you show ID.  Yes!. . The line wasn't that long.  It was about a 10-15 minute wait around 1pm on a Sunday.  Too bad I was driving.  I would've drank some wine.  Anyway, my friend and I hit up every section at the buffet.  Some of the meats were good, others were dry, the sushi wasn't that great, nor was the orange chicken.  I loved the seafood.  I ate a lot of that.  Some of the rice were good, others not so much.  The fries weren't that great, the pizza was okay.  The mashed potatoes and meatballs were delicious.  Some of the salads were pretty good also.  Overall, I was satisfied.  I was stuffed to the max.  This buffet has pretty much everything.  The dessert section was pretty broad.  The gelato was the best thing there.  This buffet is not the greatest, but it will fulfill some of your taste buds.  . . We had an amazing waitress.  She always came around every time we needed something.
Seafood buffet in Vegas with beer/wine/champagne included? SCORE!. . I've been to this buffet twice (luckily when there wasn't too long of a wait time) and it didn't disappoint. Yes, the star of the show is the extensive seafood collection, including endless crab legs and fresh oysters. But their soups are also delicious - who doesn't love clam chowder with lots of clams in every spoonful? I also loved their tempura shrimp and prime rib. What I didn't enjoy from the entree section was their sushi and Kalbi short ribs - the sushi fish wasn't very fresh and the short ribs were sitting out for awhile, so they were grisly and tough to chew. What is most impressive is their dessert selection, with a multitude of delicious mini-desserts (I ate 2 creme brulees), gelato ice cream and a full service espresso/coffee bar! It was an awesome way to fulfill a sweet tooth craving without feeling stuffed after the huge buffet.. . I should also mention California residents get $5 off with ID - interesting concept since we're in Vegas, but I'm not complaining! Though it's off the Strip, if you can find a ride there, it's worth it!
ThisBuffet Used To Be Great, But It Has Gone Horribly South. Staff Had Gotten Ruder, Food Had Gotten Worse & They Don't Serve Breakfast Foods Anymore?! What's Up With That? Don't Go To This Buffet Until They Change It Back! I Know We Won't!!
For the price, this place isn't bad.  Came here on a Sunday night with our CA driver's licenses to get $5 off.  There was surprisingly no wait for our party of 7, possible because of the fact that it was a Sunday and the Rock and Roll marathon was taking place.  There is a good variety of food- salads, pizza, asian, soups, prime rib and of course seafood.  Desserts also had a good variety.. . Service was variable throughout the night.  Despite it not being too busy, we found that we would be out of drinks and our plates would be stacking up pretty fast.
This place is amazing. Service is great, the place is super clean, the food is really good, and the desserts are to kill for. Honestly nothing more to say.
Not impressed.. . I've heard so many people rave about this buffet, so I guess my standards were set a bit too high for this buffet.  I waited like a good girl in the super long line, looking forward to the delicious I had been told would be well worth it.. . Worth it?  Meh.. . The food seemed like just regular buffet food.  The oysters were not good (not fresh or something to that effect because I could barely eat one).  Now I understand that it's a buffet, but I expected better.  After going one round and trying different foods that looked like it would be worth it, I used all the eating space I had left loading up the crab legs.  That was this buffet's shining star for me, which made it a 3 star instead of lowering it down to a 2.  The crab legs.  I had A LOT.  Nice meaty crab legs, and all the crabs I could eat too.  I'm surprised my allergies didn't start acting up.  But if they had, it would have been worth it.. . Studio B ... Yes ... just keep those crab legs stocked!
