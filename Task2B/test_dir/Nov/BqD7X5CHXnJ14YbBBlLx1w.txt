Great wine list with a formidable number is sherries by the glass.  The Agua de Serrano cocktail is a must try - sweet with a wonderful seductive heat from habanero pepper.  The list of tapas promises to deliver a different experience every time you dine here.  The chicken croquettes were rich but light and airy.  The stuffed dates were the perfect mix of sweet and savory.  6 small plates between the 2 of us was a great taste without being overly filling.  We didn't try the paellas this time, but will definitely be back.
The best paella!! Try the crispy chicken too! Best part of my experience is our superb waiter, Pedro..very friendly! Takes time to discuss menu even during rush hour!! We will surely comeback :)
Overall:. This is one of the best restaurants I have ever visited in my life. It blew my expectations on tapas and every dish was impeccably seasoned, as if I could feel the effort placed in the design of each dish.. . Ambience/Service:. Being inside the trendy Aria, the restaurant feels hip. The service was impeccable, probably because we were one of the first customers in an early lunch time.. . Food:. I have never been a fan of Spanish Tapas in America, because my general view is that they are very overpriced for only a small amount of food. This restaurant changed my opinion of this cuisine.. . It was a very memorable experience. The best dish, in my opinion, was the seasoned Black Rice, which was a party in my mouth. I still can't fathom what kind of seasoning went into the dish, but it was just amazing and each bite oozed with umami. The Raspberry Tuna skewers were a pleasant surprise, especially when I found out they dabbed a bit of wasabi paste inside the raspberries. The wasabi really cuts the sourness of the raspberry - it is now my favorite way to eat these berries! I also tried the Spanish Tortilla: creamy potatoes, melt-in-your-mouth onions, all blended in so well with the soft omelette. It's exactly as homey as how my Spanish co-workers made it. I also tried the White Fish Ceviche, which was extremely flavorful with just the right amount of spicy kick. Overall, this place is simply amazing and I would visit it every time I come to Las Vegas.
So I'm going to start off with this: for the past year I've been an avid die hard fan of Jaleo at the Aria so I was skeptical about visiting another Spanish / tapas restaurant in Las Vegas, man was I wrong. It took a little help from Jaleo because on Friday night I visited the restaurant and had one of the worst culinary experiences at a high end restaurant; food was extremely greasy and salty to the point of being inedible, servers seemed uninterested and made me wait for dishes for extended periods of time and when I complained about salt on my dish she even took longer to replace , like telling me how dare you criticize our perfect food.... . I know this review is about Julian Serrano but  I wanted to point out what made me want to visit it. The very next day (Saturday) I book a reservation for one... Words can't explain the flavors, service ... Everything about my experience was beyond my expectations, from the oxtail to the tomato cake to the risotto , I can only say without a doubt that the food was PERFECT. . If I could I would give them ten stars but for now 5 will do the job. . Now every time I head back to Vegas (which is quite often) I have to go to Julian Serrano and be mesmerized once again.
Cool restaurant and the foods are very good. Came with a group of 6 and I ordered the wild mushroom soup with roasted padron peppers. Both were good and cost about $20. Portion is small so it's considered pricy to me. Overall it's a fun restaurant and I will definitely come back again.
Service : excellent . Food: excellent. Decor and ambiance: good. . Came here for dinner with 3 other people we ordered, we had no problem getting seated because it was a little early.. Anthony was serving us and he was really great, super helpful and attentive. kudos to him for being really outstanding.. We order the potata bravas, grilled eggplant, flatbread with tomato and mozzarella, short ribs, lamb meatballs, duck confit and calamari.. Calamari was really good what out it over the top was that they had pieces of fried lemon in it. I would not have thought it but I was sooooo good.. Potata bravas, lamb meatballs, grilled eggplant, duck confit were really executed well.. The flatbread was really nothing to right home about and was nothing you would not find at a deli in New York.. . Overall will be back
I was in Vegas for a friend's birthday, and he said we were checking this place out in the Aria for dinner since the owner was an old family friend from their days living nearby in San Francisco (my friend's family has since relocated to the Boston area). I think since I was in their group, I became, as Andrew Keegan so eloquently stated in the seminal classic "10 Things I Hate About You"...cool by association. They really rolled out the red carpet for our party of 6. Here's a listing of all the things we got to try: Yellowtail sushi, Ahi tuna, Serrano ham, grilled pepper with goat cheese,, beef and cheese tenderloin, prawns, spicy potatoes, red sangria, bacon wrapped stuffed dates (personal favorite...amazing flavor and extremely tendor bacon), and two different kinds of paella: seafood and valenciana. I'm a huge fan of paellas, and these were really good. To wash it all down, we had Nvanmanthia wine, and some churros to finish it off. After leaving, I thought they'd have to throw the cape on me, James Brown style, and help me out...I was stuffed. I didn't think Sin City had anything beyond a Denny's and some buffet bars, so this was a welcome surprise.
Our cousin took us here as this place is one of her favorites. My husband and I have never had tapas before and it was our first! We got about 7 different tapas, white sangria and churros (laugh now but they were sooooooo good!!) Our server was very attentive and friendly. Some of the tapas we got were the dates, short ribs, duck confit, beef tartar, yellowfin tuna, just to name a few. Our favorite was were the dates tapas and the beef tartar tapas. The white sangria was really really good and would recommend it! My husband even enjoyed it and he isn't one for those "fruity" drinks. It is a little pricey but well worth the tastes and flavors!
Love this place.  It's a Spanish tapas restaurant so order several dishes if you're trying to get full or wanting to get a taste of the different items on the menu.  My friends and I ordered 4 tapas plus an order of the mixed paella:. . On a scale from 1-5 with 5 being the best.... . Seared scallop: 5. Stuffed dates: 5 (must order!!!!). Asparagus: 5. Gambas: 5 (there's a bit of a spicy kick to it, but it's delicious). Mixed paella: 5!!!!!! SO DAMN GOOD!! = must order!!!!!. . I'm still craving for the paella ever since I had it.  It was absolutely delicious.  Now being back in Houston, I'm trying to find a restaurant that serves delicious paella. Wish me luck! . . I highly recommend that restaurant because everything we ordered was absolutely amazing, and definitely order the stuffed dates and paella, if nothing else!!
Didn't enjoy the food at all. The only reason they get 2 stars is because the staff was super friendly. The steak wasn't cooked the right way, actually sent it back twice and they still put in on my bill. Never going back there that's for sure. Total rip off !!
JS was so delicious!  We ordered the seafood paella and the four of us cleaned the plates.  It was as good as the one I had in Barcelona. I also got the white sangria...not too sweet!  It was perfect!  We also got the short ribs...it was good but I have had better hence the 4 stars instead of 5.  I would get the paella again but would definitely order a different appetizer.
Awesome tapas! Everything served to us were fantastic. The chicken croquette, ox tail, scallops, duck salad, pork tacos mmm mmmm. Definitely get a pitcher of red sangria!
We have eaten here before and the food was really good. However, this time we were really diasapointed. The food lacked taste. The paella was so bad that we had to send it back. The desserts were okay. The appetizers were not much to remember. Not sure if I would like to spend this much money for such mediocre food.
Excellent small plates. Good selection and very tasty. Service is excellent. Wine selection and prices very good. Highly recommended
This is my second time here. I visited here 2 days in a row since it was THAT good. The first time I came here i just had 4 taps: black rice, lobster fideua, grilled lamb chop and fried calamari. Everything was so good except for the fried calamaries. For some reason the calamari was really a miss... It was bland and tasteless. . The second day (today) we were really disputing if we should have all tapas again since the dishes we had yesterday were so good but decided to try a paella. We did order a white fish ceviche. It is perfect for an appetizer, super savory but a little too spicy. It was good for us since we shared it but if you wanted to finish it by yourself, it might be a little too spicy. Paella didn't take full 40 minutes which is great! It was so delicious packed with flavor. I would have really regretted if I didn't try the paella. I don't know how they cook the mussels but they were so moist. . . . Fantastic restaurant that I would return again for sure if I had the opportunity to.
