Went on Halloween when Jermaine Dupri was DJing. (I'm a huge fan of him). . Getting in is very easy if you use a promoter (e.g. skipped the general admission line, got in for free with my group consisting of 2 guys and 2 girls, ladies received a voucher for 1 free drink up to $15.) Otherwise, it's $30-50 to get in. Bouncers outside the club are respectful and professional.. . Once inside, you're met with a large running waterfall as the backdrop. Beautiful interior. Restrooms are very clean and have very courteous attendants. The clubbing experience here was an absolute BLAST. Music was mostly hip-hop this night, LOTS OF BASS. Loved it. The club was filled mostly with people in their 20s and 30s. The fact that Jermaine Dupri was DJing made my night! Great job, Tryst!. . Drinks are typical Vegas price. $17 for an AMF. $12 for a cranberry vodka.. . . NEGATIVES:. . -0.5 STARS for having Jermaine Dupri show up late (~1:15 am). He was scheduled to be there starting at 10 pm. The DJing subbing for him before he arrived was still good, though.. . -1 STAR for the overly aggressive bouncers INSIDE the club. My friends and I were dancing right in front of the DJ and stayed behind the velvet rope the entire time. Suddenly and arbitrarily, the bouncers decided everyone was too close to the DJ and aggressively SHOVED everyone back (both guys and girls). When it's a packed dancefloor, YOU DO NOT PUSH PEOPLE AROUND. I saw girls fall down because of these bouncers pushing them, drinks were spilled. Very disrespectful to your patrons.. . In the end, it's not the best club in Vegas, but a very solid choice. Just go when your favorite DJ is playing here, and you'll have a great time!
Our favorite club in Vegas! My two friends and I went on a Thursday night... the guestlist line was professional and ran smoothly. We were in the club with our free drink tickets within minutes of arriving. I liked the concept of the tables with bottle service being accessible to everyone, we made friends with a group of guys our age and danced for hours. The waterfall inside the club was a cool touch and the DJ played a great mix of songs to dance to - hip hop, rap, pop, etc. We'll be back to Tryst next Vegas trip.
Not the best club in Vegas but it is definitely a great place party if there is a specific event going on there. It's not that big of a club but if you're looking for a great place to go clubbing then this is a good spot.
