A LOT OF FOOD!!! If you are starving and want a lot of food worth your buck, come to this place. Anything you order will be a giant serving! Prepare for a wait though. This place is very popular.
My husband and I ate here 9/29/13 and boy was it fabulous! I got the tractor combo (eggs.sausage.and French toast!!) Yummy! And my hubby I believe got the man vs food favorite but I'm not 100% sure (biscuits. Chicken fried steak. Chipotle sauce) ...the portions are huge and it was so cheap!! $30 for both ..even IHOP costs more! Highly recommend this place wish we had one in our hometown.
Walking through all of that construction.  Areas that should have been blocked off by the casino, we're open and we ended up near very dirty areas that were quite dangerous. No signs with directions to where you're going. . . Now to Hash House A Go Go. I'm not sure if the food is good or not, and I'm bummed with the experience i received here. LOUD music that was a bit much. People were watching football and you couldn't even hear them cheering. The bitch calling out reservations on the loud speaker, was way too damn loud. So if you're hearing impaired or like that noise, try it out. The staff is obviously ill mannered and lack education, and definitely don't understand customer service.  They stood around the host desk, singing and dancing and ignoring customers coming up to make reservations. . . Oh and did I mention that it smells like a club. The cigarette smoke was gross. . . Enjoy!
I thoroughly enjoyed this and would have more if it wasn't such a goddam zoo inside.. The wait is long and slightly chaotic but hey you can still get some drinks while you wait which I find super awesome.  That said the bloody Mary's were great! Spicy though so keep that in mind.. . I got the corned beef hash and loved it- a lot of tender corned beef with perfect amount of cheese. Boyf got the fried chicken with maple and mashed potatoes- really tasty! Observing other diners though, next time I defs gots to get a Benedict. They are massive and topped with creamy looking goodness.. . And our waitress was such a sweetheart and managed expectations upfront by letting us know how long the food would take (40 min).. . All in all, if you have the the time (wait to seat, wait to get served) and the appetite this is a great spot. Will def come back next time I'm in LV.
Delicious. .. but huge portions.  Share them.  I had waffles with bacon. So good.  Friends had scramble with potatos....excellent!  The other had sage chicken man v food. It was huge!  Had a little kick to it. .. but really good.  Get there early. ... there was a huge line to get in.
Huge proportions and great tasting food, that came out fast and hot. We waited 30 minutes on a Sunday morning but it went by quickly because we went downstairs and gambled. Give your self plenty of time when coming here because the service can be kind of slow.
Stayed at The Linq Hotel this past weekend during their official re-opening (formerly The Quad hotel) for my friend's Halloween Bachelorette Weekend...while my hotel stay was awful, Hash House A Go Go was probably the best part of my stay at The Linq! lol. . After returning to my room from a night out and realizing that I was STARVING, I decided to head down to the lobby around 4am and see what was open and order food to bring back to the room. I was thrilled to see that the restaurant was open 24hrs and was directed to the bar to place my take out order. The restaurant itself didn't seem super large but had a cool, comfortable and casual vibe. . . The late night menu wasn't extensive, but it had just what I was in the mood for...Steak & Eggs! For about $15, the special came with a boneless Rib-Eye steak, Scrambled Eggs, Mashed Potatoes & Biscuit. I also ordered an Orange Jc which came out to like $6! If I had known, I probably would've skipped the juice. The wait was a bit long for my order, but when it arrived I remembered to ask for butter & A-1 sauce for my steak before I returned to my room to dive into my food. . . Of course I wasn't expecting the plating to be as beautiful as the pictures I've seen for the regular dishes served in the restaurant (lol), but when I opened my take out container I was NOT expecting that much food!!! LOL The portions are HUGE! Two people could've easily shared the meal for sure. . . First of all, my steak was perfectly cooked, flavorful and SO delicious. The scrambled eggs were large, fluffy folds and were really good. The mashed potatotes were thick, well seasoned, tasty and could probably feed an army. And the best thing next to the steak was the biscuit. The biscuit was BIG! It was soft and slightly doughy in the middle (but in a good way!)...it was so perfect with the whipped butter! I was in heaven and really glad that no one could witness me eating this amazing meal in my hotel bed! . . Looking forward to returning here and actually dining in the restaurant!
Oh really? 4 stars? How? I ordered the sage chicken. It was dry... Rosco's in LA is so much better... or maybe I'm just spoiled by Rosco's... and Popeyes... Popeye's are better than dat piece of dry meat that I had on top of that mountain of bacon waffle.. which is pretty good... so next time. I would stay away from dat sage chicken and get that waffle at the side.. oh.. chicken pot pie sucked too.. Marie calendars would be better... sigh.. what a let down. We waited 2 hours for dat...
I'm still not totally sure how I feel about this place. The portion sizes are definitely outrageous. No one should ever be able to finish their plate here. The food was all OK, but nothing really stood out besides the size of everything. I guess go here for the novelty, if you are super hungry and have 6 other people with you to share your plate.
Artery clogging, jolly good time having everything at this place.. . What can I say about Hash House that i'm sure hasn't already been mentioned a mouthful of times. See what I did there? And seeing is believing when you see the portions here. Holy macaroni!. . Ginormous portions. Crazy delicious food. Delicious boozy drinks. Fun atmosphere. . . While the portions were clearly more than either of us could eat, and we could have shared a single item... then why are you in vegas if not to indulge and go overboard? I felt zero guilt only eating a third of my plate and giving the rest of it to a hungry homeless person on the strip. Why not? . . If you come here on the weekends, especially during peak meal hours... expect to wait! While the wait may seem daunting, it went faster than expected. Talk to people in line with you, meet new people. It's fun. We met a couple from the UK there on vacation. Super awesome accents.... but I digress from the topic at hand. Hash House! . . Huge fan of this place. My waistline and taste buds thank you hash house. Well done.. . Side note: chicken and waffles is a winner. winner, winner chicken dinner-- er breakfast! p.s. sneaky bacon slices in the waffles! Meatloaf breakfast thingymabob was also bomb. Oh, and the drinks. Yea the drinks. Do it.
I am so disappointed. I have heard such good things but after last night I will never come to this one again! I came here with my boyfriend and my family because there were in town staying at the hotel. First off the hostess looked and sounded stoned as well as being on her cell phone as we were leaving. Next, our server had no idea what "on tap" meant as well as not knowing what beers they had. The biggest issue we had was the fact that they brought each dinner out 10 min apart... There for 4 of us so by the time everyone finally had their meal the first order brought out was cold. As if that wasn't bad enough I had to grilled salmon and it was so dry I was eating off my boyfriends plate instead... I will NEVER come back to this particular Hash House again I would also encourage anyone else that is considering going here to avoid it at all costs. So not worth the money!!!!
Okay, tons of food and at a reasonable price. Presentation is great, the wait is usually long; but worth it. Leave with a full tummy and a big smile!
Delicious. .. but huge portions.  Share them.  I had waffles with bacon. So good.  Friends had scramble with potatos....excellent!  The other hadsage chicken man v food. It was huge!  Had a little kick to it. .. but really good.  Get there early. ... there was a huge line to get in.
Place is great had to wait on a Friday morning but worth the wait!!! The sizes are extreme, had to share with my friend and still took left overs back to the hotel! Definitely not a place if you are on a diet or even don't eat much!
This was my first time eating here and it was very good. The location is hard to find but if you know what your looking for pretty much anyone can tell you where to go. .    The atmosphere is cool, much like everything in Vegas. The food was strange but very tasty. Everything seemed kind of mushed up on one plate, but eaten all together it had a really good flavor. The portions are very big so it's easy to share. Overall I would recommend  eating here for breakfast and some solid food.
Great meal after our Vegas Ragnar experience.  Gary was spot on not only with his recommendations and with his service and his personality. Delicious and wonderful.
Love Hash House! It is by far the best breakfast restaurant in Las Vegas! The servers are outstanding- shout out to Gabby and Gary for the great service. Be prepared to wait but grab a Bloody Mary or tangerine mimosa and enjoy the people watching!
Great food, open 24/7!  No wait - large dining area!  . Lots of great items on the menu - . We had the pancakes bananas foster- large enough to share for 2..... . My only wish is, that this place was accesible from the street; it took a while to get there through the casino... . but well worth the journey!
There is a lot of food on the plate, but it is really just average. The Bloody Mary was fabulous, but nothing about the food would make me want to come back again.
The staff here was great; part of our party was running late but they worked with us to maintain our reservation.  The wait staff was very friendly as well.  That said the food was rather bland.  They bring a lot of it, but it is quite average.. . Certainly not a place to avoid, but it shouldn't be high up on one's list.
This place is ah-mazing and you will NOT regret it!! I highly recommend splitting a meal with a friend, as the portions are HUGE. My Mom and I split the sage fried chicken and waffles and we BOTH got a chicken breast and two waffles. No one can eat an entire entree. The plates are the size of serving trays. I am not exaggerating. The food is fabulous. The sage fried chicken was a unique flavor. I really enjoyed how crunchy the batter was. The waffles had bacon in them. Who doesn't like that? Seriously it was a wonderful, flavorful, exciting meal. We were so full that we didn't eat again until dinner time. My fellow diners all enjoyed their meals except for the corned beef hash. I was told that was less then good but not terrible. . . The bloody mary's are incredible as well, served with a large piece of bacon, it's a meal on it's own. Go now, do not pass go. Eat here!
Got here on a busy Sunday for brunch and there was a huge line, I expected that. I didn't care because I love brunch and I've been dying to try to this place!! Once we got seated, the waiter took drink jerseys and recommended their kiwi watermelon lemonade so I ordered one because it sounded amazing! I mean, who doesn't like watermelon?!?!  However, I was a little disappointed with the drink because it was overly sweet from kiwi syrup and I couldn't taste any watermelon. We ordered the chicken hash and fried chicken Benedict. It took them 45 mins to bring our food out and I was not a happy camper. Good thing the food was delicious and the Benedict even had a kick to it! Just like all the other reviews, the portions were huge! You can easily order one entree and share between two people. I was so full from this meal this ended up being my only meal for the day. I was feeling unhealthily full. Overall the food here was very good and definitely worth trying out at least once. I personally will not be back any time soon due to the wait time for food and how unhealthy I felt after the meal.
You never have to walk around hungry in vegas, and the latest addon to join in central strip is this 24-hour chain. Located inside Quad, soon to be Linq Hotel, you will see a escalator right in the middle of the Casino floor, which will bring you to the goodies upstairs. . . Menu will leave you with a lot of different options and new flavors. And if you never been, you should ask for some suggestions or maybe go with the marked favorites. Its a laidback atmosphere overall and you shouldnt have to bring your fanciest wig to stay safe (Although you can, since its vegas).. . Whichever you decide to order, you will not be served an ordinary dish. It will be presented in a magnificent way, probably somehow include waffles even if its main, and HUGE! But dont be intimidated by the size of the portion, this is the place where you dont have to be afraid of asking for a doggy bag.. . Prices are cheap, service is cool and the place is opened 24/7.... How could you complain?
Food was okay as hard to screw up waffles with bacon cooked inside.  Service was frentic and I was sitting at bar and it took almost 30 minutes for that aforementioned waffle to show up. They recommended people to order before even could get a seat at the bar.. . It is interesting to see that a town that built itself on the cheap steak and egg buffet is not serving up trendy farm to tablish breakfast places where one dish cost more than the buffet used it.. . Overall not worth the wait as almost rather gotten hot cakes at a local mcdonalds then eat here.
This place has horrible service! Won't seat till full party there so give away your spot and no cell service nothing like the one on Sahara! Don't bother!
Hash House is a chain and the location on the strip is upstairs in a semi sketchy casino.  The decor and menu make it seem like it's farm fresh but it's definitely not - don't let them fool you.  The portions here are disgustingly large - each can be shared by 3 - 4 people.  The price is incredibly cheap compared to most Vegas prices though.  The food was decent, but really the appeal is the size of the plates.  Definitely makes you feel like an ass when you walk outside and there are homeless people though - be a decent person and give them your leftovers - there will be a lot of them.
THE RESTAURANT IS IN THE LINQ HOTEL (formally The Quad Hotel)  and boy..... the food is no joke!!! Its pretty darn good!!! But make sure to bring your 3rd and even your 4th stomach because the portions are so huge that it can feed 3 kids or 2 avg size adults!. . So my boyfriend ordered  the Andy's sage fried chicken with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs... which was the "Man VS Food" favorite...I was totally surprised that even my boyfriend couldnt finish it!  I ordered  the Crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin with tomato, spinach, bbq cream and scrambled eggs.  I never realized that pork tenderloin could be so huge!!!  So good but I only ate a quarter of it . . Overall the waiter was great and polite.... only had a 10 min wait cuz we came around 8am...by the time we left the restaurant,  the waiting area was SO FULL!!!--- and mind ya it was a Monday morning!!! I would definitely come back...but ill make sure to share food with somone !
Lil bit different than the last time I was here.....no selling of the bloody Mary's while you wait. Booooo! I just thought I'd ask about half portions but noooooo. Whatever, it kinda worked out, because it seems to me as if the portions were brought down a notch or two. But they can and should be shared. I had the smoked salmon egg white scramble with Brie cheese & griddles mashed potatoes.  It was ok but I should've gone with my first mind and got the chicken salad....next time, cause i will be back!
I've eaten at Hash House before and it has always been great, but this review is all about the service.  Feeling a little hung over after a long night on the strip, i stopped in to get something hearty and delicious for breakfast this morning and Hash House was an easy choice.  When i looked at the menu I was a bit overwhelmed, as everything looked good.  This is where this excellent service came in to play.  After alerting my server, Sarah, to my dilemma she was able to suggest the perfect breakfast and experience.  She suggested I start with a peppercorn vodka bloody mary as an appetizer, which was ideal for my situation.  It was a total clutch move, Sarah is clearly a pro.  And when it came to my other beverages, my coffee and water were never empty as the service was very attentive.  For my main dish, Sarah suggested the Chorizo Hash, which was perfect.  It was also huge, and I only got through about half.  We ended up bagging up the remainder and I was assured the hash would make for an excellent left over meal.  Sarah was so in point with her suggestions, attitude and attentivness, I was happy and knew that I would be well taken care of everytime I saw her awesome red hair and smile come from around the corner.  Thanks again.
Underwhelmed.  Waited for about an hour just to be seated.  We ordered the Chicken and Waffles and honestly, it was pretty mediocre.  The chicken was solid (crispy skin, white meat, good flavor) but the waffles were horrible.  Absolutely no flavor.. . Honestly, it didn't live up to the hype.
This is the perfect end the night restaurant. I try to come here at least once when I'm in las Vegas. Beware the portions are HUGE! They look likea 4000 calorie beautiful nightmare. complete alcohol soaker, follows by a food coma.
The food at Hash House A Go Go was really good.. . Unfortunately, we had to wait a really long time to get it. . . It's awesome when a place is popular, and I don't mind waiting if the expectations are set right. But the staff at Hash House A Go Go was severely underestimating wait times and discouraging people from leaving the lobby of the restaurant.This was undoubtedly costing revenue from the casino, where people might have entertained themselves while waiting. Perhaps a cell phone alert system would help Hash House A Go Go manage the wait?. . Once we were seated, our excellent waiter promptly warned us that the kitchen was operating on a 45 minute delay. This was annoying, but since the waiter set those expectations, we were able to cope.. . The food arrived and my God, these portion sizes were out of control. I could easily have shared my meal with 1.5, maybe 2 other people. There was so much food that I couldn't stop feeling guilty about the inevitable waste, because even if scrambled eggs reheated well, I had no place to refrigerate them in my hotel room. The pancakes were the size of vinyl records, and my biscuit was bigger than a regulation-sized softball. It was insane.. . All that said, the food was delicious. Really good! My chicken hash was well-seasoned and the hash browns were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the huge side of fruit was fresh. My husband's bowl of oatmeal, aside from being giant, also came laden with tons of fresh fruit. We all liked our food.. . If Hash House A Go Go got their queue style in order and reduced their portion sizes to something resembling a responsible serving, they'd easily earn 4 stars from me. As for now, this is place I'd enjoy going again but wouldn't bother waiting in that line for.
First tip.  Sit at the bar it's not worth an hour wait if there are just 2 of you!  The bar tender is quick to the point and makes the experience great!  The portions are ginormous!  We thankfully just ordered one item.  The sage fried chicken Benedict.  It's a total twisted giant plate of food.  My only complaint is it's served with scrambled eggs.  A runny poached egg would've sent me intoa food coma :) the ambience is weird but food is fun!
Wooooow the portions are sooooo big!!!! Everything you order is oversized!!! I couldn't finish a thing, which would've been nice if I had somewhere to take it back. But we hit the road right after (not smart, as we all got struck with massive food coma after our meal here), so unfortunately a lot went to waste :(. . My friend and I shared the chicken and waffles. The fried chicken was nice. Crispy skin, juicy meat. Very enjoyable. The waffles were whatever. I expected a lot more out of them, but they're just waffles. This dish comes with a lot of just random things on it, I suppose for aesthetics. But you will really just ignore all that filler stuff. We just had to try it because it was a famous dish at a famous restaurant. 3/5 ratings because it wasn't amazing, but it was still good.. . The wait was long, so they were giving out free mimosas and bloody marys! We were still recovering from our weekend.. So we really didn't take part in that offer.. But I thought it was nice. The atmosphere is very loud, and the waiters are always hustling. I recommend sharing your plates, because the portions are seriously gigantic. Don't know how one person could eat all that food!
This place is insanely good.  While waiting it was fun to take a picture with the Bull Statue near the entrance and read all the plaques on the walls from who had been there.. . HUGE PORTIONS! - So be warned! . . I am from NJ and am used to diner food (large portions of home cooked comfort foods), but this was diner portions of creatively delicious comfort food. (they deep fried pasta!). . I would definitely go again!
I was simply amazed at the size and presentation of the chicken and waffles plate! It is the biggest plate I've ever seen in my life!  It's just a massive tower of yummyness. The 3 waffles are filled with crispy bacon, the Fried Sage Crusted Chicken was really flavorful and crispy while the inside of the chicken was juicy and it paired well with the fried leeks and maple syrup.. . I also tried the HH original which is made w/smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach,roasted red pepper cream and topped w/ two basted eggs. Pretty good too.
Our server Katie was very knowledgable on the menu, she gave us some recommendations on the favorites. . . I ordered the HH meatloaf and the BF got the #5 burger. The portions are really big. I ate probably only a quarter of the entree and had to take the rest home. They bring out biscuits before your meal. . . Delicious.
A hidden gem and quite possibly the best breakfast I've ever had. I got the sage chicken and waffles and my girl go the brown sugar banana pancake with eggs and sausage. Everything was absolutely unreal and the portions were too big for one person to finish on their own. The bloody Mary's were also a hit. Will frequent every time I end up in Vegas.
Food porn!  This place is awesome!  I went for brunch and everything was amazingly delicious including our waiter Gary.  . . I started off my meal with one of the best bloody Mary's that I've ever had.  It was perfectly spicy with jalapeno stuffed olives.. . The sage chicken and waffles were yummmmmmy!  The chicken was tender, juicy and crispy.  The waffles had bacon in them!!  Awesome!. . I also recommend the chorizo and jalapeno hash.  It wasn't too spicy.  It had delicious potatoes, egg, tomato, chorizo and peppers served on a cast iron skillet.  My only issue is it could have been warmer.. . Overall this place is awesome.  The portion sizes are massive. The average wait for a table on a Sunday morning was about 20 mins.  The service was friendly and pretty quick.  I will be back next time I'm in Vegas!
I really wish I would have read the reviews before I came because the other 2 people at my table could have all shared one plate of food! We came here after a morning of roulette and the wait was about 30 minutes on a Thursday around 10am. It was pretty busy but it was fun looking at the wall of famous people who have been to here to eat. When we sat down, our waiter came over immediately to get our drinks. I was so overwhelmed looking at the menu, I really wanted to try it all! . . I ended up getting the sage fried chicken and waffles, my fiance ordered the Andy's fried chicken benedict and my dad got the cobb salad. Oh man, the portion of all the entrees were crazy. I had no idea how big they were until we ordered and we started seeing the waiters bring it out to other tables. My fried chicken was very delicious and juicy. I loved the bacon waffles..I mean anything with bacon is good. I really liked the chicken benedict also, the sauce that comes with it with the mash potatoes is perfect. I demolished my fiance's mash potatoes. I only could eat one waffle and one chicken...it was huge. The cobb salad was also huge, it probably could have fed a family of 5. . . After the meal, you definitely have to walk a couple miles to get rid of a piece of fried chicken. It was worth the $10-$15 an entree.  I will be sure that next time I go, I'll probably have to share with people at my time because it ended up being a waste of food since I couldn't finish it and my hotel didn't have a frig/microwave. Overall, the service was great and food was delicious. Will for sure come back next time.
legit food! breakfast was insanely good!. . Got a skillet, wife got monster sized waffles. . Good coffee too!
I had the eggs, sausage, biscuits, and crispy potatoes. Price was a bit on the high side, but not out of the ordinary for vegas . Egss were good, sausage was pretty bland. Biscuit was large but lacked flavor. Service was great and they were really busy.
Tried the Sage fried chicken Benedict due to the Man vs Food recommendation. Kids had the blueberry pancakes. Way too much biscuit for the Benedict but the taste was good and portions were pretty amazing. Great service too.
Came here yesterday for Thanksgiving brunch. We put our name down because we were told it was a 45 min to an hour wait. We walked around the new hotel LINQ and then went back after half hour. We were seated shortly after. Service was excellent!!!  The food was awesome, my son and I got the fried chicken with bacon waffles.  It was SO GOOD!  Hubby had a BBB sandwich which was good too but our dish was awesome!   The chicken was juicy and hsd a great sage flavor. The waffles had a long slice of bacon in each waffles. I can't wait to come back!  Just be prepared to wait.
Portions were outrageous.....got 2 meals out of the flap jack combo (brown sugar bananas). Everything was delicious down to the homemade biscuits.  Reasonably priced for being on the strip as well.  Expect a wait in the morning hours but we'll worth it!
Definitely a must have, you can't beat the portions and variety. Most amazing breakfast ever!
Ordered steak n eggs, seeing the black angus cow I thought it would have been good. Unfortunately it was to chewy n greasy. Service is ok, but kinda slow. The biggest issue I had was the location. Kinda dark, no windows or good lighting and there's strong muggy/rosemary scent in the air.
Firstly, this restaurant is in The Linq Hotel, formerly The Quad. Expect a line. Waited only about 15 minutes to be seated, though. Greeted by Tony our waiter who was really warm, friendly, sincere, and knowledgeable. Ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. Massive is an understatement! The only thing is that it came out kind of lukewarm. But the problem was rectified REALLY fast! Tony put in an order for fresh chicken. Then the manager Eric came and asked if everything was okay. He was a class act-very attentive, friendly, and responsive. I explained what happened. The next thing you know lickety split...new fresh hot plate hand delivered by Eric in 2 minutes! Problem solved! The chicken and waffles were really tasty! The sweet and savory is a great combo. My girlfriend and I shared the plate and STILL had leftovers!!  Late night munchies-problem solved!!. Thank you Eric and Tony for making our experience nothing short of wonderful!
Oh god I wish we had this place in  Vancouver, BC! I LOVED IT! . . My friend and I heard alot of good things about Hash House A Go Go so we had to try it out! Knowing it was opening late at night was a plus too! We went there after a long night of partying. We ordered the Chicken Benedict and the Chicken and Waffles and shared both. . . We got the chicken benny first and my lord it was amazing! My taste buds were on another level! My mouth is watering just thinking about it now haha. This had a layering of heaven! It has mashed potatoeson the bottom, with a huge piece of fried chicken on top of it, then hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, mozzarella, scrambled eggs with chipotle cream sauce on top.. HEAVEN! . . Shortly after we got the Fried Chicken & Waffles. It has two fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks. By this time we got pretty full and only finished halfway and packed the rest to go. The portions were huge and sooooo good! . . We ended up going there twice.. I really wanted to go a third time haha!
