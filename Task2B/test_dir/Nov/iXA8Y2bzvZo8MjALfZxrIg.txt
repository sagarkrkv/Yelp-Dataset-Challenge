Good food and great experience ! Kinda expected more out of the drink. Had a strawberry margarita .. Maybe just an off day but that's okay. I'll still be back. !
Had a slightly better burger here than I did at some of the hotel restaurants at a couple places just off the strip, so that's good I suppose.  Pretty run of the mill food otherwise.  Will give them credit for sheer size and ridiculousness of an item such as the Volcano burger.. . As others have pointed out its not all about the food here.  Atmosphere is king and boy does it have it.  What is "it"?  I'm not sure really...but it is entertaining to say the least.. . I did lulz at the never ending stream of Jimmy Buffet videos on the televisions.
Took my husband here for his birthday. The experience was good, but the food is ok. I'm a local so to venture out to a tourist trap is rare. I love the casual atmosphere and the decor was very thematic to the whole margarita vibe. The drinks were very good. I had the bluberry pomegranate nojito and my husband had some banana flavored drink.. . We ordered the nachos and seafood mac and cheese. I guess after a hangover the food is excellent. The nachos definitely was getting ordered everywhere and it was fun to eat. The mac and cheese though was so so. It did have a good portion of seafood but I just felt it was a little bland. . . Service is excellent so no complaints there. Our server was very polite and attentive, and our food came out in a timely manner. . . I do have one pet peeve, the design of the restaurant makes it hard to find the actual entrance.
Had a great experience at this restaurant. Food was fantastic and our server Rene was wonderful. She was professional yet down to earth and very attentive to our needs. Next time I am in Las Vegas I will definitely return to Margaritaville!
The decor here is fun, an airplane hangs from the ceiling and there are I think sharks too.  We were seated in an area that was so dark you could barely see the person across from you.  The food here is okay, I had a carne asada taco and a carnitas taco. They were good but pretty basic.  Nothing much to them.  The drinks are okay too.  I had the mango margarita which was fine but again nothing much to it. The prices are fair,  not too expensive.  This is an overall okay place.
First time at Margaritaville and I was very impressed with the service. To be honest I didn't expect much from the place at first, most casual bars have mediocre food and service, but I was definitely wrong. Our server Sean was great, he made outstanding recommendations on drinks as well as the food. He was just a courteous and genuine person, and I would return here on my next trip to Vegas based on his service alone. Totally recommend the Perfect Margarita and Nachos!
It's alright overall. The food is average, nothing too special. You can easily get better food and much better priced off the strip anywhere. This is just a touristy area that traps all those tourists that come to visit without a vehicle or know where to go. . . My main complaint is the service which was pretty bad, some of it is forgivable but a good chunk of it isn't. I won't outright name the server on here but I will definitely not be coming back because of him unless I get a friend who works here as my server. . . We came in with a party of 10 or 12, they put together a set of tables of different kinds, some round and some rectangle, like okay seriously? You can't put together a bunch of rectangular shapes and call it a day? You had to add the odd shaped table to our group, not that big of a deal we can manage. We were here to celebrate a birthday so it wasn't that big of a deal. . . We expected slow service with our group, it's normal so that's not anything I'll comment on. When the server finally came around with waters and asked us what we wanted for drinks. I ordered a passion fruit guava cocktail and someone on the other end ofthe table ordered a watermelon agave fresca. Not all of us knew each other as it was a birthday celebration, there's bound to be people you just met and have the birthday girl as a mutual friend so I didn't know the person that ordered the watermelon agave fresca. Our server mixed our drinks up, when the other person told him it was screwed up because she took a sip out of it, the server came back to me and asked if I had taken a drink which I answered no and he apologized that he mixed the drinks and gave me the drink which someone else took a sip out of and gave the other person her drink. Now, normally servers will ask to have your drink replaced because they messed up and someone else took a swig of it. I was expecting that, but nope he didn't. He placed the already drunken drink down on front of me and I was disgusted. Not only do I get less of a drink but I also had someone I didn't know drink out of it and he expected me to drink it? If it was someone I knew I wouldn't have cared as much.. . The next thing that happened was ordering a second round of drinks, I asked for a beer, didn't specify what kind of beer I wanted and the server brought a landshark in a 20oz cup, I wanted a landshark but I didn't know there were multiple sizes and the server assumed I wanted the large size with the extra $3 charge. . . If I was being charged $10 for a drink I would have gotten another specialty drink instead of a beer, it's overpriced for a landshark. When I confronted the server he got super defensive saying that I just wanted a beer, after a few friends ordered beers, which is fine but if you made a mistake at least own up to it and not argue with me that I wasn't specific in what I wanted. The menu only had one price on it and I was expecting that price and size of beer.. . His only saving grace was showing me there was another bathroom when the main bathrooms were closed. . . TL;DR version. . -Bad server, I'm never going back unless people I know are working. . -Expect attitude from the servers there who make assumptions and charge you extra.. -If I wasn't in with a party I would have walked out because THAT is how bad my experience was.. -Food is average and expensive
Going for a light lunch.  Loved that we got there early and were able to get a seat in the fishing boat.  Just a neat experience and the booth seating is comfy.  I had the refreshing Blueberry pomegranate margarita.  Served tall and on the rocks.  I love the classic margarita served here, but thought I try something new, I was glad I did.  My dad tried the Last mango in Paris and we both agreed it was also worth the try.. . I wasn't supper hungry so I had the Corn and crab chowder.  Nice and thick with corn and crab, with a nice heat to it.  Very comforting and filling.  I shared the Asiago crab dip to just have a little something on the side of the chowder and it was a perfect complement. It was also filled with crab and the top had a wonderful crispy crust.. . My Dad went the opposite direction and was quite hungry and did the  license to grill.  To which he ate in silence.  He just dug in and enjoyed the combination of sausage, chicken, ribs and something else I'm sure.  He didn't finish it all, but took some home and they made sure he had enough bbq sauce to take home cause that's some of the best part.. . We are Parrotheads so we will also stop by, but whether we just drink or eat always depends on the quality of our experience, and each year we have had wonderful service, great food, and great great.  So until next time Fins Up!
Food and service is always high.  Place is almost always hopping from breakfast til closing.. I would swear, however, that the quality of their margaritas have gone downhill in the last few years.  I know their method is pretty simple but their best was too sweet and not great.  Maybe I just had a bad bartender or 3 while I was there but it was nothing special.
