This was my first visit. I was there forlunch on a Saturday. Let me break it down.. . Service: The host was pleasant and accommodating when, right after he seated us, we asked to move outside. It was such a nice day. He had us sit by the outdoor fireplace while they cleaned a table for us. Our waiter was friendly, and a random waitress asked if she could turn our table around so my husband and I could sit together, rather than across from each other. . AND the manager (?) gave us free baked goodies from brunch!. . Food: I had the pork chili verde. It was tasty and the cornbread- moist and sweet. The highlights were my husband's Moroccan meatballs and his cherry, almond soda. I don't even like soda, but I drank all of his. SO good! We asked if there were cinnamon rolls left from brunch for dessert. The server was told there weren't but said he would check anyway. He came back with a cinnamon roll the size of my head smothered in caramel. It was melt-in-your-mouth heaven.. . Atmosphere: Great music and intimate- inside and out. I'm excited to go back for dinner, because I bet its beautiful on their patio at night.
Met a group of people here for Happy Hour and it was so worth it! Servers are friendly and efficient, food is excellent (try the pumpkin soup!!!!) and their HH prices can't be beat!  Even thought the place was 3/4's filled (it was Halloween night), the place isn't noisy at all and you can carry on a conversation. Highly recommend!
We love this place for Sunday Brunch. However, they ran out of coffee mugs. A place of this caliber this should never happen. I know this is a small thing, but It's thesmall things that can make the difference. The food however is still awesome. Staff are great. I hope this isn't the beginning of the decline of one of my favorite restaurants. But for now I still highly recommend St. Francis.
We don't know if we are somehow jinxed, but while we have had a favorable opinion of the food, the restaurant cannot seem to connect the dots with service.  Tonight was a prime example - a relatively quiet Sunday evening around 7:30.  We sat at the bar and placed our order for dinner.  The soup and bread came out uneventfully, but it went downhill after that.  The waitress / bartender brought out my entree, the Risotto, and instead of what my partner had ordered - their pork chop - she brought out the pot roast for him  Then she proceeded to tell us that she had punched in the order wrong, and added that they were out of the port chops - this after I had my meal in front of me.  We were ready to walk out of the restaurant at that point, and then a chef came out and suddenly advised us that they were not out of pork chops.  Knowing that the chop is cooked on the entire rack from prior visits (hence "the limited availability") we then knew that either the waitress and/or the kitchen had initially lied to us to foist an unwanted entree item on us.  15 minutes later, after I had stalled in eating my meal so I would not be finished before the other entree arrived we finally had the second meal.  All in all, the night was a very stressful and unpleasant ordeal.  Several visits earlier, our entire dinner order was "lost" - this after we waited for 40 minutes after finishing the soup.. . While the food has generally been pretty good, the service level will take this restaurant off of our list, which is a shame since we live only a half mile away, and like to support allof the neighborhood establishments.
Great food and atmosphere.  Staff is great, prices are reasonable.  Very nice addition to the neighborhood!
Packed for Happy Hour.  . . Breakfast on the weekend rocks!!  Try the Cinnamon Rolls - bunch of goodness!. . Some severs have attitudes but there are some Awesome ones too.  Service does need to be worked on.  There is a lot of people during peak times. just jump right in. Food well worth the visit bit a bit pricey.. . Fun people watching!
My third visit here, not sure if I'll make a fourth.  After a lot of attempts we finally made it here for their brunch menu.   My mother had been wanting to try their skillet pancake after seeing it on Food Network.  I was looking forward to having their Eggs Benedict with salmon again.   . Our service with Ryan was good.  We had a couple issues with our dishes though.   A side order of bacon that we'd requested as "crispy" was not, and the skillet pancakes apparently are not made fresh upon ordering? There was some ore made in the kitchen visable from entering the restaraunt and when served they failed to come with the cooked apples and whipped cream on top.  We had to ask for them and server then noticed they were bare .  After all the anticipation it was less than stellar.  My eggs Benedict : eggs were cold and although poached, they were very undercooked still.  The inside whites were visably raw and watery.
One of the best restaurants I've been to in Phoenix. The food was spectacular. The service was world class. Although I only had a few items on the menu, I would be willing to bet every single item is off the charts tasty. Great ambiance and don't forget to watch DDD before going!
I love this place. The space is eclectic and the staff is exceptional at customer service. I enjoyed an afternoon hanging out at the bar taste testing new cocktails and chatting with Angel. The owner is personable and continuously works the room chatting with customers and pitching in with food and drink service. He leads by example and his team reacts well to his laid back style.. . I had a Mexican style meatball dish from the Thursday night Happy Hour menu and delish heats of romaine salad on my second visit. It is worth the venture out of the downtown core!
Although I didn't have a full meal while at St. Francis, I have to say I loved this place. The service was phenomenal and our server was the friendliest person ever. I really enjoyed the simple/modern decor and ambiance. I stopped by St. Francis for Happy Hour and really enjoyed the Mezcal Mule which was a cocktail that consisted of sombra mezcal, gosling's ginger beer, cucumber, agave & passion fruit. I had a cheese flatbread and although simple and with few ingredients, it was delicious. Can't wait to go back to have dinner!
Great atmosphere, great food, kids eat free, excellent friendly wait staff, what else can you ask for?
Went for breakfast with a couple of foodies, when I arrived they had a delicious cinnamon bun waiting for me, great for sharing and very tasty. I ordered a frittata and a Bellini, everyone else got green chili skillets which were amazing. My "frittata" consisted of a paper thin piece of overcooked egg and raw veggies on top. It was inedible. When the server came by, she was oblivious to the situation, never asked if we needed for drinks or how our food was. When the bus boy came by he grabbed the untouched plate and there was no mention of this foe frittata ever again. I was very disappointed in my food and the service, but luckily I have friends who share well. . . Not writing it off completely, but definitely avoiding the "frittata".
I loved this place! Ambiance is great and the food is really consistent across the menu. I'd recommend the roasted cauliflower and the pork green Chile (cornbread was terrific). The meatballs were good but there's a ton of cumin in them. Also really liked the side salad.
This restaurant has a creative, tasty menu and very pleasant atmosphere.  We had a group of four that sat outside and feasted.  We started with the goat cheese appetizer, and it was amazing, probably my favorite dish of the day.  We also had the roasted cauliflower that my companions raved about.  For entree's, I had the Moroccan meatballs, an excellent choice.  My companions had the pulled pig sandwich, which was good, the risotto, and the definite winner of the the day, the pork chile verde with two eggs on top.  That dish was simply amazing.  Also, we tried the caramel toffee pudding, half of us loved it and half of us left it; it is very sweet.  One caveat, this is not a business luncheon place:  service is very, very slow.  We were at leisure, so it was fine with us, but this was a two-hour lunch from the time we sat down until we paid out.  But if you have time, go for the goat cheese appetizer and the pork chile verde, I will!
I had the eggs Benedict w/avocado, daughter had the kids pizza, & my husband had the American breakfast. The food was okay - I would say that the breakfast items aren't spectacular. The potatoes are different, but good. I had to add more salt & some pepper because I felt that my dish was a bit bland. The hollandaise sauce didn't give it much flavor. The service from the servers was a bit slow but they were friendly! Our bill came out to be $30 so for us it wasn't worth coming back for brunch. However, we're willing to try it for dinner especially since our toddler can eat for free. That's what earned them the third star.
My friends and I came here for lunch last week.  I was in town for a short time,  catching up with old friends. They had complimentary valet parking and the staff was very friendly.  We had the first table when you walk in the front door.  It was nicely designed restaurant and very homey and inviting.  This restaurant is very kid friendly, they have a box of toys, and Kids under 10 eat for free.  . . My two favorite dishes was the Roasted Salmon Superfood and the Pork Chile Verde.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection.  The veggies and the quinoa in the Superfoods were delicious and paired well with the Salmon. The Pork Chile Verde was so delicious.  My friend ordered this first and let me try a sample and then after my Salmon dish i ordered the Prok Chile Verde.  I don't normally like Chili but this dish flavors was so on point and it was delicious.  I ordered two dishes for lunch, both were amazing and made super happy!  . . I will definitely will come back if i ever visit Phoenix again.  I would definitely go if I had kids under age 10, they get to eat for free! That is amazing!  Thanks for the good food and awesome service.
