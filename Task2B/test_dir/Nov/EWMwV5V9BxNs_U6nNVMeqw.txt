LOVE this place for its Mediterranean-influenced food.. . Try a kisra, which is essentially a flatbread pizza. I love the gyro kisra---the gyro meat is flavorful and juicy; the bread is herb-y and delicious; and the salad that comes on top is really lemony and refreshing.
This place is incredible. I got the Eggs Benedict Sunday morning and it was one of the best meals I've had so far in Phoenix. They do it on french bread with a side of roasted potatoes and greens. They top the eggs benedict with roasted tomatoes for a really unique taste. I eat eggs benedict everywhere and this is definitely at the top of my list. If I lived closer I'd go to FEZ every weekend.
Seriously good food, but the wait staff is a bit slow both in taking orders and in checking back in. I've been both on busy nights and slow days and both were the same, lots of time spent waiting to order and then get the order. . . However, the decorating and ambience are very nice and, as I said, the food is excellent. I've tried their Strawberry Blueberry Cashew salad which is amazing, the FEZ burger which is equally amazing and a myriad of other things as well. All of the food is amazing, but if you go, be prepared to flag down a wait person when you need something because they likely won't notice until you've been waiting for a while otherwise.
Trendy and fun spot to eat and drink. Everything is so good at Fez for any time of the day. I was pretty surprised by how differently delicious the salads were...I mean, come on, when are salads ever worth paying for at a restaurant. Definitely worth it here. . They always have great daily drink specials, and the waiters have always been amazing.
I crave the Casablanca sandwich (chicken, goat cheese, cranberry sauce, magic, and unicorn hair) regularly!! That and their 4 (yes four!!) types of fries! You can get any large basket of fries with two types so just do yourself a favor and get two large baskets, all four in there. The FEZ burger will also never lead you astray along with te black bean!. . On top of the delicious food, their kitchen is open way later than most, and the servers ooze love and peace and happiness. I went with a giant group on first Fridays and they were more than accommodating and even split all our checks!! I love fez!!
I dream about the FEZ burger! Over all I really enjoy this place and it's priced well for what you recieve. The only drawback is sometime the service could be better which is why they get 4/5 stars, but don't it deter you from their tasty food.
Hands down my favorite casual brunch or date night spot! The Fez burger with garlic rosemary fries is amazing!!! My drink of choice is the g spot. I'm there so often that a few waiters know my order by heart. Trust me, you won't go wrong with Fez! If you see me there stop over and say hi!
Came in for lunch with my aunt around 3pm, it was a bit empty but to be expected since we missed the rush and it was before happy hour. . . Ordered the pesto ceasar with Chicken which is my absolute favorite, I also wanted a sangria and although it wasn't on the menu our waitress said she'd ask the bartender and they made us the drink!. . The food was awesome and the service was great too! our waitress was such a sweetheart and really tried to make our experience pleasant. I can't wait for the new location to open on Central (where Portland's used to be) because it'll be a bit closer and it's supposed to be bigger too!. . I also like going to Switch, the food is always good and I like their staff. Keep doing what your doing! it obviously works :)
Love the atmosphere. GREAT waiters a waitresses. They love to talk to you and they are so friendly. The drinks and drink specials to amazing as well. Holla Tini Tuesday!!!!!!
This place has a great 2002 vibe. Unfortunately, it's over a decade later. Food was okay. Service was pretentious. Music was sad. Overall, update or die, guys.
