I won a free stay at the Mandalay so I was so excited to go but i waa apprehensive about how yhe service maybe since it was a comped stay but much to my delight they were fantastic! They took excellent care of us. Everything was beautiful and it was a great get away!! Can't wait to come again.
Called to find out how much to get a suit pressed - it was like pulling teeth to get the info.  They kept referring to alterations, just on pants, etc.  HOW MUCH TO PRESS A TWO PIECE SUIT?. Restaurant couldn't seem to understand the request for cocktail sauce with oysters.  They brought ketchup.. The mini-bars are NOTORIOUS for having magnets or weight sensors, so if you touch anything it might appear on your bill.
Fantastic property. Very luxurious, excellent service from everyone. Beautiful views of Vegas from the rooms. Close to the action. One of the better casinos on premises. A couple of cautions. On property restaurants are VERY expensive and not always great. And there was no coffee maker in the room, so it meant a 1/4 mile walk to Starbucks every morning. But all in all -- two thumbs up.
