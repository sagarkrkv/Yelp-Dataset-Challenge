The combination pho, fried Egg rolls, beef and Broccoli and drunken noodles are all excellent!!
Great stop after the club. Open 24 hrs! But why am I not surprised...vegas never sleeps! Long line to get in but we didn't wait too long. I got the combination pho that hit the spot but I felt like I had more meat than noodles.
Last day in Vegas .. Tired , fat , and hungover .. We wanted to go get some soup to "burn off the grease" in our system. Dumb of us to come eat greasy pho but at the moment it made sense. . . Made our way to a strip mall a little off the Vegas strip. Tried the small #15. Pretty decent. Broth was superb but the noodles were a bit off for me. Not horrible though. Can be fixed with the right ratio of siracha, limes, cilantro, bean sprouts, and jalapenos. Began to work my magic and soup was delicious. . . We ordered the fried Calamari as appetizers for the table. Amazing. Must come back for these. Its the traditional calamari but with a Asian twist. Loved it. Portions were pretty generous as well.
While visiting Vegas I wanted to give this place a try since I have friends suggesting it  to be one of the better Pho joint in town.  Unfortunately I can't seem to agree. The broth is what makes it or break it. It was dingy broth and all I tasted was salt. The meat wasn't fresh and the little amount of noodles that they gave was over cooked. Just didn't do it for me. :(
Seriously, what a disgrace to pho!! If you want less than mediocre pho with awful service, this is definitely the place for you!  . . First of all, it's in a plaza with like 90 other stores. And they mostly cater to the Asian community. So imagine a tight parking lot filled with Asian drivers. Yeah, you get the picture. . . Next, it's always so busy in there. There's no room to wait while you get called for a table, so people are forced outside. Fine if it's spring time, crap if it's in the middle of summer or winter. . . There's no warmth in the service. Idk, maybe it's just me, but if I'm going to sit down at a restaurant, I like the server to chat a little. Even just a smile, a "how are you?" would be nice. Nope not here. They hurdle you to the table, take your order, bring your food, then your check. Good luck trying to get someone's attention if you need something extra. On my last visit, it took about 10 minutes to waive someone down so I could put in another order to go. I see this place as a fancy fast food pho joint.. . Now the food. The egg rolls are pretty typical. They are fried so you can't really mess those up. Pho broth is on the oily side, like you can see the oil floating at the top of your bowl. Noodles are stuck together like they've been waiting in the bowl for broth to loosen them up. My last visit I ordered seafood pho and it was so gross. The seafood was not fresh at all and had a fishy taste. And the squid tasted like it was on the verge of expiring. Their smoothies are pretty tasty, but stay away from the boba. It's mushy at first and they get hard as it sits in your cold drink.. . The only thing they have going for them is that they are open way late and can cater to the night crowd of Vegas. I don't eat here by choice, only by the choice of others. I'd much rather drive the few blocks down and eat at Kihn Do.
Very disappointed!!. One of the worst service i ever experience. So incomplete n rude waiters
The only reason why this place gets three stars is because the food is actually really good, and it's nice to have a 24 hour pho restaurant. However, the service is absolutely HORRIBLE. It's very poorly managed, the servers are quite rude, and wait times between being seated, sitting down, ordering, and getting the check is ridiculous. I'm not sure if I'd want to go back.
After seeing all the hype and long wait at this place, I do say, it is worth it. Our food came out pretty quick and was delicious. I've had plenty of different pho places and this one defiantly takes the cake. I have to make a stop here everytime I'm back in Vegas for business.
Be prepared to wait even if it's 8:30 pm.
Worst service I ever had! Served us water didn't care to ask if we wanted anything else to drink. As we ordered our food, they were mean. Never again will I go there!
I ate here with a family friend and her mother to celebrate her mom's birthday. . . Ugh, unfortunately, I have to say that the folks that run this place ought to be ashamed of themselves. . . I already had a bad taste in my mouth even before walking in after seeing the large banner advertising that this establishment is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas. . . We waited approximately ten to fifteen minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad after hearing of the epic wait times for a table here. . . It wasn't worth it. The pho was extremely unimpressive, with a cheap tasting, salty broth that rendered my friend and me overly thirsty for the next twelve hours. The rare meat tasted as if it were "improperly aged," as I like to term it, and was not fresh at all. Honestly, if it weren't for the dish's soft tripe, I would have given this place a one-star review. . . The pork chop that my "aunt" ordered was greasy and dry at the same time. I didn't think that was possible. It seemed like it had been recooked twice over. . . To add insult to injury, the basic tea was priced western-style at $1 per person. I'm sorry, but this place does not qualify as Asian due to that pricing structure. Tea is part of the dining experience at any formal Asian restaurant. . . The service was cordial but average. . . All of the above being said, if I were to give this restaurant some advice, it would be to remove that silly banner. If you need to advertise that you are the best, it means that you clearly aren't or you already had plans to reduce quality and/or cut costs.
Yea after numerous times coming here I'm gonna give them 5 stars for the consistent good food and always VERY GOOD service, i mean its not a fine dinning establishment but its as good as it gets for this type of place, I think the owner/manager is always around at all hours and he seems to know how to run his restaurant,  i have such a hard time with service at ethnic restaurants but this place has it down.  Everything I've tried has been fantastic, i don't think ill ever try the whole menu but I'm pretty sure its all good based on what i have tried.  Good job Pho Kim Long!!!
Still the best place in town to get great food with great company. Ive been going here since i was 10(im 25 now) and its still my most favorite place to come for lunch dinner or that late night shift. The service is awesome and the people i still remember as a kid are.still here. Keep it up :D
So me and my friend decided to stop into this place and have lunch together... . Me and my friend both decided to start off with appetizers.. Me ordering the calamari and my friend ordering the chicken wings... . However when the calamari came it looked as if it had been sitting in Grease all day, and was not yummy at all.. And then when I told the server that I didn't like it, he did take it back but the other waitresses really rude about it.. Busting out loudly saying what is wrong with the calamari that me and my guest heard it from across the room... . Not very good customer service if you ask me.. She then proceeded to our table and asked me personally what was wrong with the calamari and I may have been a little rude but I told her it was disgusting and she got mad and walked off.. . . However my friends chicken wings are pretty alright.. Then our food came my file is really good I ate the whole thing... . So besides the yucky calamari and the rude lady my experience was alright but I would never come back again!!!. . PS. I even left a $20 tip
Literally best place. Everything was delicious chowmein , pho & steak yum yum yum ! Will be back soon !
I'm not able to eat pho anywhere else because this place has got me hooked. I always order their #14 Rare Steak Noodle Soup, great broth, but I am Mexican so I add a lot of lime and a few squirts of sriracha sauce and some jalapeno slices. But I can't just order only pho. I as well order their crispy eggrolls and crab ragoons, both very delicious and worth looking like a pig in front of everybody.. . They are always busy no matter what, especially weekend nights that u might not find parking in the entire shopping center, it has happened to me before.
They have these tofu nuggets that are just delicious. Even if you don't like tofu. I always order the spring rolls I just think they're a nice light appetizer. . . Obviously it's a Pho place, so let's get down to the Pho. I love it here. The broth is incredible, I kind of drown it in siracha and duck sauce but before I do that the taste is great. . . I love that they offer a vegan pho it means I can drag my roommate here and she will have something to eat.
Best pho I've had so far, been here twice in one month, and was not ashamed to go alone. Lol. I love how you are automatically served water right when you are seated. It's always very busy so I thought that was great. I always order the Pho Vegan, and it it excellent! Great flavor. The tofu nuggets are very good as well. They also serve brown rice! Which many Pho locations don't, (like the one I'm at right now) it's 24 hours which is also a plus, I was on the strip late night and wanted something light and they were my first option! Will always come back here!
Items ordered:. . Pho tai: tasty. . The regret: 3 buns for $10. - braised pork was so tiny and all fat. - they will push that item on you. STAY AWAY!
This place is always busy and they are open 24 hours which is always a plus especially in Vegas. I ordered the spring rolls, egg rolls and the pho special. Delicious.!
24 hr Pho!  HELL YA!  And it's hella good!  I've been sick as hell lately...4am can't sleep want soup....perfect!  And I was sitting at my table and All the sauces and such were full with not sticky nice clean bottles and the waiter hushly came to table removed the plate of sauces so all my bottles were filled to brim. Kinda unexpected great service!  Get the large bowls cause the regular size doesn't have enough noodles makes u need and want more...so good so perfectly made!!!
Very good restaurant, the service was fast and the food was delicious. I love pho and it's hard to find a very good pho place and this place definitely better than any other pho restaurant I've tried in Vegas.
When the weather is getting colder, I come here to have dinner with family. They have one of the best pho in town. I had my first pho back in Sacramento, introduced by my hmong friends. Eating here reminds me of my 2nd home. I miss cali.
The best pho I've had in a while. Another 6 out of 5 stars, unofficially on this one. I'm having a lot of 6 star meals these days.... . I feel like you have to go off the strip in order to get good authentic Asian food, particularly pho. And you will definitely need your pho fix after a night of drinking! It's definitely one of my favorite hang over meals...I loved the flavor of the soup, and the meat quality wasn't sucky like a lot of other places.. . Since we had a group of girls, there were a variety of other dishes that were delicious. Since it's been a while, tho, I can't really remember each dish...but here goes:. . There was a stir fried udon plate that was really realy good. Actually, it's one of the dishes that we took back to the hotel, to-go...and later had as a midnight snack. I know, gross right? But hey, it was perfectly fine!!! No tummy aches.... . We ordered the pea shoots for our veggie dish, and it complemented all the other dishes so well. It really helps to have a veggie dish to go with the meat-y, rich dishes.. . The calamari (or maybe it was fried squid?) was nice and crispy, with lots of extra crunchy flakes on top. We probably over ordered here, but at least we got to try a variety of dishes!
This place has really improved within the last year. Their service has dramatically improved. I am assuming that this place has recently gone under new management for the better. The food is still delicious and in my opinion does not need to change at all. I will continue to be a customer.
I agreed with Marie T. Food is ok, but the service is definitely the WORST!!! We ordered wonton to share between my husband and myself as a soup for starter. The waiter brought out the wonton bowl as big as a "pho bowl", so I asked the waiter for a small soup or rice bowl to spilt the soup up. He said, "ok". So we waited and waited and waited... Nothing. Another waiter came by, I asked for the same thing...again nothing.
Service is absolutely terrible and food is average. Server has a really bad attitude from the very start and is very unresponsive. We asked for bowls and they took our chopsticks away... For the pho, noodles are overcooked but soup is good and not oily. The udon is really oily though. Overall, the bad service destroys the eating experience and puts people in a bad mood.
Food taste great but for some reason i dont like how they give service to guest due to that they are always in a hurry and it feels like they dont want you to order more food, especially when you're pretty hungry and want to eat a lot and try some other menus they have, dont even have a time to think what to order, but still food taste good, prolly go back again hut i recommend to check the menu online and prepare it already before going...hahaha
