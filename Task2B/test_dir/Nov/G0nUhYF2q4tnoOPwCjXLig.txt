I recently stayed here on one of my layovers on my flight back to hawaii.  I often stop in Las vegas and usually stay on the north side of the strip.  I ended up finding a great last minute deal here and thought I would try it out.  I loved my stay.  The hotel is close to the airport, my room was clean, and the location was nice.  But... the reason I am writing this is because of the biggest reason why I loved my stay:  . . GILBERTO!!!  He was the lovely man that checked me in!  He is the cutest thing ever and was so welcoming and sweet to me!  He was professional but also welcoming and social and really just a breath of fresh air!  It is because of him that I decided to stay again on my way home.  I travel a lot with work and I will now be using Excalibur as my bi-monthly stop because I loved his service so much!  For the record, he wasn't working on my second stay and the lady that checked me in then was also amazing and super sweet!  I wish I remembered her name so that I could give her credit also!. . I just hope that if the managers/owners read this that they let Gilberto know that he is doing a great job!  While I am writing this review, I am 100% certain that I am not the only person that feels this way.  You guys have a winner with this one!  I hope you are treating him as well as he treated me!  . . See you all again soon!. . Tara
tacky? yes! but the whole of vegas is all about being tacky.. but for the price i think its perfect... it's got everything you need and more... the service was good and was even upgraded to a nicer room, so i can't complain too much... their are better hotels for a little extra money but hey at the end of the day as long as its safe and clean then all you need the room for is to sleep in as most of the time you will be out partying along the strip...
The first time I stayed in Vegas, I stayed one night in the Excalibur and decided I'd return because I didn't see a point in spending so much money on a hotel room when I'd never be there. The second time I visited Vegas (most recently), I stayed at the Excalibur for five days. What a mistake! . There's no WiFi here and I really could have used it for business a few times while I stayed. Sorry, but my iPad doesn't have a huge port for a jack on the side! . No coffee machines in the room?! Even the cheapest hotels I've stayed at have something that will produce hot water! Come on, people! . Beds sucked. I guess the first time I stayed in Vegas, I really was just too intoxicated to care about the comfort of my bed. Not this time! Woke up sore just about every morning! . People were constantly harassing me and my friend to go to these timeshare conferences for free tickets. GO AWAY. . Let's just say I had my fill of Excalibur and will not be returning. Next time I go to Vegas, I will shell out the extra money for a DECENT room.
Good location on the southern edge of the strip and near the airport. Rooms were outdated, but as nice or nicer than what you would expect from a budget hotel stay. It has a full complement of amenities and appears to have a lot of facilities for children. . . The only complaints I have were that there was no master switch to turn the bedroom lights on (you have to turn on the lamps individually) and that there was no wifi in the rooms. It's ok to have an un-renovated bathroom and a low-end atmosphere: that's all fine when you're looking for a budget option. But wifi and a ceiling lamp are sort of the least one can expect from a modern hotel.
Hum, how was my stay?  Well I booked third party and am actually glad I messed up because since my event didn't work out, I was able to check out without any hassle.  I did wonder why the hotel still felt the need to charge me then refund me when I checked out early.. On to my stay....check in was easy.  I booked online so there were no complications there.  Isabel (front desk clerk), she was great.  Pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable regarding any questions I asked.  Even when she had to tell me no, she was always polite about it.. I go to my room.  Open the door....the most musty stale smell ever!   My first thing, check the bed for bugs or anything weird.  No bugs, but I did find hair...and lots of it!  I go to the bathroom; same thing...way too much hair & it wasn't even mine...it looked like a mixture with dog hair as well.  I call housekeeping.  Some rude chick named 'Brenda' and says "we'll get there whenever because we have more people ahead of you".  I say okay & go talk to the manager (her name starts with a T).  She was pleasant.  She even gave me some extra accommodations and fixed the issues I had with my bill.  All pleasant attitude and helpful.    They change me rooms and I still find eyelashes and a few hairs in my bathroom, but after a 6 hour drive, I just end up saying forget it.. This hotel seriously needs an upgrade tho....the internet IS NOT WIRELESS!!  I literally had to plug my lap top in....so if you are an ipad, tablet type, no internet for you.  The resort fees are a bit much especially for things that should come with the hotel...who pays to use a gym while on vacation....the TV doesn't have any hook ups, no HDMI, no USB...so you won't be watching your own stuff and there are no cable channels!. A few good things; there are a lot of restaurants inside and places to eat with variety.  So you can get practically anything you want inside the hotel.  I ate at Bucca....very good food.  I'm not Italian so I have nothing to gauge, but I like what I eat there.  The service is quick and the utensils and plates are clean.... The gambling is decent....no huge jackpots, but I didn't feel totally ripped off.  I would say all and all, my trip there was okay, but I probably would not book at the Excalibur again.
Definitely check out Dick's restaurant downstairs! When the evening/night hits, make sure to carry your ID with you if you leave your room or good luck trying to get back up. McDonald's and Dunkin Donuts is open really late in the building. . Located somewhat on the end of the strip and the pool is nice.
Don't stay here unless you really have to. There is no internet wifi in the rooms, they give you a short jack to put into the side of your computer... too bad I only had my ipad. Not to mention that the TV channels suck. I would't complain about that if they just had some stinking wifi! I mean why make me pay resort fees for such a shitty hotel? Last but not least, there was a bug in my room my last day I stayed and never been back since. Save some extra cash and go elsewhere.
Loses lots of points for having HDTVs in the rooms, but they are hooked to a standard-def cable system- and on top of that, the TVs are set to STRETCH the 4x3 picture making everything look short and fat, and the controls to fix it are locked out! Why not just stick with an old TV if you can't bother to have HD cable or at least a regular antenna hooked up?. . As has been mentioned before, no Wifi either. Wasn't a problem for me as I could plug my computer into their internet jack, but some devices don't have that option.. . Room itself was decent for the price. But don't play the slots there, you can't win!
Want to go to a free show?  Honestly, I was asked that at least 50 times in two days.  It was so bad that I had to find a different casino to gamble.  The rooms are alright, but I wasn't planning on being in the room that long anyway.  Food was good at the steak restaurant .  . Charges for room is misleading.  Huge resort fee above the advertised price.. Next time to Vegas I plan on taking myself and my gambling to another hotel.  They made an extra $40 on bogus fees, but lost out on the $1000 I lost at a nearby hotel.. Won't be going back to what use to be my favorite hotel in Vegas.. . Ps. Do not do a late check out.  Something like $20, so u think.  Then u get ur bill and see resort fees tagged on.  My previous day room charge was cheaper than My late check out.. Sad things are so corrupt!
We almost always stay here when we visit vegas. Mostly because it's affordable for us cause how much time do you actually spend in the room?? Why pay 200+ a night to stay in the room for a few hours?! It's nothing fancy, pretty simple, a little old looking but always clean when we go.  Just a place to sleep and shower and have a little fun
i stayed here recently it was very pleasant and the staff is very nice and accomodating. If you are on a budget this place is perfect has alot of fast food choices and located at the tip of the main strip...all you have to do is cross the bridge and you are at new york new york. The only thing was the regula m lige was closed when i checked in...i went to the other mlife and then checked in gotto my room.l, the keys did not work and there were pink panties on the handle, the nice security guard openes our door and there was a huge stain in the carpet, we went down they changed our room and etc our whole check in was pushing two hours to get settled in.
The room was clean and that is really all I need in a room. . . However, since this is a "resort" on the strip I did expect more. which is why I only gave them 3 stars. The "Free WiFi" advertised, is only available in the casino and there is an Ethernet chord in the room. I brought only my phone so that didn't help me at all, who does that in a hotel? I have a complete understanding that certain charges are not within the hotel's control, but a resort fee should cover certain resort type of amenities. For example, WiFi, shuttle service and the like. Neither was really complimentary so it was kind of a bummer. A vacation is best spent out on the town, so obviously these things didn't ruin my trip, but they are certainly meant for conversation.
This place is a disgrace.  You can see that this is a horrible place as soon as you enter the hotel.  All the employees there are trained to generate revenue I guess.  . . On my first day I asked one Nigerian employee about the Buffet and he showd my how to get to the Buffet place.  I went there only to find out that the Buffet was closed for renovations.  This dude was only interested in selling the show tickets and he did not care how he treated the "Guests".. . The room had no coffee machine and no wifi.  The bed was good though.. . Please stay away from thisplace!!
This is one of the worst hotel experiences ever. First of all the room is outdated the furnitire smelled old, looked about 50 years old, and the dark ugly carpet was stained and torn and had cigarette burns. No wifi. Also their staff constantly bugs you offering tickets for shows etc. I would never stay here again.
Really good hotel if you love cigarette smoke. A lot of families seem to stay here - presumably because it's cheap. I suppose these are also the same families that come to Vegas and end up eating at McDonald's. . . I stayed here for 3 days free using MyVegas rewards points and still felt cheated. The bed and pillows made my neck hurt, the air made my nose bleed, and seeing parents bring their children during a school day made me weep for society. To be fair, the latter isn't Excalibur's fault. Just an observation.. . Do yourself a favor and save up money to stay at New York New York if you're looking for an inexpensive hotel. But if you must stay at Excalibur I guess you can rationalize it by telling yourself at least it's not The Quad.
The Excalibur - in all my years of going to Vegas this is one of the few places I haven't been into - it is a larger location, has a lot of families staying here due to the cheaper room rates, and the kid-like attractions. . . The casino is pretty large and can take some time to navigate, especially if you are trying to figure out how to reach other hotels if you are crusing through on your way to the Luxor or the New York New York across the street. The casino floor is also more smokey than some of the others - which makes me wonder why people would want to bring little kids into this particular place. . . I usually end up just passing through on my way to other hotels in the area and you might find yourself doing the same....
Well, just stayed there over the weekend and you get what you pay for.  If you want a cheap hotel on the strip,  this is it.  Dont expect anything fancy.  This was a classic room, one tv with basic programming, normal bathroom, two regular noisy beds, out of date furniture and that's it.  I didn't like that you could hear almost everything and I mean everything from the room next door thru the room connecting doors. This is basically why I gave a three stars rating.  I think the hotel could do something better to improve this.  The fire sprinklers looked rusty,  I assume these get tested.  Sorry but I just couldn't keep the 1980 MGM fire out of my head.  We did see improvements on the Fun Dungeon area, my kids loved it. The staff was nice and helpful.  The "want a free show" people are kind of annoying. We probably heard that at least 20 times a day. Most likely will look for a different hotel next time we go to Vegas.
I stayed 3 nights at the Excalibur Hotel in Las Vegas, NV on 11/21/2014, 11/22/2014 and 1123/2014.  It was the first time that I stayed here.  I stayed in tower 2 which is newly renovated.  My bill for the roomwas just over $300 total for the three nights.  I love the medieval theme of the Excalibur.  Plus, I took photos.
EVERYBODY is here right now. For the budget & kids, this is the spot though! There is plenty PG-13 things to do within Excalibur, MGM Grand & New York New York. Put on comfy shoes unless u hitting the club cuz you will b walking.
11/28/14 my husband and I decided to stay here to bring our daughter for the first time! However, we thought the experience would have been a great one, well, it was ok... When we checked in, we had great customer service from the reception check in area. After that, not so much! The next morning, we had called for house cleaning service as we headed out for the day, we came back after 2 hours later, and the room was still not cleaned, ok, we had to get ready for Dinner, after dinner and a night out, 6 hours later, we come back and still, room was not cleaned!!! My husband called them and their response was they were busy! Cleaning service came at 1am and cleaned up. Other than that, all was great, and not to mention getting approached 100 times "how long are you staying here, let me show you"!?!?! Uugh hahaha, I had to lie and say each day it was my last day or I was a local so these people would leave me alone! The BEST PART WAS THE STEAK HOUSE OF CAMELOT!! And just the lil food area makes a perfect area for a quick late night snack! Over all it ok, but I think we'll stay somewhere else next time:)  !
