Old school. Grimey. Entertainment and sleaze.. . Came here on a Saturday evening stroll, the first eye-catching sights could be either the street performers, peddlers persuading you to buy their merchandise, or the giant LCD screen stretching across the large street as a ceiling. . . Another thing worthy of trying out would be the zip-line that stretches from the start to the end of the street!. . It's definitely worth coming here to kill time with sight-seeing, old-town vegas vibes, and feeling like a part of something 'bigger', haha.. . Shows on the LCD screen start around 6-8pm until late night, or so I've heard. . . Make sure to pick up plenty of cheap, random goodies at the side shops :)
FSE has become a very touristy sideshow/carnival like walk-around with street performers, artists, and the like. In many ways, it's true to the original spirit of Fremont Street's no-shame casinos, especially with girls dancing on bars, and the like. They do have some surprisingly good bands play for free here, so check the calendar for when you're visiting. . Don't expect an elegant experience. It's lowbrow fun, take it in that spirit. If you're up to it. Slotzilla may be the most unusual zip line experience you'll ever have.
Now THIS is the Vegas I was waiting to see. The lights, the VERY interesting people, the sounds - you'll walk down this casino-lined street and the words "only in Vegas" will pop into your mind at least a dozen times. It's a little sketchy and sleazy and it is definitely not the same Vegas as The Strip, but that's what makes it awesome. For a people watching experience like none other, make a trip to Fremont Street and get a taste of old Vegas.
I was warned by a nice lady of the following: dont walk down freemont with an open container. Its a big ass ticket. Be warned my fellow man.
This review is SOLELY BASED ON MY LAST VISIT TO FSE!!!!! It wasn't so many years ago that I wanted a cheap room in Vegas and the cheapest we could find was at the Cortez, right at the beginning of downtown's transformation into what would eventually become the Fremont Street Experience. This place was deserted. A ghost town. Unless you consider scaffolding a resident. The Irish pub was the only thing that had any life to it whatsoever. Fast forwards a few years later, and FSE became the beautiful not so hidden gem that it is today.. . FSE holds a special place in my heart because I have gotten to see it being built into what it is today. I've been able to take my children with me on FSE to watch the many wonderful and talented street performers and the people dressed as characters working for tips, and it has always been a fun place to take a stroll in the evening, bouncing from eatery to eatery and bar to bar while zigzagging in and out of the casinos to play in between people watching and drinking.. . Sadly, on this last visit, this past Marine Corps birthday weekend, I was unfortunately reminded that this was not the FSE I had grown to love. By no means am I a prude or sensitive to nudity of any kind, but I didn't like what I saw this time around. Before, there were plenty of handsome and beautiful men and women dressed like Spartans and showgirls and sexy Disney or fairytale creatures, super heroes and so on and so forth, but on this particular evening, the streets were full of women baring their breasts, nipples covered with electrical tape of all things, trying to get tipped just because their titties were showing. . . Fat men, renting super hero costumes, trying to get tipped for being Superman and Spiderman with their beer bellies hanging out. Dude, I know men and women are beautiful in ALL shapes and sizes, but come on, look the part at least. What made me the saddest was that one of these women was older, and heavy and missing her teeth, and probably very much in need of money to either support a family or a habit, and there she was being made fun of just to earn a couple of dollars. Why? So that some drunk ass twenty something could get a good laugh and a pic and her an extra dollar?. . I hope that whoever is in charge of the FSE can somehow regulate the quality and quantity of street performers and tip seekers there are out there, because its getting a little out of control. I can see FSE possibly going downhill from all this extra traffic. Some of these performers were actually a little pushy and seemed pissed that you didn't want your picture taken with them! I'd like to go back to the old days where I'd be able to walk down the streets of FSE with my lady and drink in hand, and enjoy the awesome bands performing on stage in peace and not be harassed by tip seeking caricatures of characters. PLEASE DO SOMETHING!
Wow, FSE is a must see in Vegas, but leave the kids at home if you are going after dark. . . A great place to people watch as well as see the light show, and some great free shows on 3 different stages. Stayed 3 nights and spent them all on Fremont Street. Country music going on one stage, old time rock and roll onanother, and the show not to miss is "The Fremont Street Hotties" on the far stage next to the Nugget. Beautiful ladies, although scantily clad dance, sing, and play with audience putting on a great show. One of the gals Alissa I believe does an aerial  show that is unbelievable. . . Go at night to see the light show as well as the street performers come out of the woodwork. You see showgirls, drag queens, Pirates, construction workers, indians, playboy bunnies, mr. T, kiss, Michael Jackson, topless cops, topless Angels, body painted ladies, singers, dancers. A little of everything. . . A zip line runs the length of the light show from slotzilla, to the nugget.
Hadn't been here in many years. Not since they called it this and built that canopy over it. Kinda weird seeing the cowboy from the old Pioneer Hotel all under it. Used to drive by that as a kid, now...no cars allowed. . . I was here to judge the World Food Championships, as they were being held literally in the middle of the Freemont Experience. All the kitchens were out in the open for everyone to see and it was a really good time. . . But what a fun and yet creepy place! Reminds me of Times Square in New York. It is definitely entertaining and all the characters....ummm....I mean tourists make it a fun place to keep returning to instead of the chaos of the strip where everything is too spread out. Besides, if you've done the strip, this is a nice, if not a bit of a grimy change of pace. . . All the surrounding hotel's slot machines pay off better than anything near the strip. And the hotel prices are cheap, cheap, cheap!!
You've got to come here and see the lights and people.
Very different from the newer part of the strip! You will get a real feel of what Vegas really is lol. Free/ live entertainment bums and crackheads! It's a whole different world on this street and I personally think it's more fun then doing things on the main strip or whatever! There are a ton of things to do and see my sister and friend got there palms read lol. Live paintings which was really fun to watch besides huffing all that paint! Haha bars,casinos ,shopping, zip line. People doing weird things for tips and live bands shows and food! Just check it out if your around and never been :)
A wilder, brighter, cheaper, more fun version of The Strip! There's plenty to see and do while you walk along Fremont Street - street performers, musicians, quirky characters in costume, food vendors, bars, and an amazing light show on the canopy ceiling every hour at night.  You stop by a casino, catch a bite, or find better deals on souvenirs than you possibly could at The Strip.
Kind of cool. Kind of crazy. There are a lot of freaks. Freakmont Street is not really a place to bring little kids. There is a lot of nudity. A lot of unusual/freaky people. Very interesting though.
FREE FREE! Since we went kids ( had to take them!) Good light show , decent street performers ( depends what you want to see or want your kids to see), you will see everything batman, elvis to street bums around. Of course every few minutes you look up to see the zipliners/zoomliners. . Many scantily clad performers on stage /bars,street. Also the visitors sometimes are very creative in their dressing style for example there was an older lady with 2 strategically placed stars.It's Vegas what else :)
Mainly came for the zip-lines, which was awesome!. You get your picture taken towards the end that you can buy. I think it was about $25-30. You can either go laying down or sitting up. If you laying down it cost more. Near the entrance there is a store you have to purchase the tickets in. . .  The whole thing is under a tent. They have a few different stages for live music. Some rock and some country music.. . Lots of people dress up as movie characters or shows girls ( like most places in vegas); beware, they do charge you. I see it happen a lot, They get you to take a picture then expect you to give them money. . . Lots of restaurants including the famous Heart Attack Cafe and Pizza Rock.Pizza Rock is pretty new. Totally worth trying!!!!  Most of them have seating outside. The bars are outside and you have live entertainment there; dancing girls. Later in the night they got music playing and you can watch the giant t.v. screens on the sealing.. . There is a few places to gamble. . . Much better to go at night. You really get a much better experience. I recommend  taking a cab and walking the rest of the way. There is not much parking. Depending what hotel you are at its about $22 from NyNY/MGM hotel on the strip. . . Guys, I would keep your personal belongings in your front pocket. Ladies just bring what you need and not a big ass purse. Watch your things. always check your pockets. . . Some people come over a period of several days. Honestly, I think you can see everything in a few hours. . . This is a must see place, but there is so many things to see in vegas, especially if its your first time here. Don't waste it all on Fremont. . . Really nothing for kids except the zip-line....
A walk on the LV feral side! Come here for Excellent people watching,  quality look alike street performers, amazing overhead TV/Projection/Light effects, live stage performances, and even zip-lining!
