Had the ramen a while back, when they first open. It was very busy and we sat at the counter. . . It was the same today, very busy for late lunch. I didn't expect a wait list but we put our name down and waited, no too long around 10 minutes. We sat at the counter!. . We ordered the gyoza, the pork belly bowl, the chashu bowl, spicy tonkotsu ramen and the shoyu ramen. It was all very good, the broth was perfectly blended, warming the noodles through and the pork belly bowl is worth a repeat, it was top of my favorites list! . . Service was great, food was great, now that cold weather is upon us, this may become a welcome spot!
Talk about authentic! I  am from Hawaii and we love our food! We have a substantial Japanese population that kept the old school style cooking and we also have the new generation dabbling with Fusion dishes. I can say I love both. A bit surprised at the comment made a couple back from mine. I would say maybe her taste buds need coaxing to enjoy a good meal. . . As for the pork belly dish, my grandmother made the best and this is pretty comparable to hers. And that's a huge compliment.. . Thumbs Up!!
Great food for a great price.  Fast excellent service.  It is almost always full but since service is fast you can just wait and seats become available quickly.  All parties must be present to be seated.
Omg I'm so full and my tummy is happy :) I recommend starting with the kimchi fried rice it was very good and came out quickly.. Although our ramen didn't take long at all either.. We did wait to be seated because we got there at prime dinner time.
We were in vegas for the Sema show, looked up the best ramen and this ramen house came up.  All four of us agreed.....it is the best!  We had all the ramen options and loved them all.  You can order them hot or regular...both ways are totally yummy.  Fried rice if good but order it light oil.  Pork belly bowl is bomb.  We ate there 3days out of 5....it was that good.  Options get expensive though.  Enjoy!
THE BEST RAMEN I'VE EVER HAD.. . Portion sizes make sense also, you eat a small bowl of the best quality Ramen, and you go home without the usual, "OMG I'm going to hurl" feeling you get from most ramen places.
Simply the best! The only place in Las Vegas that I could give 5 stars to. Only place that comes partly close is Fukumimi Ramen.
Excellent ramen recommended by locals.  Very glad we went. Surrounding area is maybe a bit foreboding, especially since they don't have a clear sign like the rest of the shops in the plaza but once you find it you won't regret the search.
Just ate here and it was seriously the best ramen I've ever had, definitely. And for a great price! Seriously, for a standard bowl of tonkatsu shoyu it was like $7. . . It was very filling, might I add. . . But, point is, the staff was incredibly kind, the service was incredibly speedy, like blow my mind speedy, and the food was impeccable. I will be coming back. 10/10
This place was the second ramen place I've been to in town and I wanna say it was really good! I got the Tonkatsu shoyu with sea weed and egg. The broth was spectacular! And the pork was so tender....it melted in my mouth.  The only reason why I didn't give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because they didn't have dessert:/ not even Mochi... Maybe next time:)
Very delicious Kyushu Ramen in America!. Like I eat in Japan.. You can go by ride or 203 RTC
Wow. Just wow. I wish I could give this place an even higher rating. The reviews and recommendations really show how wonderful this place really is. The first time I came here was also the first time I had ever had ramen. It was a Thursday afternoon around 3:30-4. I was looking for a good local place with ramen as I was with my family and it was my dads suggestion we try ramen. We went to a place on the same street about 3 blocks down. The place was EMPTY I mean not even a single car in the parking lot. After doing some research on yelp I see that monta ramen is just down the street and was high rated with lots of reviews. We checked it out and it was packed! On a Thursday afternoon that really says a lot about the place especially when another similar place so close was completely empty. We waited a moment for a table to be ready as this place is kinda small and does not have much seating space. But do not be deterred by this! It is worth the wait. The waitress was very nice and recommended the pork/chicken broth combo which she said was the most popular. I was sooooo impressed. I can't describe how delicious. I've gone back twice and it has only been 5 days. Mind you I also do not live close by.
Winter weather leaving you feeling cold? Me too! . . My old staple for cold weather comfort, like many others, is Pho. In light of something new I decided to try Monta Ramen. This place is definitely worth a try! . . Very cozy, small place, serves up a limited menu of fried rices and reman soups. I had the Kim chi fried rice -the egg and the flavors were amazing. . . Also has the tonkotsu ramen and that was a very hearty filling soup.. . The downfall from this place is the lack of a vegetarian option soup. This is usually a must for me. Feeling the cold disparity I opted for the chick and park broth tonkotsu ramen and gave the pork that came with my soup to my boyfriend (obviously this was a plus for him ) . . I neglected to notice the specials board, or rather the server neglected to tell me about it, but next time I'll be trying their Spicy Tonkotsu soup. Would have given this 4 stars, but sometimes the attitude of the servers is a bit shaky. Also, sitting at the counter near where the door opens isn't the greatest either.
Super small joint. I had the tonkotsu with thin noodles and the hub hub had the spicy ramen with thick, wavy noodles. . The tonkotsu noodles were pretty thick for being labeled "thin", which works out for the better because I prefer thick ramen noodles. . The first time we went here I thought it was one of the best ramen I have ever had but this time, though still good, it isn't the best. . With that said, for the price you can't beat it!
Bowl full of yum!  It's a small place with reasonable prices and an uncomplicated menu. Good for small groups as it's a small venue. Worth a try :)
Im not the biggest fan of asian style noodles, but the noodles and broth here are closer to what ive tasted to dishes made for me from people that are from japan or lived there than any other ramen spot in town. The layout and atmosphere is closest to what its like in Japan according to my friends from Japan. . . Monta has the best fried rice, and the best gyoza of any style asian/japanese restaurant in town PERIOD. My only complain is the meat they put on top of the ramen bowls is small.
This is a MUST every time I'm in Vegas, & I've been here 3 times this year already.  It has definitely taken over the typical hungover comfort food, Pho.  Their broth is rich & the salted egg is so good with it.  The meat is always tender & I can never finish my bowl.  My boyfriend always has a big appetite so he also get the bowls as well, he loves it but I feel it's more of a dish to order on the go.
This place is awesome., The Gyoza are delicious and the Shoyu Ramen was as good as noodle soup gets.
To date, my favorite ramen spot in Vegas. Small location so there are always wait times. But the flavor and quality of the ramen is stellar! Very reasonably priced. Everything you order is prepared fresh as your order is taken. Go here! Trust the fat kid
This place has over 1k reviews so I was pretty stoked to try it out.  I have to say it's OK.  . . We pretty much ordered each type of ramen they have here.  The broth is fairly tasty and the noodles are pretty good but it was SALTY.  I drank 3 glasses of water while eating my food.  I don't know if they make fresh noodles here but I know I've had better noodles.. . However that soft cooked tea egg, PERFECTION.  That really made my ramen so much better.. . If you come here be prepared to wait since it's a tiny restaurant.  Luckily it moves pretty quickly but I would not come here with more than a party of 2.. . *For Vegas standards, maybe this is the best out in the area.
Monta Ramen, a top ramen restaurant in Vegas, provides good food, but it is not worth the long wait. Although the nitamago (soft boiled egg) had a great texture, it was bland and lacked the distant soy sauce flavor. My friend's spicy tonkotsu ramen had pork with great proportion of fat and meat; yet, the soup was not spicy by all means. I recommend going to Monta Ramen at 11:30 a.m., its opening time, in order to avoid the wait.
We had lunch at Monta Ramen. If you are in Las Vegas, you've got to visit this place. The food quality is awesome, and the price is excellent. The ramens are less than $7 per order. I actually find the fried rice and pork belly bowl are my favorites. Make sure to get there early because the wait list can be long. But the serving speed is very fast so you won't end up waiting for long.
I'll make this short and sweet. Hey, that's the perfect description of our waitress!. . We arrived on Friday night, between 6-7PM to a full parking lot, but a slow night over at Monta Ramen. We found street parking, got our name on the list and probably sat around 7 minutes after that. The bar top was packed while the main area had a steady flow of patrons ordering, dining, enjoying then leaving. Seems like standard operating procedures, so let's do it.. . I ordered the Spicy Tonkutsu Ramen and our table shared the Takana Rice. Literally, our ramen showed up within minutes.. Seems like they might have it sitting stove top somewhere. It took longer for our rice to show up, but it was definitely worth it. The rice was tasty, as are most fried foods. Fluffy and moist with bits and pieces of meat, egg and dashes of spice. . . As far as the ramen goes, there was a taste I can't quite describe.. it wasn't necessarily bad nor was it good. What saved the bowl, in my opinion, was the fact that they include a little sriracha style chili sauce which blended well in the broth and masked that indescribable taste. That, along with garlic and a dab of soy totally turned this dish from a 3 to a 4. The spice level, out of 10, had to be in the 5 or 6 zone. ALMOST had me, but it was more of a flavor than the actual kick. The ramen noodles were a little thin making it truly easy to finish this bowl off, which I find hard to do in the SGV area due to the portion sizes.. . This wasn't necessarily the best ramen I'vehad to date, but having the wind gust hard outside along with winter like temps and an empty stomach, it definitely did the job.. We didn't have to wait in a dreaded line, super-friendly service, decent prices, prompt ticket turnaround times and the meal was quite fulfilling.
I was here to meet my friend and glad she did. This small place is known for their delicious ramen and for bargain. The ramen was so flavorful as well as the broth. My favorite part of the dish was the pork belly and egg.. . We also ordered gyozas which I can't remember how it was like so it proves it wasn't anything special.
Components of a good bowl of ramen:. 1) perfectly cooked noodles (some prefer slightly chewy, but I like mine a little softer). 2) well-balanced, flavored broth. 3) attentiveness of toppings . . Monta Ramen's Tonkotsu would have been THE PERFECT bowl, except it only passed 2 out of 3 of my criteria.. Great noodles, good chashu, but the tonkotsu broth was waaaay too greasy and rich. It got to the point that I had to dump water from my cup to dilute it down-- [gasp!] I know, what blasphemy! . . Had I known, I would've gone with the shoyu or miso.
Why are all ramen shops in Vegas small and cramped? That's besides the point because I am willing to wait for good ramen, but I was pretty disappointed by Monta on a recent visit. The toppings were too basic. It wasn't a surprise that the flavor was lacking when you only have a few components. You get two small slices of chashu and a few bamboo shoots. The tonkotsu-shoyu broth didn't have any depth of flavor. I had to ask for a second helping of noodles because the serving was so small. I didn't like the thin texture of the noodles. My friend asked for extra chili sauce for his spicy tonkotsu because it lacked the kick he was looking for. They said it was $1 extra. If your broth isn't spicy enough and you want to charge your customers extra, shame on you. Plus, 75 cents for nori? At least that's included at Sora. The best part of the ramen was the soft-boiled egg.
Tiny hole-in-the-wall joint in a strip mall featuring a variety of cheap, delicious Asian mom-and-pop eateries.  I'm not going to say anything that differs from what my other yelp colleagues have said; I will concur with the majority in that I found Monta Ramen's enormous bowls of steaming, savory goodness satisfying for the body and soul.  For less than $10 a bowl, anyone lucky enough and patient enough to snag a seat (no reservations; you sign your name on the queue list and temper your impatience) will be rewarded with yumminess that will live on for the rest of the night.
Best Ramen in Vegas.  I'd really want to rate this 4.5 stars, because the service is at times a bit rude, but the food is probably good enough that I can rate this 5 stars.  I come back frequently, always order the tonkotsu ramen with an egg and extra pork, delicious!
Wow!  And OMG!  Authentic and delicious! Totally satisfying - very tiny so be prepared to wait! But it's so worth it! And did I mention this one won't cost you a bundle- almost felt guilty it didn't cost a tad more- noodles and beer- less than $12!   Do not miss this place!!!
