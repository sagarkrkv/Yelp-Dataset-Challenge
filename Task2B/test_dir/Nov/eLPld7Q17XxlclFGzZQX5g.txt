Yama is great. I was a sushi mon fan but yama beats them hands down. I love all their specialty rolls and they satisfy my eel cravings. Their Misu soup is excellent and I have never had a bad experience there.
Best shushi in vegas ....I just refuse to go somewhere else. . I really recommend to all
Went here today for my bday and it is absolutely excellent. Service was great and food was even better. I was probably here for around 2 hours and the sushi was fresh and fantastic. A bit cramped when full but will definitely come back for more.
My favorite sushi house and only just down the street. Gotta have those man whore's and the palm job is to die for.  I love coming down here with my friends and family. I always refer them to here when ever I can.
Great food at a great price. AYCE with high quality sushi. . . Unfortunately our crabby, sourpuss, downright rude chef (Paw) ruined my meal by being such a disrespectful jerk. I have no idea why. . . Try getting a job you like!
Wow. We were sitting at Paw's bar tonight, too. We thought it was us. Guess it was him afterall. We like Sasa Sushi on Cheyenne and Buffalo better. A FRIENDLIER, more personable atmosphere.
Best AYCE in Vegas.  Salmon and yellowtail collar, seafood salad, great tempura, quality nigiri for a ayce, bomb diggity rolls, good service and chill sushi chefs.  What else can you ask for, if yelp had a 6 star option, this place would get it.
Did someone say AYCE Fresh Sushi? Sign Me up right now! This Spot is amazing if you love fresh sushi. You have the ability to order any style of sushi roll From the menu all under the AYCE menu price! A group of us sat at the sushi bar and watched the head Chef make some incredible rolls. If you are vegas this is a must hit.
Came highly recommended. Roach climbed up wall behind while eating toro. Didn't seem to bother anyone else.
The sushi has very naughty and creative names. Good all u can eat price for dinner $23.99 . You can order anything on the menu. We order Sake and it did take a little while for it to come but very worth it.
Good sushi with a great price. Only reason I'm giving it a 4 star is because the portions have to much rice for the all you can eat. The fish is very fresh and I recommend any one who lives sushi with a big appetite.
Rolls were decent.  Place is busy which wasn't a problem.  Took about 20min to get seated.  Pretty good time.  Service is chaos.  Found it funny the waitresses weren't named, but numbered.  They forgot 2 of the rolls we ordered.  The table next to us had half their order forgotten.  Other than the price im not sure if we will rush back.
Love this place. Great variety of sushi and sashimi rolls, prices are very reasonable. They also have all you can eat for $25 so you can try a variety of things. The names of the rolls are humorous, they have the traditional sushi and sashimi but they also provide you with a great variety of specialty and custom made rolls.  Food is always fresh and quickly delivered,  however service could be a bit friendlier and more personable.
We love this place. Its a must stop when we are visiting. We use to live in Las Vegas but now reside in Portland Oregon where they don't have AYCE.. say whhhaaaattt. I know CRAZY. but that what makes visiting this restaurant even better. This visit was on a Sunday night with 7 other people. A Full restaurant at that. but they service is always great, it was good this time.. we had a couple dishes we didn't order placed on our table. Then we noticed one that had been on our table for about 20 minutes and the waitress took it and gave it to the table behind us.!! WHAT?! now that was just terrible (what if we sneezed on it, which we didn't ) but not okay with any of us. The price for AYCE dinner is $24.95 I believe. Staff is all friendly. The Restaurant is clean. Always a line out the door/people waiting outside for a table. Good sign right?!. I would say if you like sushi this is a place to go!
The wait can be a bit long some days, but it's worth it! One of my favorite AYCE sushi places. Cozy atmosphere, good service, and some pretty amusing names for the sushi rolls. Best to go with a group of 3-4 people to mix and match and optimize the AYCE experience. Don't forget to save room for dessert! The green tea ice cream or various flavors of mochi are a perfect way to end the meal. Roughly $25 for dinner and a soft drink. Not too shabby.
The last time I left a review for Yama I had only been there twice. I've probably been to Yama now, 10 - 15 times and I am never disappointed. The service is great. Even on a busy night, I get my sushi in a reasonable time. My favorite rolls are the spicy sexy role, happy ending and wet dream. There are so many options at Yama. I would definitely recommend.
Love this place we go there every time we have sushi.,. Took my son for sushi for the very first time ,and he's pretty picky eater .. Aways has good service , clean eating area.
This place is amazing. The price is great, food is awesome, and service is super fast. I randomly found this place last year, and as a visitor to Vegas, I hate paying strip prices for quality sushi. But all you can eat for $24?! Yes, please! Normally all you can eat sushi is crappy rolls, but this is premium stuff here, so it's well worth the money. Definitely a must eat if you're looking for great sushi but don't want to pay $200 for two people.
Why do I even bother eating sushi anywhere else in Vegas? I'm always disappointed because nothing compares to this place. . . Their ingredients are fresh, the sushi roll combinations are unique, service is quick, and the AYCE is a great value.. . I recommend the Seafood salad specifically, but you really can't go wrong with anything you order.
Yama sushi MMMMMMMM.  This is my 2nd time ever eating sushi. Did 23 dollar all you can eat.   Totally worth it. Had way more than 23 dollars worth! Sat at the sushi bar and it extremely quick service by the chef . They make it to order right in front of you! Kinda neat watchin them whip up everyones food so quick and efficient . We went on a saturday night so we had to wait about 15 mins for 2 of us.. Larger parties had to wait longer that were there ahead of us.. Food was excellent and i thought the price was good. Cheaper if you go before 3 pm.   Go in hungry! You won't regret it! Oh yea practice using chopsticks because we did not see a fork anywhere!
I tried Yama today because of the sheer volume of positive reviews, but I wasn't impressed. I am a nigiri girl, so my review is just for nigiri. The quality of fish was good (not great), but the cuts were ok and holy moly rice... I felt like I was eating starch for days.. I couldn't even taste the fish cuz there's so much rice!! They're a bit understaff so it takes a while to order and for your food to come. The Mexican lady is also a bit rude when you ask her about things on the menu. I think if more people know about Sakana across the street they would not be so busy. Sorry Yama, think Sakana's got you beat in quality and variety.
Affordable all you can eat sushi! $25 dinner with sashimisalad, soft shell crabs, mussels, shrimp tempura and unlimited sushi rolls. Plus Mochi ice cream for dessert!I highly recommend Yama Sushi.
Overall 3.5 stars. . Gold medal - sweet shrimp . Silver medal - uni. Bronze medal -  gyoza. . If you are looking for sushi then sushi coma is better.  If you are looking for rolls, the rolls at Yama are really yum.. . The sweet shrimp at Yama is really good.  It is large shrimps and they fry the head.. . The uni was fresh and super creamy.  The gyoza was very crispy and tasty.  . . Super long wait, so try to get there early.. . Happy Sushiing!!
