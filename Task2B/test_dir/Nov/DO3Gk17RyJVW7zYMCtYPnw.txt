Located in Cesar's Palace on the famous Las Vegas Strip. Ok so it's a little expensive, but the menu is quite inventive and everything is fresh (the fish and seafood is flown in daily). I recommend making reservations as it can get packed, but if you do have to wait, make sure to try a margarita or three at the bar. I should mention that the service is always great here. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
I don't know why, but I'd always been reluctant to try this place.  . . Maybe it's because it's so close to the casino floor?  . Maybe it's the bright colors?  . Maybe because I kept thinking it was a Mexican restaurant, realize it wasn't when I actually *was* looking for a Mexican restaurant, and it just wasn't on my radar for steaks/meat?  . Maybe because it's sort of in no man's land where it's too expensive for a casual meal and not really in the upper tier of fine dining restaurants on the strip?  . . Regardless, I finally got around to trying Mesa when it was a friend's choice for dinner.  . . Took a little hunting to find something that really stuck out on the menu to me.  No doubt it's just personal preference, but quite a few items on the menu seemed to have polarizing experiments, meaning they'd start off sounding great before having a deal breaker ingredient I don't care for.  I'm not usually a fan of substitutions or trying to alter a chef's creation.  . . When I did finally decide on my meal, it was very good.  Much better than I was expecting.  Portions are on the smaller side though, and I wouldn't put Mesa in the top tier of restaurants on the strip.  . . 3.5 stars rounded up from me.
We came here last Thursday and this was the best lunch I've had in a while. I was pretty food happy after this visit and maybe a little sleepy too lol. I feel really bad that I forgot our server's name because he was super friendly and definitely not stuffy or high-nosed like some servers at higher end places. . . Peach Magarita:  I don't normally like Margaritas because I prefer sweet or citrusy drinks but I really liked this one. It tasted more like a white sangria because there was barely any sourness so I enjoyed it.. . Pan Roasted Shrimp: This is the one I ordered and it  came with creamy green chile rice and smoked chile butter. The flavor was amazing and shrimp was big. It was also the perfect size since it was on the rich side. I could definitely see myself craving this for a creamy seafood fix.. . Green Chile Cheeseburger: My boyfriend ordered this one but as usual I tasted it too lol it was a perfect medium rare and was very tender and juicy. It came with a slightly spicy queso sauce, roasted poblanos and pickled red onions. Yummm! . . Southwestern Fries: These came with the burger and were the best fries I've had in a while. Super flavorful and whatever you do, ask for a side of peppered mayo. Our server asked if we wanted some so we were like sure, why not. I was expecting well, pepper in mayo lol  but what we got was this tangy zesty sauce and it was soo good that my boyfriend even put it on his burger.. . Now let's talk their Chocolate Cajeta Cake with vanilla swirl ice cream and salted chocolate crunch. I am in love. Head over heels in love. My boyfriend is rolling his eyes while I'm saying this lol but really. I am warning you though, this is sweet tooth craving to the extreme. It was almost a little too sweet and rich for me after the first few bites but I am the type of person that will choose chocolate over any savory meal any day. Soo if you're chocolate monster like I am, go for it!. . We will definitely be back to try dinner and most likely for lunch again as well! A+ for Mr.Bobby Flay.
Santa Fe, New Mexico has raised our expectations when it comes to Food.. Tiger Shrimp tamale : bland and salty. New Mexico rubbed chipotle pork: Ham flavored and lacking sauce. Lamb chops: Very flavorful .. Second or return visit. No!!. Service was top notch.
My husband and I have had lunch here twice.  On our first visit, we were totally annoyed with the waiter who apparently did not want to accept the fact that my husband and I did not want cocktails with our lunch.  He repeatedly asked us about drinks and we repeatedly said, "No, thank you."  We ordered an array of appetizers for lunch which were all quite good.  When they arrived, again he brought up the subject of drinks and suggested a special margarita and said we could split it if we wanted to.  Split a drink?  Seriously?  We were not being cheap (just the array of appetizers built a pretty hefty tab) and are totally aware that when in Vegas you shell out the bucks for what you want and we have no problem with that.  We tried Mesa again on a visit last October and were relieved that this time we didn't get the cocktail hard-sell.  We both ordered the barbecued lamb cobb salad.  Our waiter felt the need to mention that the lamb wasn't really barbecued but more on the grilled side.  So, why not call it the grilled lamb cobb salad?  Not a deal breaker.  The salad was tasty although a bit mushy due to the guacamole in it.  Why not just slice or dice the avocado and keep the salad a nice consistency?  Can't say I just can't wait to get back to Vegas to go to Mesa Grill again.  We do say this about meals we have had at Todd English and Wofgang Puck where you get great quality and bang for your big bucks (after all, this IS Vegas). What I can say about this last experience is, "Bobby, please bring me the rest of my salad!"  The portion was incredibly small (about a cup full) to have been served in such a large bowl.  The large container only served to make us wonder where the rest of our salad was.  This item needs to be moved to the appetizer section.  If lamb is all that expensive, would it have hurt to at least throw in some extra greens to bulk it up a bit?   The good thing is that all during the rest of our trip, we kept laughing about this salad experience.  Bobby, we still love you but we don't love Mesa Grill!
Talk about a consistently solid meal.  Mesa Grill continues to impress and leave me with a satisfied meal.  My favorite dishes are the Pork Tenderloin, Rabbit, and Coffee rubbed steak.  The Lobster Tacos are awesome to start with, and the margaritas are excellent.  I had a craving for a couple weeks to go back to Mesa Grill, so Mr. Riches and I went there with the team.  The others at the table ordered the Veal, and they also enjoyed that.  However, the consensus was that it did not compete with the dishes I mentioned above.. . If you want a reasonably priced meal, that won't take forever, stop by Mesa Grill for a bite.
I have been to this restaurant at least 3 times. Consistently delivers great meals over the years. If I am in Vegas I go here.
I had the lamb chop (medium), very delicious and perfectly charred. Southwestern corn is probably the best thing on the menu, I wish they shipped it. . . Great ambience, perfect service, and over the top mixed drinks. The only downside, Bobby wasn't there ;)
It was good, I would go back.
Mesa grill is one of my favorites when I go to Vegas.  They have awesome food and the servers there are also awesome.  They take the time to go over specials and explain what items on the menu tastes like (on the night I went, it  was super busy). . . Drinks:. . The servers were raving about their margaritas, but I opted to get a dessert wine and got the weinlaubenhof kracher 08 ($16 per glass), which was very sweet, so if you're into that, must try!. . Appetizers:. . Blue corn lobster taco ($20). I basically like corn, so getting this taco was a given. . . Baby romaine salad ($13), there is nothing that stands out about this salad and tasted generic, so you can save yourself 13 dollars and order something else. . . Entrees:. . Their 22 Oz bone in chipotle glazed rib eye ($48) was spot on.  Since it was a large piece of meat,  I opted for well done,  but slightly pink.  This turned out to be amazing. The meat was so soft and tender and it held in the juices and flavor very well. Also, to top it off the red and green chile sauce pairs perfectly with the slightly smoked taste of the meat. . . Mango tuna steak ($38) is a fun little twist to your average steak. It had fun flavors like peppercorn, and pine nuts, cous cous to top off your steak. Can't go wrong with a little twist if executed right. . . Desserts:. . Brown butter carrot cake ($11) The cream cheese was so soft and it came with caramelized apples. It wasn't too sweet, but just enough to fulfill a dessert craving.. . Churros ($11) come topped with cinnamon sugar and chocolate/coconut caramel dipping sauces. The texture of the churro did taste a little hard, but unsure if it was just that day or that's the nature of how the churro is made.
Finally decided to write my review for this restaurant as I am just sitting here at work thinking about the oh so delicious hot smoked salmon club I've ordered when I was in Vegas. . . Great food + great service = happy girl. . . What more can I ask ??  I came with a bachelorette party (about 10 total) and we had great service. . . This club consisted of avocados ( I loveeeee avocados! ) tomatos, bacon, and chipotle aioli. Also came with a side of fries. . . I ate half of it because I was going to a pool party and didn't want my stomach bulging out like the night before when I went to eat at a buffet. Oh man I learned my lesson - I was too full to function. But that's a different story. So I was hoping to eat the other half when I wanted some drunk munchies. . . My cousins ordered burgers and other items and they all loved it.  . . This sandwich was so good that when I came back drunk from the club, all I was kept saying was "I want my sandwich" over and over while stumbling and rolling on the bed, according to my cousin. . . I can't wait to come back!
This is one of my favorite restaurants. The pork tenderloin is fantastic and you must not pass on ordering the lobster tacos as an appetizer. The duck appetizer was great as well, very rich so best shared with someone. The house cab is a great choice of wine. The food has so much complex flavor the wine should be simple and enjoyable. My dinner companion got the Chili Rellano and was not overly excited about it. Will be back next time I am in town. I recommend you make a reservation at least a few days ahead.
We went in around breakfast/lunch time in November and the atmosphere was nice. We waited a little bit to get seated and the place had high ceilings, cool decors, next to the sport bar in Caesar's Palace. . Service was excellent, coffee was soo good. Till this day I still think about it. Wonder what coffee they've used. The complimentary bread had an interesting mix of muffins, cheese bread, and something else. But the little cheese bread was awesome! We've asked for more. . Our burger and fries was cooked perfectly and the smoked salmon was also excellent.  . We were thinking the bill will be crazy high but when it came we were surprised of how decent it was. Much better food and price than other higher end restaurant in Caesars. . Good food, good service, good deal = happy customer. I would definitely come back for more.
Stopped in for an early lunch. It wasn't very crowded so I was expecting a little faster service...it wasn't terribly slow just not what I expected. . . I had the shrimp tacos. First, I was a little surprised that it was "build your own taco", but whatever. The shrimp were cooked fine, but they were over seasoned and so instead of flavor I just tasted sodium. The cabbage slaw topping was really tasty and the condiments were fresh and tasty. The bread basket was very good, especially the jalapeno bread.. . The price was a little steep for essentially 6 shrimp, some cabbage and bread (I just had water for drink) ...30 after tip.
OMG this had to be one of the best meals we had while visiting Vegas! Every thing was exceptional from beginning to start... For our lunch We ordered pretty much everything on the menu...Standouts would have to be the shrimp tamale and the pan roasted shrimp with the rice! It was sublime... Also the French fries that came with the burger were awesome! Perfectly fried and crispy... I'm forgetting about the queso Fundido! It has goat cheese so it deterred the table a bit but I read it was a must so we did and it was Super delicious! To drink everyone has a cactus pear margarita which was my favorite from last time and I had a cactus pear tea... Which was good and I like the fact they give you a simple syrup type thing as a sweetener... Just look at my pictures... They speak 1000 words right?! With all the many different restaurants it's easy to miss but you shouldn't!!
Out of all the highly rated restaurants I've been to in Philly, NY, NJ, Dallas, and Oklahoma. This is my favorite restaurant ever- mainly because of the food. We got the: . . Appetizer: . Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale- The Tamales had the most delicious sauces infused into it. . . Entrees: . 1. Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops (medium)- Perfectly cooked and very well seasoned with very bold flavors. It was spicy and I loved it!. . 2. Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin Bourbon (medium)- ancho chile sauce sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. It was tangy and the sauces perfectly complemented the meat. . . Dessert: . We got the chocolate cake? (don't remember what it was called): It was layered date & chocolate cake with a salted chocolate sauce, a crunchy rice crispy garnish and a scoop of Vanilla ice cream - VERY VERY Good.. . Pros: . The price compared to the other high end restaurants in Vegas.  . The Food! was perfect.. The ambiance is great for small parties. . . Cons: . I went there with my wife for dinner and we were lucky the seats next to us emptied out not too long after we got there or else it would have been cramped and included in the conversations around us.
Fan-freaking-tastic.. . I loved my meal at Mesa Grill.. . I sat at the bar and the bartender was excellent about taking care of me with refills and such.. . I had a Patron silver margarita and thought it was perfectly mixed.. . For dinner, I ordered the grilled chicken ($30).  The hot red pepper/garlic sauce on this thing was incredible.  It came with outstanding cilantro pesto mashed potatoes.  I think I licked the plate clean.  . . I'm chipping off one star because $30 is pretty steep for half a chicken and some mashed potatoes, but food is always pricey in Vegas.. . I've eaten at a lot of terrible places in Las Vegas.  But I'm adding Mesa Grill to my list of go-to dining spots.
At the beginning i was surprise with the presentation and transformation of mexican food to the trendy concepts. We ordered Yucatan chicken skewers and unfortunately this dish did not bring even the half o the Yucatan uniqueness and tasteful cuisine. For entree we ordered ribeye with chile ancho sauce with brussels sprouts, Anaheim chile relleno and blue corn tamale, the tamale was crap!, dry and lack of flavor, the brussels sprouts as nogada style was just ok. The meat was just ok not the highest quality. The coconut flake very cheap, lack of excitement and flavor, the pumpkin bread pudding is just ok, looks more like a deconstructed s'more . Bobby Flay you really disappointed me! All the critics about your food at food network was made with people lacking in mexican cuisine experience. Thanks forusing mexican food but you need to keep learning.
AAA quality food! True fine dining experience. Will definitely come back to try again
Had Ana as our server.  She was smart and attentive.  Made great recommendations and indulged our silliness.. . Lunch time "Death by Appetizers."  Instead of ordering 3 entrees we ordered 4 appetizers and split them between us.  We started with a few margaritas,  I had the Cactus pear and my my had the one with pureed peach and agave.  Delicious and smooth and just right with the food and atmosphere.. . For our appetizers we had the shrimp in the corn tamale... We ranked this our favorite of the four we order.  All of them were great but to rank them the tiger shrimp tamale should be an entree.  My second favorite was the duck.  So sweet and tender with a mild heat.  Then there was the the queso fundido.  So oowee gooey with red and green peppers and chillies so warm with a bite.  Mmmmmm with long strips of blue corn chips.  The last was the tuna nachos.  Bright and fresh with contrast from the capers.  A delight with several sauces that add some heat, served with yellow and blue corn chips.. . Once again a fantastic experience, this is one of the few restaurants that we go to every time we visit.
This is a great spot for food that is filled with flavor and nuance. I highly recommend the duck pancakes,  tuna nachos and both the mushroom and chicken quesadillas. The apps beat out the entrees and all the dishes have a unique flavor combo. The ambience is so so and that's why I withheld a star, it lacks comfort and warmth. Overall, a good spot for a twist in southwestern flavors.
Why is it that a table for 2 always get stuck in a corner with the smallest table possible.  And to boot, all tables had a white table cloth except for the tables for two.  I'm giving the food 4 stars and the seating 1 star.  For the amount of money we paid for the food, we should have had a table cloth.  Come on Bobby.  Slightly disappointed
We were told that we should give this place a shot for brunch upon our arrival at Caesar's Palace so we did.  We were very interested in the twist it had in breakfast/brunch foods so we were sat down and given a chance to look through the menu and they had some different items.  I even took a chance to look at Yelp to see what some of these inventions were.  We ended up ordering the spicy scrambled eggs and the sweet potato hash.  Both were really good and we enjoyed our meals. Would recommend.
Sat at the bar on a Sunday night. Margarita was very good.  Be sure to add Grand Marnier;) I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered the Ancho Chile Glazed Salmon.   OMG sooooooooo good. Cooked perfectly medium rare and bursting with flavor. I originally said no to the house bread basket but the couple next to be insisted I get it.  Good advice.  Its an assortment of different breads, but the one the stuck out the most to me was the blue corn muffin.. . All in all I was impressed. Service was prompt and the price reasonable considering the name and location of this place.
