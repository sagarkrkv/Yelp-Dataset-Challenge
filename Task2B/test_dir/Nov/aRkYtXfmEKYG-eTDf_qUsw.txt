Hip and casual with great lighting for a morning nosh and tasty espresso.
One of my favorite places near home. Great for any occasion.  Excellent coffee, drinks and food. Great atmosphere.
First off I love the food, it's always tasty and just as I ordered. And the coffee - delicious, never burned. My only issue with Lux is the staff. Don't get me wrong, I have yet to walk into Lux when they are not busy. How ever, what happened to service with a smile? I always feel rushed once I get to the register to give my order and they generally have a crappy attitude. It's hard enough to find a place to sit so make it easier for me to go back by being nicer!
Been awhile since I visited but wanted to give them some mega praise. Best Mac & Cheese I ever had. Loved watching World Cup games there too this summer. Wonderful place. I'll be back for sure.
Enjoyed our visit to Diamond Knot.  Brittney was a great server - friendly & very  efficient.
Today I road bikes with my girlfriend to this little trendy coffee located in Central Phoenix that I quickly fell in love with. There was a variety of choices of drinks, breakfast sandwiches and pastries to choose from and everything looked and smelled delicious. There was plenty of parking and seating both inside and outside. The service was very good considering the place was packed with customers, which speaks for itself!  I will definitely be back again to support yet another great local spot:)
First thing I need to say is...To all the douche bags that left one star negative reviews about this establishment.  Do us all a favor and stay your ass at home. Assholes like that have no right to be in public. Now on a positive note me and my husband came here for our Sunday morning breakfast. We got the pumpkin choclate chip muffins, the fruit and granola yogurt cup. Also got the oatmeal with seasonal fruit and walnuts. For drinks my husband got a medium dark roast coffee and I got the medium black and white mocha. Everything was great including the service. The place was very busy and the service we received was fast and friendly. They had a dj playing music and the atmosphere was pleasant. I highly recommend giving this place a visit. I know we will be returning again in the future. Thank u lux for the awesome experience.
We have been remodeling our "forever" home and I have made several comments/reviews on a few co. that we have use since moving into the valley in june 2014.. One more to add to my excellent reviews- Budget Blinds of East Mesa.   The owner, Steve, and his wife have been very easy to work with.  Steve came to my home, measured, ordered and came back to install and everything was perfect.  In fact I have ordered a few more and when I decide to do the front of our home, I will definitely use Budget Blinds again.. They do what they say and deliver on time and on budget.
This place is interesting, though some of the baked items are gross (ie 'paleo'...did cavemen have chocolate chip cookies?). Staff can sometimes be unpleasant.
Truly fantastic coffee, great food, and terrific vibe.
Just had Doug with Affordable Pet doors install a Hale Security Pet door in my new home!  He was on time and did a fabulous job.  Very friendly, efficient, and did not leave a spec of dirt behind!  Highly recommend!!
THE MAC AND CHEESE.. Add the bacon and jalapeno tho. Oh and the chai is  especially with any baked good, but really ANY cause it's all that good. Oh and it's just super cute inside.
This place is magical. Super spacious, chill vibe and delicious food. I had the pear and raspberry pie warmed up and the bacon and jalapeno mac&cheese, it was EPIC.!
Love this place! . . Local, diverse, hip, and most importantly it has the best deserts and Mac and cheese! . . Did I mention that they also have a full bar? Lovely!!! Their mixologist is are awesome! . . I highly recommend it!
Awesome service, good vibe and I love the distance from the light rail.
one word....amazing!
Massage Envy-Queen Creek. . Great massages by Tee.  You will come out feeling great.  Enviroment is relaxing at this location.
Great place!
Nice place that has a hipster vibe without being pretentious. Good coffee and pastries.
Loved this place! Such a great environment to get some work done!
There's really nothing else in the area that's comparable, meaning, You don't have any other choice, and I wish you did.. . Lux is too small, too crowded, too loud, and the coffee is mediocre.. . The food is fantastic though.. . So, three stars just because it's there.
Great place to get some work done, or go meet up with friends. I love the food they serve, and I highly recommend their brownies. On the down side, it tends to get a little bit too crowded. Definitely a place to check out!
Aunt Gladys, you cut to the core of me! Lux is always my go-to when I want the perfect breakfast. Make sure to try the Aunt Gladys omelette along side a flat white coffee (:
Hidden treasure on Central Ave.  Authentic, local, Phoenix culture.  Coffee and pastries are fairly priced and very good.  Cocktails in the evening are unique but a little pricey.
Great coffee and meeting spot! Love everything about this place.
Lux feels trendier than I'd prefer BUT their Mac-n-Cheese is to die for.  Go get some!  You won't regret it.
Love this place.  Great coffee, fabulous, homemade everything.  Can't beat it.
I love the food, the setting, all of it! Sometimes the staff is a little too lax, but for the most part, it's a great, yummy place to enjoy, have a meeting, or just chill.
This place is my favorite coffee spot in Phoenix. It's also pretty cool you can get alcohol here if you want as well.  Also their Mac and Cheese is to die for ._.
I love the new location. I know, I know, everyone has been talking about it for years. I live in the 'hood, and didn't much like the old location. Walking into a cafe, only to see a sea of laptops, isn't very welcoming. Not their fault, of course.. . The new location offers up some tasty treats. I've had a few of the breakfast and lunch items. . . It can be a bit confusing to find it at first. You have to go in the back door. (Hahahahaha you know what *I* am thinking, right?) Picking up your order is tricky, because it gets loud in there and you may not hear your name called.. . I prefer the back (front) room. Less traffic, and there's a cool bar to sit at.
Great locals spot, great food, great variety, great coffee, great vibe! Too loud & crowded to relax & read a book but a very cool & consistent place to grab food with friends.
I'd visit Lux every day if I lived closer, but I'm a little too far east to do so.  Nonetheless, this IS my favorite coffee house in the Phoenix Valley, and I could say that its one of my favorite locations to get a drink after work... and I could also say that their baked goods and dishes are so yummy that its one of my favorite little restaurants as well.  Its eclecticness is much of its charm, but everything is also so very well done.. . Upon my first visit there -- as part of an eclectic, hardworking group of maybe 10 activists, academics, and lawyers at the end of a very long day -- our group stumbled in to Lux, which was a little disorienting having never been there and not knowing what to expect (its a very unique but comfortable environment).  Almost immediately, we were welcomed in by someone (an owner?) who found us some seats, made us some drinks, talked with us for a bit... showed me around, explained the menu to me and, despite the crazy frenetic buzz of that evening, in very short time we all felt really comfortable, a part things (for lack of a better description), and had a really nice, memorable evening.. . In the mornings, coffee & espresso drinks are simply wonderful... the various freshly baked things are just wow-good.. . I love Lux (see you in the morning!).
Terrific, fun place that gets better all the time!
This place has fresh scones, living room/community-style setting, and people on laptops doing their homework, or people chatting enjoying a good cup of coffee. The roast on the coffee was perfect, no wimpy coffee here. . . The place can be a little intimidating when busy (which is mostly), between people passing wine and coffee at the community tables, to peoplelounging on the sofas. There seems to be a sense of community when you walk in. The employees were extremely friendly but when they get packed (think mornings), parking can be a little difficult to procure. However, there is plenty of street parking! The owner posts their fresh dinner menu daily on fb.
Cool vibe. Urban feel. Delicious drinks. Coffee is always on point. Just a tip to Americano drinkers, they charger their Americanos the same price for whatever size so get the large! . . One of my favorite study spots.. . Had their jalapeno and bacon mac and cheese the other night. It was served in a massive mug, and it was delicious!
