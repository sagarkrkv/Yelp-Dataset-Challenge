I went into Holsteins with high expectations, and unfortunately was let down. The service was quite slow for 6 people and the food was underwhelming.  We each ordered burgers, but I didn't think anything was special about it.  I also had onion rings.   I was a bit annoyed when I asked if I could have half onion rings, and half fries.  The waiter replied "We won't customize anything here.  Even if you wanted your burger cut in half, we would just give you a knife.". . That for me makes me give Holsteins 3 stars.  I had the grass hopper milk shake as well (with an extra shot).  The problem with service being so slow, was that by the time the food came, I had pretty much finished the milk shake and was quite full.. . Overall, Holsteins is not very memorable, and I would rather go to BURGR or Burgar Bar.  There clearly was a reason why Hosteins had no wait, and the other burger places did.
Great vegan options and they offer gluten free buns. The vegan shake is also amazing. Thank god Vegas is finally catching on with healthy options.. . Comfortable lounge seating is nice.
I wanted to like this place so bad. They have a unique decor inside and fun booths with a number of tvs to watch the games. Unfortunately, I've just had much better burgers. There is nothing wrong with the burgers; they are fine. But they don't taste quite as good as they look (or sound). For $14-16 range the burgers should be excellent, and these just aren't quite there.
Great burger as always, I came here when they first opened and I was happy to see that it had gotten even better a few years later. Ashley did a great job, however the other server working the lounge around 130 on 11-1 was not so friendly, again Ashley was fantastic not just with us but with all the customers she interacted with. Gold standards and rising sun were great as were the rings, rotating taps a big plus (love big sky brewing). One of the best burgers you will find anywhere.
Three stars for amazing service. Bar tenders and waiters were amazing. They advertise a vegan burger, but our server double checked and it turns out the buns are not vegan ... and he let us know. Will we return for beer selection? Maybe. Will we return for food? No.
Adult milkshake!! yum....the pumpkin pie shake tastes just like a pumpkin pie...I guess they use real pumpkin pie puree inside!. . Got the salmon burger, it was good but a little too salty for my tastes. . $17 salmon burger wasn't too bad since it was a pretty big piece of salmon with more salmon lox on top with fries....the $13 shake seems like it subsidizes the lower fish cost...good to try once, wouldn't come back. . happy Vegas-ing!
I'm not sure why we came here with so many "good" restaurants nearby.. . Server with an huge attitude. Food is ok.
Well.... it was good. ... but not great.  While there were lots of interesting choices,  the burger itself was just average. burgers are around 18 to 20 bucks each.  Not cheap.  Service was not great.  It was just average.
This place is so GOOD! I have been here twice and was satisfied with both experiences. I have tried the Rising Sun and Nom Nom burger. I'd recommend trying the Rising Sun because who can resist kobe beef, crispy yam, and avocado tempura all in one burger amongst some other stuff??? The crunchy texture just adds a whole new dimension to the burger. I eat a good amount of food and the burgers here are pretty filling. You also HAVE to try one of their milkshakes, whether it be a plain non-alcoholic one or the cool looking adult ones with alcohol haha. I have only tried the strawberry milkshake and it was so good and creamy without feeling too excessive. I usually don't like getting milkshakes, but this is one of the FEW places I am willing to get them. I will definitely go here the next time I am craving a burger on the strip and will probably try another milkshake. Check this place out!
This review is probably a bit outdated, since the first and last time I had Holsteins was in June 2012. We decided to drop by here for a quick lunch before Marquee Dayclub, since it's right outside Marquee's main entrance on the 2nd level. For some reason or another, we decided to sit in the bar and lounge area, instead of the dining area. The lounge had a few couches and chairs and we found a spot that fit seven of us. The rest of our group decided to sit at the bar.. . Not all of us ate, and I honestly don't even remember if I had a burger or not. If I did, it was obviously pretty unmemorable. I do remember getting fries and those were pretty standard. I also remember the service being on the poor side, but it wasn't a big deal. At that time, if you checked in on Foursquare, you could get a free pint of beer. Our server said all 10 of us had to check in and show him the check-in for us to get it. Not all of us had Foursquare or cell service, so that was kind of irritating and inefficient. I mean, technically he didn't do anything wrong, but you know there are always those servers who are more lax and will get you the freebie without actually seeing the check-in. This guy was not one of those servers.. . Every time I pass by Holsteins since then, I get bad vibes so I doubt I'd ever come back, unless it's for convenience. If I'm going to Dayclub, I'd rather get bottle service and food from Marquee, which is surprisingly tasty, than eat at Holsteins again.
This place seems awesome so far. Good atmosphere, good shakes. It's 2:00 pm on a Saturday and it's been almost an hour since we ordered our food. Still waiting. Hopefully it's good. Food review to follow.
Wow... this establishment turned out to be a home run!. . We were in Las Vegas attending a tradeshow and ventured out to Holsteins on a recommendation of a friend. Holstein is located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan. Just go up the escalator near the entrance of casino/hotel adjacent to Las Vegas Blvd. and you'll see it.. . First off, don't let the prices discourage you. It is very much worth it. It can be a little out of the way, but the trip is definitely worth it as well. For a burger entree, expect to pay $16-20 depending on which burger  you get.. . We came in for lunch around 2PM on a Friday. There wasn't any wait and we were seated immediately. The waitress was extremely nice and accommodating. I did catch her name, but my receipt says her name is Tiffany.. . There's a lot of good burger options and it was kind of difficult to find the one that I wanted to try. I ended up with the Nom Nom burger. The burger was really good. More like amazing! The french fries that came with the meal wasn't bad either. There wasn't anything really special about the french fries.. . My two colleagues both ordered Classic burgers. I think they were a little more old school and wanted something less fancy smancy. Totally a preference thing. Both of them are usually pretty talkative, but once the food came out and they bit into their burgers, the table pretty much became silent. That's usually a sign that the food was really good. They thoroughly enjoyed their burgers and definitely agreed that it was worth the money.. . I rate Holsteins 5 stars out of 5. Great food. Great service. Burgers are amazing. Service is quick. There's not a whole lot to complain about. It was definitely a solid experience. If there was something to complain about, it would be the price, BUT given that it was Las Vegas it was ball park. We have had more expensive food that was drastically less tasty.. . Tips: If you aren't near the Cosmo, Holsteins might be a little out of the way, definitely make an effort to go.. . Holstein charges $3.95 for Iced Tea. Might be the case with other establishments in the area as well.. . Prepare to be very lost with burger options... so many good signature burgers... maybe review the menu before hand?? I was torn between 3 or 4 burgers but ended up choosing the Nom Nom (Kobe beef, potato chips, Island dressing). No idea why... :P. . Don't be afraid to ask for directions... I think all the casinos are designed to be death traps and mazes.
Best restaurant in vegas hands down, fresh burgers, amazing location!!!! A must try, thanks Holsteins!!!!!
Holy milkshake! I think all the boys come to the yard for these milkshakes (bad joke)! We visited here on our last night in Vegas with a rather large party, which they accommodated quickly. All me & my husband had were milkshakes. I had a basic caramel shake, while my husband had a shake with chocolate covered bacon & a little alcohol--both were amazing. One drawback is that we spent $22 on two shakes...but when in Vegas....
As suggested by the name, shakes and burgers are the specialty. There are fun and interesting array of shakes to choose from. We tried the Fat Boy shake that has a combination of cookies n' cream, sprinkles, butterfinger. It was good! We ordered the Truffle Lobster Mac N' Cheese to start out...it was good but not the best we've had. The burger was very good; we ordered the Sun Burger. It has a good combo of sauce to onions and a juicy Kobe beef. Our medium request came out more like medium well, but still surprisingly very juicy nonetheless. Overall, it is a great lunch spot with fun cow decor and designs. Good with a group and fairly family friendly.
Service was fine - I sat at the bar.. Partially this might be my mistake - i came here for late lunch.  I wasn't sure if I was into having an 8oz burger (ie the big bun) so I decided to go for the tiny buns (3 sliders per serve).. . 2nd mistake - I ordered something other than a beef patty (pretty obvious this is a beef place).  I ordered the Ahi sliders.. . So yes maybe other choices would have been better.  But for a place with burgers as main attraction as a burger?  The slider buns were very disappointing - cold and hard.  The Ahi had a spicy herb crust on the outside and tasted decent (nothing to rave about), the cucumber and slaw under the quartered piece of Ahi were actually in my opinion the highlight.  In fact I would have paid for that to be an Ahi cucumber salad much more happily.. . Sweet potato fries I added were decent - but again not really memorable.. . The redeeming thing?  The margarita I ordered was very nice.
Came here last month while I was in Las Vegas and I'm a definite fan! Probably one of the best burgers I've had in a while. It was one of those kind of messy but sooo tasty burgers that you just can't NOT eat in one sitting. . . We came in early for lunch on a Sunday before leaving Vegas and it was basically empty. We were sat immediately and within minutes I had eyed one of their seasonal milkshakes (with some booze of course!) a Pumpkin Pie milkshake. Literally SO Good. It had pumpkin pie vodka in it with with pumpkin pie filling, pepitas, and graham cracker crumble. I was literally drinking a pumpkin pie spiked with vodka and it was heaven! Ordered the the "Fun Ghi" burger to eat because I'm a big fan of mushrooms and truffle mayo and it was delicious! The meat was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the gruyere cheese complimented the burger really well. The fries it came with were seasoned and crispy as well! . . There are a ton of burger joints in Vegas and they are all over priced but I'd rate Holsteins up there as one of the best. I love the cute decor and the trendy atmosphere with its location right in the heart of the Cosmopolitan.
Hands down the best burger and shake I ever had. It was worth the money alil bit expensive but your in vegas what else do u expect.  The thai salad was so amazing the best steak salad I had it was cooked and season really well. It's a plus the restaurant was next to Marquee the hottest night club in vegas now. I will definitely be back to try more burgers
While the burgers and other menu items are good, the shakes with alcohol are the unique touch for here. Last time I ate there I tried the Cuban "street" taco and was a little disappointed: the taco was so thin and crispy that it shattered with each bite and left me with a handful of filling;about that, the mixture of shredded pork and ham ( although it wasn't really mixed, the ham was a slice under the pork) was under seasoned and dry. Good flavor otherwise. In past visits I was much more satisfied,so I still consider this a very good spot ( especially those spiked shakes !! )
Stopped by after a year away. They have updated the menu some, and the new bam-boozled shakes Rock! "The Fat Boy" may very well be my fav shake of all time. Worth a stop just for the shakes; the Fat Boy shake alone is worth another star....
SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS!  For a shake, slider, burger and fries. Admittedly this is Vegas....but $64.00...really!  The alcohol infused shakes are the draw.  We split a donut shake, infused with Kahlua, and it was good....though a little on the weak alcohol content.  The shake brought back childhood memories of the old shake shops where you get not only a large glass shake, but half a metal shake container full of extra as well! More than enough to share.  I ordered the steakhouse burger that came with fries.  It was topped with mushrooms and Swiss cheese.  The burger itself was kind of devoid of taste...but did have a spicy kick of peppercorns.  My wife ordered the sliders and topped it with blue cheese, caramelized onions....and those three little burgers were the prize.  Very tasty.  Service was good, seating was fine...but overall, (and especially for the price)...Meh!
They have the most delicious vegan burger I've ever had in my life. And their vegan shake is amazing! The first time I came here, I brought a non-vegetarian who was absolutely floored by how delicious the vegan burger was, and actually said it was the best burger he'd ever had. The Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake is just awesome- it's topped with vegan marshmallow and fluffy vegan whipped cream that is divine.. The second time I came here, which was recent, I brought a friend who's a huge skeptic of all things vegan, and even he admitted that the shake was actually wonderful, and better than the other (non-vegan) shakes he's had there in the past. However, they actually ran out of all their vegan burgers at that time, so we couldn't eat there. I suggest calling ahead to make sure they've got it in stock!
Best burgers in Vegas.. The Gold Standard is classic!!! The shakes are my new favorite part of the restaurant though. The coffee and cake shake is to die for and the fact that they mix bacon with chocolate simply blows your mind.
Over thousand reviews later WHAT could I add?? Well I will give it a go!! In the world of gourmet burgers whether on the strip or venture outside no shortage of quality spots get your burger on...Most part hit all of them exception of Umami or Guy Fieri. The thing that stood out the most for me is the atmosphere at Holsteins Shakes and Buns. It just screams good vibes, family atmosphere (between pasture and pastures of cows everywhere you look) cartoon characters interior decor, and far cry from all the other restaurants in the Cosmo. The prices are reasonable price or should say same like most of the other "gourmet" burger places $12-15. They do have the over the top foi gras burgers that not reasonable price. . . I came to Holsteins for recovery Volunteer meal after working the RnR Marathon with family. After seeing over 40,000 runners working hard that makes anyone hungry. Thankfully we had reservations cause anything on the strip on RnR day is madhouse. Just made even more impression that the service we had was awesome. The restaurant literally had no empty tables. Yet out waiter was very much on it! He did great job explaining the menu for couple first timers like me. Very attentive once we got our food making sure our glass never empty and checking see if everything was good. We even split the bill with different credit cards but never complain and still had smile at the end of the night.. . I ordered the Steakhouse Burger. It was really good. I was leaning towards some of the main stay popular choices. The more keep looking at the Steakhouse Burger not get off it. Their steak house sauce combine with tomato confit, cheese, and more just working out in my head delicious. I got my burger first impression was looks like DAM good burger. Sorry about no picture. I was starving going full volunteer shift my choice no break. It was the perfect recovery meal. The size is nice. It not tiny nor over the top huge burger. All the burgers comes with choice of side. Free side that worth star by itself considering most of the other gourmet burgers spots just paying for the burger. The burger was cooked perfect medium just liked I ordered. The flavors was the perfect combination. Think of it as pepper crusted steak with creamy A1 sauce. Ok. It might not be doing it justice but just giving you idea. . . If not in the mood for burgers they got you covered from Salmon Burger (looking good also), veggie burger, or turkey burger. The shakes got to see the birthday cake (think that was it). I passed on the shakes. Talk about list! Am sure if shake fan they got you covered. . . Just for the 808. The cows reminded me of meadow gold taking the tour in 808. Cartoon character cows forget the name of two??
This place is great the lobster truffle Mac and cheese is the business and the shakes mmm.  I like the Nom nom burger with a fried egg and sweet potato fries
Fun place with great food!  We decided to come here before hitting up the club.  The DJ was playing hot music and everyone was vibing and having a great time!  Me and my crew ate some yummy apps and had some good drinks.  I loved the philly egg rolls and the steak quesadillas with kimchi.  Our sever Britney was really cool.  She got us our food and drinks quickly and she had a great personality.  Some badly dressed, married dude wandered up to me and my girls and bought us a round of Patrone shots!  Nice!!  This spot was ideal for people watching as it was right next to the line for Marquee nightclub.  The line was packed and watching wasted, scantily clad people is very entertaining.
This burger and shake place is so good! We've been here a few times now. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star is because the burger I got this time wasn't as good. The atmosphere, and staff are awesome and staff is always on point with everything. Their shakes are mind blowing so make sure you try one of their shakes or you will be missing out!
Great service, food, and atmosphere. I got their specialty burger and it was to die for. The sweet potato fries were also very good, and the price was reasonable. I wish there was one closer to us back home.
WOW, one of my Favorite spots we tried during our weekend visit.  Great Burgers and Awesome Milkshakes, what more do you need?  How about Buffalo Chicken Dip (AMAZING) or Bulgogi Quesidillas (YUM).  I tried the El Caliente*  Burger - . Beef Patty Topped w/ Pepper Jack Cheese, Pickled Jalapeno, Avocado, Pork Chicharrones & Tequila-Cilantro Mayo.  Yes Chicharrones, Never thought about mixing the 2 but man this was a memorable experience.  Very Cool concept and will return next time in Vegas.
I thought this place was just ok. It could have been what I ordered. I would give it another go.
