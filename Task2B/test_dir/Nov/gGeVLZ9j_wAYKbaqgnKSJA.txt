They need to change their servers. The ambience is good, food is good but the server was almost humilating and insensitive towards the guest preferences. I think they know that people will come anyway so they don't care about the customer service or involving with the guest to understand their needs. But what they fail to realize is that on an average you are paying approx. $60 per guest if not more and that for sure calls for a good customer service.. They also force you to pay a minimum 20% tip by asking you to presign your check instead of letting you decide what tip you want to give based on the service. . Overall, this is not a place where I would take a delegate to. . Food selection is also redesigned but food was ok, as you would expect in an Asian bistro.
Amazing food. This is an upscale restaurant but with prices that are perfectly reasonable. There was a great selection of upscale Asian dishes.. . I loved the ambience, but it was extremely loud. Like much louder than I am accustomed to even when it comes to vibrant "trendy" restaurants. But overall I definitely plan to go here again.
Service and food is always extraordinary at Tao! I make it a point to eat here every time I visit LV. The Chilean SeaBass appy is to die for! I have never been disappointed -- worth the money!
I have no idea what people are seeing in this restaurant.  This place is like a mediocre P.F. Chang's you wait twice as long and pay twice as much for.  There are too many amazing restaurants in Vegas to waste your time here. Turn around and head out, do not pass Go and save your $200.  Seriously, if you have any sort of culinary expectations look for another option.  If you're looking for naked girls in bathtubs, this may be your place (although, no girls in the bathtubs the night we came). . . A group of co-workers were all here for a conference and decided to try this place out since we were staying at the Venetian.  We made a reservation for 8:30 and when we arrived were told we would be seated 'in a few moments' 40 minutes later (and a few times getting the run around by the guy in charge of seating), we finally got to a table.   . . Tao highlights the modern Asian fusion movement on their menu.  Unfortunately they also have tried to mask their lack of flavor in dishes by making them overly salty or overly sweet.  This makes everything taste like it's a microwave dinner or some sort of bad Chinese takeout.  . . We tried the Thai Crabcakes (WAY too much sauce that was overly sweet with very little spice element, kinda tasted like one you can buy out of a bottle), Hot and Sour Soup (decent, but the shrimp toast was the highlight), Crispy Pork Bao Buns (The pork was again WAY too sweet and the bun had too much dough to pork ratio, this was barely edible),  Crispy Orange chicken (another overly sweet dish that was deemed not even as good as Chinese takeout), Kobe Ribeye (NO way this is real Kobe, despite assurances from our server. It was tough and hard to cut, we had real Kobe at Gordon Ramsey's the next night and there was no comparison) and a few sushi/sashimi rolls (decent, but the rice wasn't well flavored. We had better sushi at the buffet). . . Our waiter was very nice and attentive, but there were certain elements of dishes that were left off (rice for the Orange Chicken, asked for sauce on the side for a couple dishes that wasn't done).  All in all a truly regrettable experience from start to finish. Their fortunes for their cookies were pretty funny though.
Tao Asian Bistro is a trendy, OVERPRICED version of PF Chang's located in the Venetian Hotel. At first glance, Tao's eastern Buddhist inspired atmosphere was inviting, warm, and unique despite the men in black that guarded the entrance. Even on a Tuesday night, the dining room was almost full with late 20s- 30s casual business class patrons. Our host and waiter were efficient though and we were seated right away. So, 4 stars for the ambience and courteous staff!!. . Food: We ordered a spicy tuna avocado roll and Singaporean noodle paired with tap water, of course. The spicy tuna avocado roll was good, but nothing spectacular for its $17 price tag. The Singaporean noodle ($26! oh shit! ka-ching!) was dry, cold, and boasted of flavors from the far-east...just kidding, more like flavors from the Costco frozen aisle. Since it was my bff's birthday, they gave us a delicious complimentary dessert, which was the best part of the meal...and i would come back here just for that. The dessert was creatively presented as a giant fortune cookie, decked with a lining of chocolate almonds atop a bed of vanilla and chocolate mouse and surrounded by fresh fruits. The "fortune cookie" is really a crunchy crepe, which was not too sweet and just the right price (free!). . . We were definitely disappointed with this meal overall, but still had an awesome time because the crowd and waiters were fun! If you want to dress up, but not to the fancy extent of Picasso or Joel Robunchon (umm...completely different price range lol), you might want to check this place out. We might try this place again, but next time opt for their entrees instead.
The Tao Asian Bistro at the Venetian is basically an very upscale P.F. Changs when it comes to the quality of food here. In general the benefit of eating here is that it gets you quick and free access to the Tao night club at the Venetian. With a drink or two a piece dinner will run you about $70 per head. Again not bad for the Las Vegas strip and the fact you get into the club. Otherwise the food is ok.
I went here for my birthday dinner this last Saturday and it was such a great experience.. . The staff was so friendly and everyone was attentive and the food was great! I also loved the fun and lively atmosphere since Tao is my favorite nightclub in Vega I was excited to finally have a dinner there and it was great.. . The server even surprised me with a huge birthday dessert of a fortune cookie and it was so yummy!. . Definitely would go back again!
I don't get it. We had a reservation for 9:45pm and after inquiring several times, finally got seated at 10:30 pm. So, I thought, this must be amazing food! The food here was no better than your average Pei Wei/PF Changs. $13/a small bowl (less than 2 cups) of vegetable rice is outrageous. We ordered scallops, Sea Bass $39, Orange chicken $28, and coconut shrimp for 4 of us. My husband and I had green tea and the other couple had one drink each. The Sea Bass and the shrimp were the better of the four dishes, in my opinion. The scallops were large, there were 4. They were soaked in a curry sauce, which I did not care for. The service was just o k, although the server said one dish of rice would be plenty, but after each one of us had 2-3 tablespoons, another dish was ordered (another $13)f The bill was probably $230 including tip.. . The worst of all was the noise level. There were bunches of girls in short dresses with 6 inch heels scampering upstairs to the nightclub at $60 a head. The noise, oh the noise! We had to sit in silence while eating because the music level and the bass was so incredibly deafening, we could not hear anything but bass.  By the time we were done with dinner, I had a horrible headache. . . If you don't need to worry about how much you spend, and you like very trendy, loud restaurants with mediocre food and naked girls in bathtubs, then this place is for you!
Came here for my birthday dinner and it wasn't as special as I thought it was gonna be, just another overpriced restaurant with mediocre food, it just wasn't worth it, the duck fried rice was decent at best the sushi below average and the ambience was cool and that's about it, nothing spectacular.
Place is a bit loud. The menu is too confusing and the service left much to be desired.
Tao is the best place in Vegas ! The flavors are unmatched ! Every single dish we ordered from the hamachi with truffle sauce to the biggest fortune cookie and banana pudding was amazing. Hands down the best place to eat in Vegas
This place, to me was 1/2 a step up from PF Chang's. Our food came out cold; they packed as many people as they could fit in the restaurant; it was loud and very pretentious. I won't be going back.. . Great beer choices though; Lucky Buddha was crisp and light.
Really great decor and indicative of a great Vegas dining experience!! This was my 6th time here, but I never left a review before. Things I've tried here are: Sushi rolls (Great), Flamingo Roll (Good), Sea Bass (Great) Wasabi encrusted Filet (Good), Tuna Tartar on crispy rice (Amazing). It's the desserts that were killer; Mochi Ice Cream (Great) and a bread Pudding that had a Carmel sauce that was off the hook - WOW! (we joked that it must have cocaine in it it was so great!). The key is to get a reservation and come early for dinner.
Excellent service and obviously, the food was spectacular. Our waiter answered all questions and was extremely knowledgable of almost every menu item.
I booked an 8:30pm reservation several months ago when I planned my trip to Vegas. We were not seated until almost 10:00pm. The ambience and decor of the restaurant is spectacular. The Chilean sea bass was probably the best fish I have ever had. I would have given 5 stars but over an hour wait with a reservation is ridiculous.
`Amazing food and service. . Their dumplings, sushi were yum. Cocktails are super good but expensive. . . The highlight was the dessert. The fortune cookie with dark and white chocolate mousse was the best . Next time, would probably start with the dessert course :). . Also, before entering , just pay attention to the happy hour offers.These are typically posted outside the place, at the forum shops. You will have to text to a particular number to get coupons:- buy one get one cocktail free...
Sushi was card board thickness and at $5+ per piece I think that was kinda expensive for what I received.   The place was hopping so I assume we are all idiots for spending so much $ on so little food.  I will admit even though the serving size was small the food was good.  Not good enough for the bill in my humble opinion.. . $47 check, paid with $100 bill and my change is 2*$20 one $10 and two singles.  Tempted to leave the $2 as the tip but I am not that much of an asshole.  Lost another star for poor customer service.
The atmosphere and service were decent but the food was average and overpriced. We got a few different rolls that were so so at best. Would not go back
I've heard so much about Tao in the past and didn't take the time to visit during my last trip to Vegas... This time around, we made it a point to check it out. We were a group of 8 and made a reservation on the same day. I was very surprised they were able to accommodate us with a same day reservation.. . We arrived on time and they escorted us to a sitting area while they finished getting our table ready. Only took about 10 minutes and while we waited we were quickly approached for a drink order. The drinks came out right away while we all enjoyed taking in the very lavish decor.. . I think we were very fortunate with our service, our waiter, TJ, was EXCELLENT! We ordered everything family style and aside from the dishes we asked for, TJ made some great suggestions.. . Everything came out cooked to perfection. I still had a lot of food restrictions to follow and TJ was very attentive to making sure I didn't feel left out and explained which dishes I would be able to eat. Overall, incredible experience! Will definitely return on our next trip to Vegas.
