I thought I'd try this place again, but I can't give this place more than 2 1/2 stars. There is nothing special about the food here other than the huge portions. My food this time was cold and quality wasn't there. . I like the service here, but when I go out to eat ,I go for the food, the service just adds to the whole experience of going out to eat.
They treated us amazing, although I wanted a drink and didn't have my ID with me only my DMV paper they were still trying to figure out how I could get my drink they were very sweet and made sure we were well taken care of!!
Yo I came in this bitch with the whole squad and we aint been serviced in like a couple of hours. Me and the homies set up a dam camp in the lobby cuz we was afraid we wouldn't find shelter before sundown.
Hash a go go is making me slow slow.... . Give me some vanilla waffle and one of twenty coffee syrup flavors to choose and I may be able to get a little boost from that espresso. . But wait, I ate too much of that delicious hash a go go...UH OH! . . I've heard and read amazing things;. I woke up this morning with a stomach ready to be filled up.... What I didn't know was I was going to have breakfast, lunch and dinner all in one sup!. . I devoured my plate, maple syrup and all.. The problem now, is all I want to do is get home to my bed, fast asleep I will fall. . . My friends birthday celebration was what got us to go, . No sing along birthday song, but that's okay, we were too far in a coma, to mention that they were wrong. . . Luckily the scene was interesting,. The waitress was great and the place was really clean. . . There was no wait, parking was a breeze, . We got into our table, in the booth, with nothing but ease.. . Not sure if it would be the same on a Sunday morning or full moon, . More than likely getting a table would mean sitting in a state of doom.  . . Happy I got a little hash a go go, . Even though I'm kinda a little slow slow.... I'm sure once I get some rest,. my words will have more flow flow...
Crap food and just for looks ..  they serve angel hair fried pasta on your plate I thought it was twigs from outside ... I ordered a hamburger and the waitress is supposed to say what would you like on it and that's it but .. She wanted to have a cry face and asked me you want cheese want this you want that and a big attitude like a dick in her ass. The hamburger had no flavor all the food had no flavor they don't know what salt black pepper and garlic powder is ? cuz they want to save f****** money the chicken fried Benedict that was on TV man vs food and it was so small it was enough to feed a little baby here's some advice if you guys serve bad tasting food at least learn your waitresses how to act nice and maybe people will have a good time  learn your waitress  not to order food for people just ask what the customer wants and shut your f****** mouth don't waste your money  they serve big  bread make the food look big but they don't put meat in the corn beef they don't put big meets
Excellent service, monster portions and tasty. I had the Chicken Benedict. Way too much for one person. I kind of deconstructed it as i ate. Cut everything in half before you start eating and drop in a take-a-way when you leave. you will have at a couple meals the next day. I like this location better than the strip (quad) location. a little more open inside.
Jessica was our server - AMAZING service,attentive, quick, friendly and witty.. . Food- AWESOME!. . You can't go wrong coming here.
I went with three friends to Hash House a Go Go on Sunday.  First we were told that the wait for 4 was no more than 20 minutes.  1 hour later I had to check on our reservation and was told three more people ahead of us.  FINALLY we were seated and ordered.  This is where the disaster started to get worse.  . . My friend ordered the Waffles and Chicken and a pumpkin pancake and the rest of us ordered the Tractor.  The waffles and chicken arrive with a LONG BLACK HAIR in the food.  We sent it back and by this time lost our appetites.  One person who told us was the manager came over and apologized and did not offer to do anything.  We proceed through our meal and I have to say the pancakes were heavy dough and no taste.  When the bill arrived guess what the waffles and chicken and pumpkin pancake still on the bill.  We call over the "so called Manager" who told us she would have to get the Manager.  Lailani came over and said they just forgot to take it off the bill and would fix it.  Then we see the pumpkin pancake is still on there.  We asked why we were not compensated for that since it was part of the meal with the hair in it.  She said they do not give any compensation for food sent back and had a very arrogant attitude. She said corporate does not allow them to even offer a complimentary dessert or drink for any errors.  I don't think a HAIR in the food any just an "error."  . .  We said that the staff did not have their hair covered in the kitchen and she was arguing with us and we had full view of the cooks behind the counter.  We then asked how we could reach the corporate office and who was the owner and "she didn't know"  she was argumentative, rude and condescending.  I am in the food and beverage industry and if I treated my customers with the disrespect that Lailani did I am sure I would not have a job.  . . Two of the three people with me were from out of town and we wanted to have a nice relaxing brunch which turned into a nightmare of an experience.  On the way out we asked who owned the restaurant and how to reach them and the hostess seemed to have full knowledge on how we could reach the person to file a complaint.  A complaint was filed on Monday with corporate but to date nothing received.  This restaurant needs to train their managers in customer server and respect for the customer.  LAILANI is the worst manager I have ever met.  Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant.
Terrible service, the waiter forgot all of our side plates and all he said was "I had a lot of shit going on".  Their French toast were also soggy.  They did bring one side (bacon) which they just tossed at our table and the bacon fell off the dish.
There is nothing special about Hash House. Seriously, spend your money somewhere else. I cannot believe HH has so many positive reviews.. . Their portions are large, but their flavor is absent. For just okay food, you will pay more than you should. . . I ordered the sage chicken and waffles. The waffle is cooked around slices of bacon, but it's a gross bacon- reminded me of turkey bacon, which isn't bacon at all. There's nothing creative or mind-blowing about this version of chicken and waffles and if I ever get dragged back to HH, I will not be ordering it again.  I'm comparing this (and every other chicken and waffle dish that I try) to Gussie's in San Francisco, where the chicken was juicy and flavorful and they put a creative spin on syrup.
This restaurant came highly rated from friend's of my wife, but sadly, it did not deliver.  Huge portions, but IMO, not huge on flavour.  I ordered the BBQ ribs which which came out on a big, giant plate with mashed potatoes covering most of the plate and some green beans & carrots as garnish.  The ribs were placed on top of the potatoes, but the ribs barely had any BBQ sauce on them.  Even worse, the ribs were hard to cut, chewy, and were flavourless.  I only ate one rib and that was enough.  Didn't even want to take the leftovers home.  . . My wife ordered the signature fried chicken & waffles, and since the portions were so big, I helped her eat her meal, or I would have gone hungry for the rest of the night.  Our kids ordered the meatloaf which was pretty tasty.  A decent offering of kids menu choices.. . Service was good, drinks refilled without even asking.  . . Bottom line, if you just want a lot of food and don't care about flavours, it's your place to be.
OMG!!! One of the best breakfast spots Ever!!! Our server Jess was Amazing...and service was great! Unfortunately I have no photo to show because the food was sooo good it was gone within a few mins!
Best place ever for foodies. If your are in Vegas this is a must go. I saw it on the food channel and bookmarked it in my yelp. I happened to join my hubby on a work trip and told him that we needed to eat here and we had to get The chicken and Waffles. . . We go up the escalator and walknin. It was crowded but the wait wasn't long. It gave us enough time to look at the menu and see what we wanted to devour. . . I went with the signature chicken and Waffles and my boo the steak eggs Benedict. The presentation of the food is a work of art. The flavors were bursting in my mouth. The just of right crispness of the waffle and juicy bonesses chickenbreast with rosemary seasoning. Ugh I want one now please!. . The steak and eggs Benedict was also yummy. Not everyone makes a great hollandaise sauce but they nailed it. . . Check out foodiecutie for my pics of what I ate.
I live this place. The food is great and the mimosas are great. The service was phenomenal. Out waitress was overly busy so the other wait staff stepped up and helped take care of us. It was great and I suggest anyone try this restaurant, but you better be hungry. The portions are huge.
For all of the hype promoting this chain, this location utterly FAILS. Our host sat us in a booth, and before I slid to the center of the seat, I noticed what appeared be cola splattered all over the seat. Like a cow pissing on a flat rock. Wow. We got another seat but waited 8 mins to be noticed. The food was OK. Not spectacular, memorable or worth returning for. The ladies bathroom was a mess, with over-filled garbage cans, a soap dispenser didn't work and one of the towel machines didn't work. I hope their staff washes their hands somewhere else.. . I won't be back.
I decided to try Hash House after all the great reviews on Yelp.  I just don't get it.  Large portions does not equate to good food.  I suspect Hash house is great after a night of drinking and I assume you're still drunk in the A.M.  to be happy to pay big bucks for marginal food.  I do NOT recommend Hash house....but if you MUST try it, brace yourself for  Major Disappointment.  Food's OK, but does not live up to the Hype.
Always a line to get in, but what do you expect for a good place? Been coming here for years. Portions are extremely generous. Hell, I could get away w/ ordering one entree if I took a date here. My go-to's are the chicken n waffle tower and any of the Benedict's. Always flavorful. Go here! Trust the fat kid
A lot of food!!!. The portion sizes are huge!. My husband and I got the chicken and waffles, thank goodness we saw someone else's order when we came in and saw that  it was definitely enough for the two of us to share. 4 large waffles with 2 extra large pieces of chicken on top.. Service was amazing. Refilled my coffee quickly, brought extra syrup.... attentive without hovering over you!
I don't get the allure of this place at all. I'm personally not a fan of high quantity accomplished through sacrificing quality. We came here because my husband wanted something unhealthy and fried, but we should have used up those calories somewhere else. I had the chicken and waffles, and although the plate looked like a spectacle... being a spectacle is not always a good thing. I would only come back here if I was being dragged to it by tourists who use the moniker "foodie" too freely. Their cocktail mixes are pretty good, but again, more focused on looking good rather than actually tasting good. If I'm going to eat unhealthy, I'd rather go to Raising Canes BJs, Cheesecake Factory... anywhere else really.
VERDICT: Impressive LOOKING food...that is all.. . Greg and I got so excited to see Hash House a Go Go on the Travel Channel or Food Network or whatever channel they got onto.  Finally, a really fun restaurant in Las Vegas that isn't on the strip.. . I've been to Hash House a Go Go several times and I have to say, I'm not a fan.  Here's the deal, the food is impressive looking.  Just do an Google image search for Hash House a Go Go to see some of the creations.  The visual wowness of the food is really the only best part about it.  The biscuits are dry, crumbly and tasteless.  The "homemade" strawberry preserves tastes just like Smuckers.  The breakfast potatoes are bland and often undercooked.  The food that people rave about is basically food that is pretty hard to mess up, like pancakes, waffles and fried chicken.. . Basically, the presentation can be summed up as this:  Stack a bunch of large portions of food on top of each other, throw some fried grass of some kind on top of it or uncooked spaghetti, and shove a large twig of rosemary down the middle to make it look fancy. . I can throw food on my plate with some weeds at home.  Thanks.
I've been to the HH in San Diego for breakfast/brunch a few times. This was the first time we've dined at HH. Very worthwhile. We had a delicious entertaining meal. A nice way to close our Las Vegas trip.
