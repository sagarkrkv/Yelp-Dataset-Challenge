This hotel needs upgrades. No coffee maker in the rooms, terrible wi-fi only allows one hook up have to pay for additional devices. Carpets dirty and staff limited. Very disappointed will not stay at this hotel ever again..such a big hotel you think they would have free wifi
We stayed at Paris for the Marine Corps ball and walked over to Bally ' s forbreakfast. Sidewalk cafe seemed to have a decent menu so we went in. We were greeted by a very pleasant accommodating host/manager Sal. He was fabulous he moved the line quickly and made us feel like we were the only customers! Food was reasonable price wise and surprisingly tasty! And we weren't hating the $5 mimosas and bloodys! Great for the money and Sal and the staff were great! Not your typical grumpy vegas employees :)
While my stay at Ballys was nice, the checkout experience has been a nightmare. I was promised an email receipt of my bill the day I checked out. I didn't receive it. I then went to the website because you can't talk to anyone and requested a copy of my receipt and I still haven't received it, it's been 5 days. How difficult is it to give a client a receipt when you charge the credit card?
Wonderful place to stay for 2 days!! You can also connect to other hotels! Staying here is at a reasonable price too and not expensive at all right on the Las Vegas strip, which is easy access to every place you can think of!
The first thing I noticed when I walked into the lobby was the cigarette smoke smell.  Okay, to be fair, all of the hotels/casinos allow smoking - as annoying as it is.  But I get it.  Gamblers smoke.  However, I walked through most of the casinos on the strip, and none of them had the stench of Bally's.  They all had either some sort of air fresheners to mask the smell, or at the very least better ventilation.  Bally's simply stunk.  And pretty bad.  They definitely need better ventilation in the casino/lobby.  Secondly, the entire time I was playing the games over three days, NOT ONE cocktail waitress offered me a drink.  I was under the impression that as long as you are gambling, drinks are on the house.  In fact, the one or two waitresses I did see were not accepting anything more than tips for the drinks.  I don't know why I was ignored.  My room was very nice, and extremely big.  I did, however, have to put the heat on 80 degrees to get it warm (I happened to visit Vegas on the coldest days of the year).  The hotel/casino was nice, but comparatively speaking, not nearly as nice as the others I saw on the strip, for similar prices.  Next time I go to Vegas I'm staying elsewhere.
Meh.  We stayed here because the price was right.  It wasn't good, but it definitely wasn't bad.  I would stay here again if needed.  However, if you're looking for a more luxurious vegas experience, this is definitely not for you.  The crowd is also much older at this hotel than at others.
We have hopefully stayed at Bally's for the last time. We stayed there because we had a yearly fundraiser dinner there. And then I was comped 2 nights with my Total rewards, but had to pay the resort fee, so not totally comp. That was as good as it got. The room was awful, one of our phones beeped for no reason so we unplugged it, problems with the internet CONSTANTLY!! More channels in foreign languages than in English. Casino horribly stuffy with no air flow, and the machines were not fun at all. We went downtown to the Four Queens to waste some time and had a blast. As far as Bally's goes, I'm DONE!!
