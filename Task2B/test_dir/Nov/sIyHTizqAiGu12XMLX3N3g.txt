Hands down the BEST buffet in Las Vegas.
Im not one to spend much time writing reviews on things like this, however I felt it was my civic duty on this one, to slightly warn those thinking of haunting this new and trendy Vegas buffet. Not that it was horrible, in fact, the food and atmosphere were FINE. . . FINE. Yep, that's the word I would use to describe this buffet. Just fine. It is in no way worth the wait or cost. Period. It is mostly buffet type and quality food. The selection is ok, the lines once inside the buffet are long but manageable; they do a fine job of replacing the food; the helpers are not always the most helpful. I  suppose its so busy because its the newest or getting the most buzz, but in reality I suppose, just like Vegas itself, the hype will die once something newer and shinier comes around. . . Please, do not be me. Do not give into your urges just because everyone else says its the best thing ever. Its fine, and if you want to impress your friends by dropping $200 for 3 of you to eat at the newest and shiniest buffet and wait in line for an hour or more for the privilege, then this is your best bet, otherwise, find something with far less people, save some money and go do something you will actually enjoy.
There are a few glaring issues that must be fixed in order to make this a five star buffet.. . 1. Several people have commented that the crab is frozen. They are 100% correct! Why has Bacchanal done nothing to remedy this? If five star crab is supposed to be frozen (not chilled; actually frozen), then my apologies. Nonetheless, I'm pretty sure the crab is supposed to be edible and not actually frozen solid.. . 2. The website says lunch begins at 11:00. I understand a small delay while clearing breakfast, but I should not have to wait until 12:00 for the ribs and other specialty meats to arrive. The icecream was also pretty late to arrive.. . 3. The pizza was pathetic. It is cheese on thin bread and nothing more.. . 4. Most asian meats were quite tough and dry.. . The remainder of the food was good, but not spectacular when considering the price. While I would return, I would only do so if there was not a long wait and all items were ready as advertised.
Came here for the bubbly brunch! Great spot to eat and drink for a few hours! You definitely get your money's worth - great food and unlimited champagne or mimosas for the brunch special! Loved our sever Carlos - we never had to ask for anything he was super accommodating! Great spot to check out while in Vegas!
Well I didn't have much choice. I don't eat pork,  and their most of the dishes have pork.  I would suggest they keep more seafood items so that people who don't eat pork can enjoy! :)
Food was good decor very nice not your typical buffet!
A total disappointment!  Literally ate one bite of each dish hoping it wouldn't be a fail...but it was.. . The food is DEFINITELY not worth the price that was paid.  Seafood was lackluster and had few options.  Crab was waterlogged (even the "hot" version was waterlogged).  . . The meat carving section was not good.  BBQ ribs and brisket were waaaay too smokey.  The prime rib seemed like it was rushed through cooking and the person at that station did not know how to cut the meat properly (cutting it into weird chunks, instead of the typical slices).  . . The rest of the hot foods were forgettable.  As mentioned earlier, you'll only have one bite of each dish and be disappointed. . . The desserts were meh as well.  The only thing that WASN'T a total fail was the creme brulee.  Although if the only thing that was worth getting a second time (or taking a second bite of) was a small aluminum foil dish of creme brulee, that in itself is a fail.. . Servers were nice, but inattentive.  Water glasses were empty for the majority of the meal and it took a long time to get ahold of anyone.. . . . Wound up going to Wicked Spoon two nights later and was totally satisfied there.
This is not what the advertisements would make you think. I thought this buffet was going to be absolutely fantastic. There was a station for each food culture: seafood, Italian, Chinese, breakfast, Mexican and dessert. It was pretty good but nothing beyond that. It has a wide variety selection, but none of the food is 'impressive', some of the food was even dying at the buffet. It was similar to going to a 3 star restaurant to receive each dish. The food lacked quality in each item presented. Even though the mimosas are included this Buffett is Not worth the money. I feel that the majority of the budget went towards can advertisements as opposed to actual food quality. We thoroughly enjoyed the Aria buffet and rated that buffet 5 stars which was far better than this one.
'Just returned back to the desserted Island from a mass fatty trip to Las Vegas and Los Angeles. . . I am still having withdrawals, not to mention drawstring pains (my pants are too tight post-trip).. . To one of the best buffets I've ever been to in my life - let's break it down. . . CONS (way less cons than pros, so let's start here):. - there is always a line. it looks like a line to get into a club, and you'll probably see some skimpy dressed ladies, too. . - that's about it. . - oh, except, you will need to go on a diet pronto. Stat. Your doctor will not be happy. . . PROS:. - they take your picture while you're waiting to get in, available to purchase. how cool!. - they give you rubber plate holders, so you don't burn your fingers - now that's thoughtful, and that's what I call service! . - there is king crab, oysters, prime rib, and a freakin' pho/noodle/dim sum bar. how can you say no?! . - the dessert bar is a huge station, and there's everything from molten chocolate lava cakes to gelatos to macarons and baked cookie blondies. . - complimentary glass of wine with you dinner. Why, don't mind if I do.
Yup... This is the best buffet in Vegas! They cater to Asian ppl so there's tons of good options! It's super busy so get there in between meals like around 2-3pm lol you get the best of both worlds that way! They don't even rush you out when you're sitting there about to explode and holding your bellies! . . I will definitely come back here again next trip!
There are so many delicious options. I recommend going at least 1 hour prior to get your place in line. It's nice because they contact you via text when your table is ready so you don't have to wait around. This is the best buffet in Las Vegas in my opinion.
Compared to other buffets across the globe this is one of the best you will ever have.  Quality mimosas and the option to have cold or hot crab legs. The desserts were amazing and included a crepe and gelato station.  The service was very good as well.  You may have to take a ticket and wait 40 minutes but it is worth it.  We did Saturday champagne brunch.  I highly suggest the brunch!
More expensive than comparable buffets but they carry more variety. I think the seafood is grossly overrated by other reviewers, but a solid buffet nonetheless.
As far as the food-I found this to be the highest quality of a buffet one can get on the strip. It has the usual-crab legs (hot at dinner) and cold during lunch. Plenty of meat selections enough to give you a meat coma for sure. I loved the fried chicken. . . Yes it is really expensive! I believe all buffets are expensive on the strip that are good, but do not go on a holiday otherwise it becomes really expensive and kind of ridiculous. . . I would say the issue for me is the long lines. Nobody wants to wait in those kind of lines. We got lucky and went at a strange time 3 p.m. not lunch or dinner and only had a 30 minute wait. I don't think I would give it such a high review if I had to wait 2 hours. . . Something else I noticed was being really close to the person next to us, to the point where I heard their conversation then just started chatting with them because I kind of felt like I was a part of their conversation even though I wasn't, we were so close I felt like I was eavesdropping but it was not on purpose. . . Overall this is a buffet I would suggest to out of town visitors. I hope it stays good.
So many options to choose from! . . The only reason I would return here is for the seafood alone. Their crabs (hot and cold) were fresh and delicious. Their oysters and shrimp we're humongous and of course super fresh. . . The rest of the food options were just okay. I've had better at the Wynn, Bellagio and Cosmo. I love my dessert and I was so disappointed here. I read so many positive reviews that I filled up my plate on the first dessert round. That was a mistake. The dessert just tasted off. . . Seafood: 4-5. Other buffet items: 3. Dessert: 2 :(
This was by far the best buffet in Las Vegas! Totally worth every penny!! they have a huge selection of different variety on foods and the taste was amazing! loved their Brisket it just melts in your mouth! and their dessert section was huge and the quality in their food tasted great!
First time coming here. Super long waiting time, but well worth it. They did offer for an additional $20 person, we could get in right away. In which, we decided to wait since it was already $55 a person. . . There was all different types of food you could imagine. American, Asian, Mexican and more. You won't be disappointed if you come here. You'll leave with a very happy stomach.
This was my first Las Vegas buffet experience and it did not disappoint. The selection of food was superb and the service was awesome. There was a ton of variety and everything tasted fresh and delicious. . . TIP: Get there at 10:30 (weekday) - right as breakfast is ending and they are turning over for lunch. You'll get brunch for the breakfast price which saves you a bit of $$. . . I will absolutely be back!
A very fitting name for a veritable orgy of food! This one in true Csar's Palace grandeur is like no other Las Vegas Hotel and Casino buffet. It is really more like if an array of top level restaurants were in one section. The major cuisines are well represented. There's a seafood section that features a wonderful ice bar with delectables like stone crab claws, oysters on the half shell and snow crab legs among other things. They also have hot seafood offerings as well. The carving station is more like a BBQ restaurant that features brisket and spare ribs along with the prime rib, turkey, chicken and pork roast. They even have slider hamburgers on little plates that are ready for the taking. The Mexican section has some authentic standbys like chicken chile verde. chile colorado, and pozole, but they also have street tacos done to order featuring carne asada, chicken, and al pastor. The Italian section has some lovely pastas and pizzas cooked in a woodfired oven, and an Asian section that had some lovely sushi, stir fried dishes, and hot sour soup that was actually both hot and sour. Plus they had a salad bar that I just looked at and an awesome dessert island that had gelato and crepes to order along with creme brulee and chocolate mousse.. One of the things that I really liked about Baccanal is that many of the items were served "tapas style" meaning in individually sized servings. It made it easier to try a multitude of things rather than just filling up on just a few things. The quality of the food is top notch. The brisket and ribs tasted as good as they would have in any Texas barbecue smoke shack, and I'm a native Texan so I know of what I speak. At any rate I ate entirely too much but it was worth it. So worth it that I will definitely do this again when I'm in Vegas again!
I'm trying my hardest to not give this buffet a 2-star rating. Because honestly if you hover that tiny little mouse over the 2-star rating, it reads "Meh. I've experienced better." And frankly, I have. Hands down my favorite buffet in Vegas so far is Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo (see my review for more about it) and taking second billing would be the Wynn Buffet (also reviewed).. . Reason why I'm not giving it a 2 is because it's not horrible; I didn't get food poisoning, food wasn't tasteless, I didn't leave hungry. BUT I did regret what I paid for and felt absolutely disappointed in choosing to eat here. I understand that they're known for their wide variety of items to choose from which there were, but the quality of those items were pretty run of the mill. Chips and salsa. Mac and cheese. Your token "Asian section" with chow mein and fried rice. The seafood section was lackluster. My cod was dry and bland. Probably the only food item I did like was their truffle scalloped potatoes. I went for seconds on that one - must have! But that's about it. Their dessert section didn't excite me. I think I ate all my custard cause it tasted like leche flan (shout out to all my Filipinos), sampled the rest of the desserts and pushed them to the side of my plate. Super wasteful but I pretty much saved other people's time from grabbing a sub-par dessert. You're welcome, Vegas patrons.. . You expect grandeur at a place like this, well at least I did. Especially with this kind of price tag, you expect tiny ass rainbows to come shooting out of your eyes as you body roll in your seat making yummy noises. Sadly, none of these things happened. I was left rainbow less and my body refused to roll.. . I would not come back. Sorry, Bacchanal. I'm probably better off taking my money elsewhere... slots anyone?
This is by far my favorite buffet in Las Vegas.. I've eaten here twice now and I must say that each time was well worth the $$$ and the full stomach. My friends and I decided to try it the first time because it had just opened and we wanted to see if it lived up to the Vegas Buffet standards; it did. Over a year and a half later, I dragged my entire family to eat att this buffet because of the positive experience I had the first time.. . It's around $65 for weekend dinner buffet (that price included tax and 18% gratuity for my 8+ party), but they have such a vast variety of the food and wonderful presentation for each of the dishes that the price doesn't stop me from wanting to go back even as I'm writing this review.. . They have several different types of food stations (going right to left from what I can remember) chinese, dim sum, sushi, made to order ramen, pho, udon, salad bar, cheese bar, pasta, pizza, mexican, the mexican fruit juices (i loved), soup, bread, meat - lamb, prime rib, fried chicken, etc., mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, fresh seafood, and dessert in the center of the restaurant. It's awesome. . . They also gave each of us at the table a complimentary glass of wine which was nice.. . Loved both of my dining experiences here and I will definitely be back!
If you are a diamond status (my dad) you don't have to wait long so we were very lucky! (otherwise it would've been an hour for our party of 13. We got the back corner table which was semi enclosed and felt like we were dining in our own private room. Def. worth the price with all the seafood and desserts along with complimentary glass of wine (for member) and champagne and excellent server who kept removing our plates! (for more)
Probably the best buffet in Vegas! Well organized express entries so you know when to return if you aren't VIP. So many items to choose from and different types of eats from all over the world. I used to think Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan was the best, since it was knew but they've come off from the pedestal a bit. I especially like their seafood section that offers crab claws, crab legs both cold and boiled as well as large shrimps not the itty bitty ones you find in most Vegas buffets nowadays. With all the options you need to plan accordingly to make room for dessert. Check out my pics and you'll drool...
Right after our plane landed in Las Vegas from Sacramento, my boyfriend and I came here to eat. . . The service was good, but I would expect it to be for $50+ per person!!! I was appalled at the price, but we were hungry and it took us about 20 minutes of walking to find the buffet in what seems to to be biggest casino/hotel on the strip. . . The ambiance is nice, and very clean. There are plenty of tables for small and large groups. . . The food was good. I think some items could have been better, but it's a buffet so I'm not expecting every single dish to be the best I've ever had. There is so much variety here and soooo many dishes to try out. My favorite was probably the Italian station. The pastas and meatballs were good. . . Only complaint is that the desserts were not good. I probably tried about 2/3 of what was on the station (not the crepes, cus the line was too long), and many were left uneaten after one bite. The creme brulee was probably the best one I had. . . If you're looking for a lot of variety and lot of choices, this is a great buffet.
Every time I'm out in Las Vegas this is one of my go to foodie spots/ buffets! I may not go to the other buffets but this one is the best one I've been to thus far in Vegas! The first time I tried this place out, it was unforgettable! My first plate had everything from oysters, calamari, dimsum, pad thai, sushi, and pasta! They have such a variety of different cuisines to choose form to make your dish filled with food. . . They second time I came here tho it was a different vibe, we had to wait for an hour ten come back to check in and be seated..... and there was no oysters either! Along with the oysters, the dessert bar special changed to caramel apples for Halloween from shaved ice in September . . Guess one thing good about this place is they are always changing things due to the special occasions or the holidays! The service is great here, but the staff could use a bit of more help to deal with the vigorously long lines here! But it is well worth the wait and WORTH SPENDING 30-50 for the buffet! Oh, and small parties of two or 3 get seated faster and get to take a photo for keepsake for a small amount of $20 for 3 photos. I recommend everyone to try this place out when you are in vegas! It's well worth the wait & your money!
Check out these pics! I still can't stop thinking about this damn buffet! Can't wait to get back to Vegas just to eat here again!
Brought the boyfriend here today for his belated birthday feast. We got there right before 1000am and didn't have to wait. Wonderful! It's $43.99 w/ TR card for adults and $24.99 for children. I wish the age for paying children was 5 years old. My daughter is 4 and although I paid for her, she barely ate! All she had was 1/2 a juice and 1/4 of a char Sui bao. I should've called to see what their seafood selection was for Sunday brunch. Unfortunately there were no oysters, which is what he really wanted. The crab legs had to do! Overall the food was good. Decent selection, but for the price I think it's better to come for dinner. As with most buffets we've been to there are always a few items that have been out too long. I don't remember our servers name, but he was ok. Not the worst and not the best. He couldn't get our drink order- 2 Reg coffees, 1 decaf and 4 waters. We got the 2 coffees and 3 waters. Then when we asked for the decaf, we also had to ask for a cup. It wasn't even busy yet either. Oh well, at leas he asked if we were done with our plates instead of just taking them.
Well, we were looking for a place to eat before a show at Caesars and thought we'd try this place. Had a lot of time to kill so waiting in the long line was acceptable but not pleasant. I was struck by the high price of $53.99 per. I don't mind paying if I feel it has been worth the price. I think the only thing the one star would cover is the huge variety of food available. Better like fish because the entire restaurant reeked of fish. When I eat at a buffet, the first trip, I will get a small portion of a lot of items and then return on the good ones. Everything that I sampled on the first trip was not worth the trip back. The desserts were good but by then I was so angry at getting "ripped off" that it was hard to enjoy. .       In short, for the money you pay, this is by far the worst buffet that we have ever experienced. After tax and tip (not workers fault), our bill was $136.73. Grrrrrr!
There are basically not enough stomaches in the world to prepare you for this meal. Let me just say, do not eat anything all day, or do the brunch and have this be the first thing that you eat because it will be the only thing you need to eat for the next 8 hours. Also be prepared to be eating for a good 3 hrs. There is so much here that you will tell yourself you won't be there long but guess what, they have different foods come out at certain times and BAM you won't be able to leave. You probably think that because of all the food and all the people that come here that the quality will be shit. This is not the case at all, the food quality was better than I imagined it. This buffet is one of the pricey one but well worth the money. I wouldn't go to any of the other buffets after this. I wish I could put into words how big this buffet is. It is like steping into 4 restaurants all at the same time. The meat here is so good and cooked at perfect temperatures and is never try. My favorite was the Prime Rib. It just melted in my mouth and so did the brisket. It was full of flavor and felt like I ordered it from a BBQ place. There was an asian area where they were serving dim sum and I was in heaven. They had a hot and sour soup there and it was to die for. The workers were busy like ants just constantly moving and replacing everything like a well oiled machine. The seafood area was the busiest. Here you could get all the crab legs you want and they are half shelled for you so there isn't any work trying to get the meat. They had a wonderful oyster shooter that was soaking in a cucumber watercress juice which i loved. At 3pm they brought out oysters on a half shell and I was so happy at this point. The desserts were crazy. So many cakes and gellatos. They had an gellato sandwich that used donuts as the bread. And get the asian 5 spiced cake so effing good. And the mimosas kept coming. I dont know if it was our server but she made sure my glass was never empty I ate so much I didn't need to eat the rest of the day. Never have I felt to gluttonous but if there was a place to do it it would be at ceasers palace in the Bacchanal Buffet.. . you have to at least try this place once in your life.
So I was in vegas last weekend and I asked my friends what was the best buffet in vegas since I haven't been in vegas for over 6 years now.  Bacchanal came up a number of times so I decided to check it out.  We went at 6:30pm on a sunday and it wasn't that busy, we got seated within 10 minutes.  One of the things that I like about this buffet is that they serve hot crab legs.  You just have to go over to the Italian food station instead of the seafood station.  My suggestion for anyone coming here is to first go around and look at all the different options, and then decide what you want to try, don't try to over do it in the first pass, its not a race but a marathon.  Overall I felt that the quality of the different food was good but not sure if you really get your moneys worth at the $55 price tag.  You may be better off just eating in a nice restaurant but if you want variety then this is the place to go.
$55 buffet?  Yes.  Worth it?  Yes. . . By far the best buffet I have had in my life, the quality of all the food here was well above what I had imagined it would be.  The beef brisket they had here was worth $55 dollars alone.  And for the price you get a glass of wine or beer.  . . They have something for everyone, if you a bit hesitant to try it because of the price, just do it, it is worth it.
Honestly, do not come here with a large group. If you do, split up into groups of 2 or 3 people. That's the only way you will be seated in a reasonable time.. . My family and I came to this buffet (group of 9). It's a busy night, we understand that there will be a wait time of 2 hours so we took our ticket and sat around picking lint off our clothes. They would text us as soon as a table was ready.. . We watched as couples and groups of 3 got their ticket and barely walked away before they abruptly turned back, 99.97104% chance they were reading the text that their table was ready, and returning to give the lady their ticket. . . DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION WITH THAT, THEY COULD HAVE JUST COMBINED SMALLER TABLES TO ACCOMMODATE THE LARGER GROUP. . . Seriously, the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars was the food. There was a huge selection and not only that, it was very filling. A lot of the buffets that I have tried previously, the food was subpar and we just stuffed ourselves to get our money's worth. Bacchanal had 5 star quality food and we didn't have to stuff ourselves, the meal was completely satisfying.. . + They have a crepe bar that has a wide selection of things you can add on to it.
Bachannel has always been the place we must visit when in vegas. It's been 5 trips and every trip was satisfying though pricey.  This last trip was the most disappointing!  Everything tasted good but the dessert.  I was looking forward to the dessert! Boy, was disappointed.  Macaroons tasted like sponge cake. None of the pastries tasted as I remembered.  Not even the gelato.  1 star less for horrible tasting dessert. Food was still good.
One of the best buffets on the strip and I've been to a few.. . So many options from lunch til dinner. Be prepared to pay $50, but trust me it's worth it. For lunch/brunch they have unlimited mimosas of different flavors, they have full breakfast, to crab legs, to sushi to pizza etc etc. .. anything you could think of they probably have it. Dessert was also on point. . . They say you have a 2 hour limit, but there's no way for them to track it unless you literally spend like 5 hours in there. So, take lots of breaks, drink lots of mimosas and get your money's worth!!
Really great buffet. Can't say if it's the best in Vegas but it's gotta be top 5. The selection of food and quality was really top notch stuff. That would explain its price per person, gotta pay for that kind of quality. I personally loved the carver station but no matter what you eat it's gonna be great!
Came here with my gf last weekend on a mini vacay to vegas and we had to stop by and eat here! this was my first time coming here and I had a great experience. I ate so much oysters, ribs, and crab legs lmfao I had food coma afterwards. The crab legs you can get it either cold or hot. The hot crab legs you have to go towards the Italian section and give them your plate over the counter and they will serve it to you.. . Oysters were fresh and the mango juice was good too. The wait and cost is worth it to me. I'd love to come back and eat here again.
You have to try this one while its soooo good. Great selection and preparation. It beats 75% of overall Vegas restaurants. Go and enjoy. Breakfast, lunch, dinner...no matter!
By far the BEST buffet I have ever experienced!! Expectations for this place was very high due to peer recommendations, the atmosphere and of course the price.  Well, it exceeded those expectations by far.  As soon as my friends and I sat down the waitress, I believe her name was Milka, was already there offering us something to drink.  The dining room wasn't set up like a typical buffet, it felt cozy, welcoming and very fancy.  But now to the best part of the experience: The food!!  The variety of foods set out was just out of this world!  From sushi, fresh oysters, prime rib to pizza (the BEST pizza at any buffet by the way)... if you want it, this place has it! The mac and cheese was amazing! Luckily our table was right next to the desserts, so I had the privilege of trying almost everything multiple times. The fudge stuffed chocolate chip cookies and the green tea torta is HIGHLY recommended.  To top off the already great time my friends and I were having, there was a tall (and easy on the eyes) manager named Wolfe that continued to check on us to make sure we were happy and enjoying ourselves.  His positive attitude, demeanor and energy made it hard for us to want to leave.  Being apart of the customer service industry myself, I know from experience that the food, drinks and atmosphere can excel beyond one's wildest dreams, but the customer service of an establishment is what makes or breaks it.  Thank you Wolfe and the rest of the wonderful staff at Bacchanal's Buffet, can't wait to come back!
It gets 3 stars because the food is pretty good HOWEVER, it's still a buffet.. . Better than average? Definitely.  Worth $60? No way.. . If you're getting comped or someone else is paying then by all means go.  If you have to pay, go elsewhere.
BEST buffet! They have quality food over quantity! I highly recommend all the seafood and I love that there's variety of food. We all have that mentality of "getting our money's worth" by trying to eat all the seafood (oysters, musscles, king crab leg, etc) but save room for the other things they offer! . . The dessert section- there's soooooo many to choice from! It breaks my heart to see them throw absolutely everything away... So try a bite of everything if it's towards the end of the day...
Best buffet! So much good food of many different genres. I love they portion many in small dishes so it is easy to get just a taste and try many new things. The barbecue was delicious as was the seafood, especially the steam crab legs. The dessert bar was amazing and fresh rambutan fruit too! They had Chinese food, sushi, Italian and southern home cooking among other styles of food available. Juice bar was good too. Service was quick and friendly.
2 stars becauses the food is fantastic. We had the champagne brunch today, and it was great. The best desserts, great meats and awesome seafood. . . We were dissapointed, however, by our waitresses behavior. . . As we were getting up to leave, our server saw us and walked over. She picked up our check and loudly asked us if we needed change, which we did not. Keep in mind you pay for everything before you eat here. Then she said "I didn't see anything on the check." It became obvious she was asking for a tip. As we left and were not walking out, she sarcastically told us to havbe a great day. Extremely rude and not acceptable when you are paying close to $50 a person for a weekend lunch.
Got there 10:20am on Monday morning for breakfast, there is no line. $28.99/person, but you get $1 off if you have rewards card. Our party has 6 people, they don't allow you to sit until everyone is there. By the time we sit down, it's already 11:15 which is lunch time. They didn't charge us extra though. lunch is more expensive. The food was great, fresh, well prepared, we even saw oyster for about 20 minutes, not sure if they put there by mistake. I like ginseng chicken soup, grill duck, dim sum, Mexican food, cocktail shrimp, dessert. Most of them are very good. But you can only eat there for 2 and half hours. We didn't notice that, until our waiter remind us.
The line was 2 hours long at 9pm on a week night which tells you this place is hot. We paid the extra $20/person to skip the majority of the line which probably saved us an hour or so. You cannot be disappointed with the variety here. There is seafood, a Mexican affair complete with made to order street tacos and the dessert island is vast and beautiful. The prime rib is okay. We had a complementary glass of wine with our dinner which was great. Not necessarily the best food in the city, but it was still worth it for the experience.
Not impressed. Plating wasn't what I had expected and the flavors of the food were not really a "I will have to come back flavors" the Italian selection was very poor to me since they had different types of cold cuts and pizza and one or two different pasta dishes. What I loved however was the Mexican salsas, they were great! As far as the "American food" I found it tasteless as well as the deserts. not to mention my colleague got sick from the sushi. Also, we had a waiter come bring drinks once and that was pretty much it, never saw him again in the whole time we were there. I would not call it the best buffet in the USA or even Las Vegas. I still think that The Wicket Spoon is on top of the list!
It does not suprise me that this is the number one buffet! The buffet goes on forever and the variety of cuisines is incredible. Where else can you get sushi, pizza, salad, sliders and amazing desserts all in one place? . The kicker is: is all tastes incredible! Nothing is buffet quality or underwhelming! It tastes like they have mastered each dish as their specialty.. It is definitely pricey! Unless you are looking to spend some serious money in Vegas, this is not an every meal place! Nor is it included in the infamous  $50 24hrs buffet pass. It is worth trying once though! Come starving, leave so beyond satisfied!
Amazing- totally worth it.....if u love seafood that's ur spot!!!! Oysters and crab legs,  mussels.....and what not....the deserts...wow.....I can not stop loving this place.....I will be back everytime now...if they qould put a 24 hr Buffett pass for only this on on the market I would b their regular customer:))))!!!! Again...worth every penny........
Dinner is about $50 a person. The variety is endless. The Asian section is the best I have ever seen at a buffet, as well as the seafood section which had crab legs, oyters, clams, shrimp, and crawfish. Come hungry.
I absolutely love this buffet. However the lines can be quite long and crazy at times.. However the food is absolutely fantastic. The food is already proportioned out so that you know that your food hasn't been sitting out for the past few hours. I appreciate the fact that the crab legs are precut and that you can can ask the chef at the station to reheat your crab legs so that they are hot. But the real reason that I love to go.... The dessert station.
I had a 50th Birthday celebration for my mother in Las Vegas and planned a dinner for a total of 20 people, and this buffet was the one I chose. I had emailed the guest services and they had forwarded me to the City Wide Restaurant Group Sales. I was given a quote for my event, and even ordered a specialty cake through the baker. . I was quoted for each adult attendee a price of $68.99, and per child $26.99. They gave me a maximum of two hours for my event of 20 people (children and elderly included), and anything over that time frame would be an additional $500 per half hour. I also ordered a specialty cake (pictures below) that cost me a total of $340.00. I also already knew that I would be charged gratuity for my large party which I was more than comfortable with as this is done anywhere you go with a large group. The actual price for an adult dinner is $53.99... RIPPED OFF and I didn't even know it until I saw the prices when I arrived.. When I arrived to the location I checked in as advised, waited about ten minutes, and we were brought to our table. There was no line outside for regular check in which I was surprised about being that it was a Saturday night in Vegas. We were taken to our tables in the back of the restaurant and separated into two round tables. Had I known I was going to have to separate my party into two round tables, I would have never came here. They had plenty of long tables that they could have put together to have the entire party I was with sit together. There were also 4 other large tables in this area that were seated in our section. We were all seated and greeted by our one server and drink requests were taken..  The first round of food has been completed and the plates on the tables have stacked up at this point, no waiter around refilling drinks and no place for anyone to get any more food without making the tables completely cluttered. I couldn't believe that they would stick ONE waiter for a large party like mine, let alone ONE waiter for the entire back area of SIX tables. It was frustrating that it was a mess, that my guests were unable to get refills when they were empty and I felt bad for the waiter mostly. Sitting around waiting for the tables to be cleaned and refills takes time out of my two hour window.. Half way through dinner my brother decides to take my niece to the dessert section to check out all that they had and let me just begin by saying WOW. The cake I ordered was a SURPRISE, the staff knew this, the lady at the group sales knew this, all my guests knew this. My brother returns to ask me if I had seen the cake I ordered...my response was no. He told me that the cake is sitting out at the dessert section in plain view, and is GREEN!!!! I went over to check the cake out and indeed it was green and in plain view. Low and behold my mother walks up and sees the cake that was supposed to be a surprise. A complete disaster. I spoke with the Manager and told him I would not be paying for this cake as it is not what we agreed on. I spent 45 min dealing with this cake situation, as my guests are sitting and waiting for the cake to be brought out all in the 2 hour time frame we are allowed. The surprise was ruined, the cake was ruined, and the entire event at this point went to crap. When the cake finally came out, we were given a knife and the cake. We asked for plates and they gave us HOT plates. I then proceeded to the dessert section to gather cold plates myself, and the manager was upset that I had to do this myself. We cut our own cake and served our own cake as there was no assistance.. Long story short, I was over charged per person $15 for an hour prior to the event that I was not told about, yet I could not stay an extra 30 min without being charged to accommodate the small children and elderly people in my party. My guests and I wasted 45 min of our time waiting on a cake that was a complete disaster. They decided to reimburse me for the cake and throw in 2 buffet passes for my next visit. Do they really think that I will ever return to this buffet, that my guests who spent hundreds of dollars to fly out and spend the weekend in Vegas will return to their buffet? This is a large company that should pride themselves on the service they provide, on the bakery they have and on the way they handle a situation that is brought to their attention.. When I emailed regarding the overcharge, she simply stated that's what you pay when we have to hold your table prior to your arrival. When I asked her other questions she disregarded them and didn't answer. When I was finally able to get in touch with her manager, her response was "What do you feel is fair"? I decided to stop talking to this inconsiderate people, and write a review on Yelp to allow others to make an informed decision on their next party they decide to throw.
Baller. . . All you can eat crab, prime rib, oysters, everything. This place had it all, and quality.  Awesome asian station with real sushi,  dumplings, lamb chops (cooked medium rare). .  SO many options, your buffet line is literally a half a block long.. . . Too much to even take in.  And for 50 bucks or whatever it was it was EXCELLENT. So impressed.
Very expensive for a buffet but worth every penny. It is the best buffet around. The service was amazing. Alvaro my waiter was so interesting and was very cultured. The food was amazing, even on a Monday night. However it was 110$ for 2 ppl.
It is indeed the best buffet in Las vagas.  I was on vacation here on November 2014.. . It is about $55 per person before tax. The selection is huge.  It is much better than Bellagio. Considering bellagio is only $40, I still think ceasar palace is better. How often do you come to Vegas?  Don't mind the extra $15. . . The BBQ pit is the best, they have lambs,  ribs,  skillets,  and ribeye.  For seafood,  they have king crabs,  and fresh oysters.  The Chinese food section was impressive too. I was a little disappointed about the sushi though,  But It is alright. . . While you are in vagas,  you gotta try this place.
Great buffet!  Great service... Until you pay your drink bill... The server who was nice hovered over my husbands shoulder making tipping extra awkward.  Little did she know she would've been treated to a cash tip.. Instead of the amount my husband rounds the check up too :(. We all live and learn...
I am in the huge minority with negative reviews so if I were going to Vegas and I saw my review I'd be like "Psssshhh, there are another 2500 positive reviews...so this person had a bad experience, whatevs that won't be me!" Read on dear reader.. . So to start, there was no line. We went at 5:30pm on a Thursday and just zipped right in. In fact, this was our first night/restaurant in Vegas and I was so excited to try this place out! The food was really good! The standout was definitely the lambchop and brisket. Yummmmm..... . Our waitress did not inform us what beverages came with the meal (we didn't ask) but I see on yelp that beer and wine are included with the price? And we did not get our picture taken when we entered. Big deal. Not the reason for the one star.. . The reason I'm giving Bacchanal one star is because by midnight I had come down with the rowdiest case of food poisoning I've ever had in my life. Yes, food poisoning, it's true!! For 2 days now I haven't been able to consume anything but water and crackers and been confined to my hotel room. I'm so sad. This was my anniversary trip with my hubs which I had been planning for months which has now been ruined. My conclusion is it was either the crab legs or the seafood that put me in this state because my husband is fine, but he didn't eat anything that came from the ocean. . . So, go to this buffet because I know you will, I'd be surprised if my review stopped you but think twice about eating anything that was living underwater. Also, I'm curious, did anyone else out there who ate at this buffet on 11/20/2014 for dinner get violently ill? Just wondering if it was just me...
Way overrated! Other than the raw oysters and stone crab everything is pretty salty and normal. . Save the $63 and go to wicked!
My husband and I were in town for the marathon last weekend. We heard that we should try out a buffet while staying in Vegas so our search for the buffets began. The reviews for the Bacchanal Buffet were so good that this was our first buffet destination stop. We went on a Saturday morning which we didn't know that weekends are their champagne brunch. The price shook us a little with being round $47/pp but we decided with so many great reviews and being in Vegas on vacation we might as well splurge. Needless to say the money was well worth the trip! The food was of good quality, so many selections from sushi to various meat stations to seafood to desserts. The serving line for each station was extremely clean, the chefs were friendly, the mimosas were endless! Our server was efficient (always bringing us refills and clearing the table) and super friendly! We definitely recommend this place at least once!
The BEST buffet I have ever been too! And this is coming from someone who isn't a fan of buffets. . . There were so many assortments of foods from different cultures... Mexican, Asian, American, Italian, etc.... Oh and you must check out the seafood bar! Personally, my favorite area was the desserts! Their desserts were high quality compared to typical buffets. There was no way I was able to taste a little bit of everything. . . The service was amazing! Make sure to show your appreciation to the chefs and servers. They really deserve it!
Hey there  fellow yelpers! If you wish to have a great chow for buffet don't settle for cheap ! Make it your all hands down experience on your chow down challenge and go all out! Nom nom. Def one of my favs!
Best buffet in town for a reason- it's the best. Most buffets have a few great options, a few solid options, and a few filler options. Not the case at Bacchanal. Everything is stellar here. . . Price is high because quality is too. Best bet is to go late for weekday breakfast. 10:15 or 10:30 is a good time to get breakfast pricing (and their bfast options are amazing!), but still be able to stick around a bit for some of the lunch dishes if you pace yourself.. . Massive selection, from charcuterie and pizza to sushi and some of the best dim sum, fresh-squeezed bottled juices,  shrimp and Jonah crab claws, multiple types of Benedicts, and a whole host of Mexican and Chinese options. The dessert stand will blow your mind, too.
Was so excited to eat here but was very disappointed with their king crab legs because it was tooo salty... Couldnt eat as much as i thought due to the saltyness but their dessert, oysters, shrimps, tacos, and sliders were the only things that is worth going for. Chinese and japanese is just cheap quality stuff wouldnt really recommend.
I'm often not a fan of buffets.. . The idea of stuffing my body with as much food in ratio to the price I paid - the idea is appalling and quite disgusting. Chalk up to the mediocre if not downright abysmal quality of buffets in the Toronto area and that's the reason for my pessimistic appraisal of what a buffet is really all about.. . However, having been to The Bacchanal twice in one week - I can safely say that all my life, I have been going to the wrong buffet!. . Bacchanal blows every single buffet experience I have had out of the water!  The selection is gargantuan, ranging from fresh shellfish to Asian, to Mexican and the biggest dessert selection I have ever seen!. . While pricy, it is 100% worth the value and the money you pay.  After all,  the strip is America's playground if not one of the world's - when on vacation, you can't doubt yourself when spending money.  You can save yourself $1 by signing up for Total Rewards however.. . The first night for dinner, we arrived around 7:00pm and was promptly seated by 7:15pm.  Surprising as I've heard that it can be as long as a 2 hour wait!  For the next 3 hours, we stuffed ourselves with nothing but shucked oysters, crab claws and king crab legs.  We hardly tried the other items that were available.  Service was great, as our waters were continually refilled, as was the pop. We didn't have to ask for more!. . Our second visit was two days later for lunch at around 12:30pm, again, hardly a wait. If anything, this time the line moved even faster.  No king crab legs, so we got to trying everything else we missed last time!   I was surprise they had Vietnamese pho, and even Japanese ramen!  While not the best pho or ramen I ever had, it was a decent try given the environment.  It won't leave you disgusted, but the soup base for both will leave you satisfied - at least until the real thing!. . Notable items other than the aforementioned shellfishes to try are:. . - the chocolate mousse. - crayfish, very spicy and sweet!. - the cheeseboard items. - the roasted duck in the Chinese food section. - the fresh cerviche. - the prime rib and lamb chops. . Bacchanal is truly an EPIC feast!
Loved the fact that you didn't have to stand in line the whole time to get into the buffet. There's a machine that you can reserve a table and they will text you when to come back to the line. The food selection was amazing there was everything from Mexican, Asian, American, and seafood. The dessert selection was broad too with gelato, flans, cookies etc. This buffet is on the pricey end but you get what you pay for.
YUMMMM. good galore- everywhere! It was my first time experiencing a Las Vegas buffet. They have food from every region of the globe, well almost. They are separated into different sections for easy navigation.. . I went for early lunch so the price was around $37 per person which was a good price but as we were leaving the line was super long so just plan accordingly cause it does get packed.. . They have a carving station which is great and crab and good seafood! I really enjoyed the paella there as well! The trick is not to fill up on carbs so you won't get to enjoy the other foods too since you would be too full.. . Would love to go back.
This buffet was okay, but personally I think the Wicked Spoon was a lot better.  We used the new virtual line system and put our names in at 4:30pm.  We had a party of 11 and were told to come back at 5:51pm to enter the main queue to get in.  We got into that line and ended up waiting until roughly 6:45 to actually get seated.  It was pretty ridiculous.  I would recommend going a little earlier if possible because the VIP members were getting a high priority holding up the regular queue.  Once we were seated, we got up and ate.  . . The first noticeable difference between the Bacchanal and the Wicked Spoon is that there is much more variety here than at the Wicket Spoon.  Although the quality of the food seemed significantly lower.  The food here wasn't very exciting, but they had a lot of the typical things you'd expect from different food ethnicities.   The food was just average, it wasn't as adventurous as the food you'd see at the Wicked Spoon buffet.. . TL;DR. Pros:. -Virtual wait line might save you some time. -Large Variety of Food. -Seafood is pretty good. . Cons:. -Seat time varies depending on the VIP members in line. -Despite the variety, none of it is particularly memorable
If you can stomach the long wait the Bacchanal buffet is probably one of the best in Las Vegas!  They think their new ticketing system works well but to me and most other guests it's a complete clusterfuck!. . While we were standing in line my friend E.L. made an interesting observation.... she said (and I paraphrase her..) in 3rd world countries people wait in line for clean water and vaccines that could save their lives,... in North America we wait in line to stuff our faces with food!!!  Wow EL. what a revelation!  I never expected you to have the depth to make a comment like that!!!  Haha!  . . ok....  I could only stomach two average size plates.... 1 dinner plate and 1 dessert plate....  Maybe sitting there watching all these people gorging themselves took my appetite away...   I kind of remember this place being really good last time I came here...  this time not so much!  . . I think it will be a while before I come back to the Bacchanal Buffet again!
The best Buffet ever, every dish tasted great as if you are trying it at an authentic restaurant of the origin. You can try many dishes at the same time, wonderful tasting experience. Waiting line was good. Highly recommended from a guy who loves food.
So it's suppose to b "the best" buffet in Vegas? A waste of money and time.  To start off with, they have a fancy kiosk system where u register for d wait list.  the estimate we would get a texted would b 8:11 pm (2 hrs wait).  But what's s point of that when they texted us at 630pm, for us to get in line (incomplete party not permitted)...a waste of technology I must say.  Kiosk did its job, but d human who manage it should have some kind of a brain to make it work in our favor. . Now onto the food,  they looked good, but the line to get food was ridiculously long.  It's a buffet for god's sake, who wants to stand in line 20-30 to get a piece of prime rib, n to make it to d seafood section that's another 20 mins.  By the time u get to ur table, the food would have been cold.  So we had to settled shorter lines which serve food that u would get for $20.  Again, bad management.  They could have done better to make d experience better for us. We paid $55 each...not worth it at all.  Never again.
BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS!. Wicked Spoon ain't got nothing on Bacchanal. What I like is that B doesn't play. One of the first stations you see is the seafood. BAM! Piles-a-plenty of crab, shrimp, oysters, salmon, seabass 'n more. Work your way down from there and find all types of cuisines well-represented. I liked that they had a station of fresh juice, including horchata. Refreshing! Desserts had their own central "island" complete with varying fine patisserie-worthy delights and a gelato station. . . We had a late start to the day and caught a late lunch. Ended up paying lunch price for dinner stuffs. Life just doesn't get better than that.
It is out of expectation for all dishes with high price..and long line . Yes, it has more international foods selection . But it cost about $52.00 per. I spent 2 hours and can not tasted all..... The quality is poor .. It is not yummy at all... The brisket and sausages are overcooked... . Even you can sitting in but has been with another long line for seafoods and prime rib line.... It is not worth it for that $ and spent time.  the long line ... It was so disappointed !!!
Hands down the best buffet I've been to in Vegas. . . This place seemed to have everything! The seafood bar and the dessert station definitely stood out. . . Make sure your come with an empty stomach because you'll need to be rolled out like a barrel when you're finished. . . Start off slow with non-carb items (seafood bar was my first stop for Oysters, Oyster Shooters, Shrimp, Crab). . . Make your way over to a few pieces of sushi, BBQ rib tips and some shrimp dumplings. Take a little break and contemplate some veggies - the Bacchanal Buffet has a good selection of veggies and salads. . . Once you're done with the light stuff, prepare for fried dishes (this is where your stomach will start to feel the pain). Load up on more dumplings, egg rolls, noodles, pizza or whatever else you fancy - just be sure to only fill yourself to 100% capacity. . . At this point you may want to chill at your table and let the food settle. Enjoy some drinks and check to see if anyone has commented on your previously shared photos. You'll feel as there's no way you're going back again, but this is just your stomach battling your mind, don't let it win!. . Before checking out the dessert island (it's huge), you may want to do another round on the seafood bar. Oyster shooters will settle your stomach really nicely in preparation for dessert. Have a couple of those and curse the gods for not giving you a greater stomach capacity. Also, many use this time to take a potty break! You can go out of the buffet and come back in to do this - no questions asked. . . Now, for the grand finale you will show your friends the true power of mind over matter! Grab a fresh plate and wobble over to the crepe station. Don't be fooled by mini desserts and gelato in your path! Order a crepe of your preference - they will look like heaven on your plate. To complete the color spectrum, add a few strawberries or other assorted fruit on your plate. This will also make for a nice photo op. Struggle back to your table and unleash your inner photographer! Some may choose to order a cup of coffee to enjoy with their crepe - but to each his own. . . At this point you should be bursting at the seams but we're not quit done. Suck your gut in as much as possible so that you don't look like a hippo and walk slowly over to the mini desserts and gelato area. Grab as many as you like. I recommend the creme brulee, macaroons, pistachio gelato and chocolate mousse. With a second cup of coffee, painfully ingest as much as you can, and try to remember the flavors as the feeling of joy won't last too long now. . . When all is finished you will feel like the biggest pig in the world and will avoid eye contact with anyone you came with. Not to worry, a few hours of walking will wear off any feelings of shame. You'll even start walking normally without having to suck your gut in to not look like a pregnant woman (gender indifferent).
I'm not sure why people think this is the best buffet in Las Vegas.  It's definitely a good buffet, but not close to the best.  I'd rank the Wynn, Aria, and Bellagio buffets above this.. . Cost-wise, this buffet is pricey.  At over $50/person, it's ridiculous, especially with the crazy lineups.  They have a nice kiosk feature which is great, but still, if you don't plan ahead, you're looking to wait 1-2 hours just to eat.. . The worst part is, how the buffet is designed, it's always over capacity.  There's a lineup to get food, after you lineup to get in.  It's crazy.  People lineup to get the seafood items, which aren't very good.  The oysters are tasteless, the crab legs are small and salty, and they don't even have King Crab during the weekdays.. . For better value, stick with Aria, Bellagio, or the Wynn!  You get much better bang for your buck.
The food is really good. There's a lot of variety and the desserts are the best in Vegas. Everyone comes for the seafood (located closes to the entrance). They have a variety of Mexican, Chinese, American, and Italian foods.. . It is pretty pricy though. $50 per person for brunch on a Saturday. The lines tend to be long unless you're a Diamond or 7 Star member. Good thing about the price is that mimosas and champagne is included for brunch. . . The service is on and off. Some servers were great but others would rudely bump into you without apologizing. . . I suggest you not let them seat you in the way back where the bigger groups are. The layout sucks so either you're right next to the food or in the far back corner away from everything.
To be honest, I used to like this place. A year later it has lost its magic. Throngs of ravenous people that don't seem like they have been fed for a week, would elbow and body slam you as they swarm the seafood station. . . Asian people who are obvi not from the U.S. Will plow right into you and keep walking, not even blinking twice for spilling a plate of food on your shirt.. . The food quality has been lowered, although the ravenous mass doesn't seem to pick up on that. Shelling out $60 for lunch, i expected Bacchanal to delight my taste buds. Sadly the only taste left in my mouth is that of the foul Casino air.
I was really skeptical about this "Best buffet in Vegas," after all ... it's in Caesar's. I mean it's an older casino ... it's not shiny and cool and crafty like Wicked Spoon or City Center and it's too easy to get in and out of (ha!) so ... how can it be suddenly THE BEST BUFFET in Vegas?. . I was extremely impressed by Bacchanal and I only came here during a week day. I don't know how they might pull out all the stops on a weekend. That would just be insane. . . I love that all buffets in Vegas now portion control, so I could have several plates of very small things and try just about everything I *loved* my tiny tiny breakfast burrito and miniature sized belgian waffle because it allowed me to try out other goodies in their dim sum and hot foods section as well as the insane spread of desserts.. . The other thing I thought was amazing was that some things don't scale well. Like it's hard to make a tiny breakfast burrito and have it hold together but contain all of the flavors of one, or a delicious moist but perfectly crunchy on the outside belgian waffle in such a small package. They really have thoroughly thought through all of their foods and the variety is astonishing.. . All of the staff are extremely friendly, although I don't get the little rubber thing that they give you ... and I forgot to carry it with me at almost all times. I love that they had coffee and tea at the table so you don't have to ask for it forty times, and CREPE BAR. MADE TO ORDER.. . The end.. . Disclaimer is that I didn't pay for this place, I may have felt differently if I paid whatever the obscene cost was to dine here or someone I cared about paid. Totally worth it otherwise lol
The buffet is great but the wait time and the high price make it not worth going. I got a ticket and when I returned for my "estimated" seating time, I still had to wait an hour and a half. Not sure what they're using to estimate their times.
After viewing many Vegas buffet reviews and hearing about Bacchanal, I thought I'd give it a try. People have raved about this buffet, stating it is the best buffet in Vegas in not only in terms of food but decor. It all starts by having to input your information into a system so that you are in queue....to pay. That moment where you are called to pay can be between 30-60 minutes. Once that moment comes, you head into a different line and wait about 5-10 minutes. You then approach the cashier where you will then receive sticker shock. Why? Party of two for a Friday brunch? $115. Once you pay, you wait some more where someone will direct you to your table. Once there, your drink order is taken (mimosas are included for brunch) and you're free to roam the buffet. There are selections from Chinese (terrible), noodle station (really terrible), sushi (it's ok but not good), meat section (good), juice section (probably one of the best parts of the buffet), Western section (try the chicken and waffles), and seafood (try the shrimp, the crab is meh) and finally dessert island (not the greatest). I will admit, the decor is not bad but not great. The food...well if you read up to this, it's overrated. I'm not a fine dining food snob but I do know when food is overpriced. If you're looking for a buffet in Vegas, well...you're better off with eating at one of the many fine restaurants on the strip; however, if you must have the buffet experience, I guess it's worth a try. I just won't be returning.
I wasn't actually able to eat here, but I wanted to share my experience with their Kiosk "check in" system.  When you first sign in with their kiosk system (we checked in around 4:30PM), you get a ticket stating your wait time (mine was 154 minutes) and the time you should come back to the line to pay and get in (8:09PM for us).  We came back at 8PM to find out we have to wait another 2 hours in line to pay and get in.  I asked the staff what was the point of kiosk check in system, and he told me I am supposed to wait 154 minutes from 8:09PM according to my ticket.  huh? The restaurant closes at 10PM, so I am not sure how that would work...  We ended up going to Wicked Spoon (no line) and ate there promptly.  While we were eating, i got a text from Bacchanal (8:49PM) telling me I am almost at the front of the line and they will hold my spot for 15min.  Even if we weren't at another restaurant, I don't think I could trust their system to risk walking down there for another 30min to find out we have to wait another 2 hours or so.   If you HAVE to eat at Bacchanal, don't trust their ticket.  Just wait for the text and go there to demand your spot.  Hope you will have better luck.
Waste of time. . Came here at 4 pm and didn't mind waiting for at least 1 hour.... There was a 357 minutes wait. No need to calculate. That's like 6 hours of waiting haha . So we grabbed the slip and went to eat something little somewhere else until our 357 minutes were up . . 45 minutes later, as we were about to bite a not so juicy burger, the system texted us that our table is ready! WTF man.... . We called and they said we can still come at 9:30 so whatever . . Then went there at 9:30 a HUGE line with all the ppl who were waiting with the same situation as ours lol . I asked the lady working there and she said the line will take 45 minutes and in 45 min everyone will get into the buffet . BUT at 10:00 they close the buffet and at 10:30 they take the food away!! . . . So you tell me we wait from 9:30 till 45 minute later and get in MAYBE at 10:15 and by that time have only 15 minutes to grab food?! . . Ummmm no.... Waste of time . . Manage your buffet better . Stay open later. Or don't take people beyond limit and tell them they'll be able to come in n wait for hours when they can't even get in.
Definitely one of the higher quality buffet on the Strip.. We came here for THanksgiving brunch so it was a little more expensive, but it was worth the money.. Bacchanal offers a great selection of food. Oh yesh from turkey, bacon, ham, roast duck to seafood.. I also like how they have those cold-pressed fresh juice in little jars. Very refreshing.. I take off one star because the seafood tends to be saltier than it needs to, which is a bad sign that the seafood is not very fresh.
Bacchanal Revi. First time I tried this buffet was about a year ago.  We were here for dinner and waited about an hour and a half to get seated which is not bad.  Food is above average.  You'll find diverse selection of food and the presentation on their desserts were quite good (like in Bellagio and Wynn).  That night I asked if they have any lamb and the gentleman told me they ran out. Food was good but nothing really stood out.. . This year we came back again to give my in-laws (visiting from another county) a Vegas Buffet experience.  It turned out to be a real disaster... and here's how it all went down:. Thanksgiving weekend pricing... $60 for Total Rewards members & $64 for regular price.  If you want to be in front of the line, you can pay an extra $20 for each person.  We asked the lady at the podium and she told us to check-in through a computer kiosk in front to give us the time to come back.  Estimated wait time is 134 minutes and our check-in time was at 5:18 PM.  According to our ticket, we needed to return and check back in at 7:27 PM.  I even left my cell number to get notified on our return time.  More than 2 hours of waiting time... so instead of keeping your money in your pocket, this is their subtle way of luring you in to playing on the casino floor and spending more money.  Then we came back around 7:00 PM and there was a huge line (BTW I DID NOT even get a text message  reminder for our return time).  We were told that we have to stand in line and wait for another 1 hour and 30 mins.  That is just ridiculous!  Of course we ended up eating at a different place.  I just hope that the line is not like this everyday. On a lighter note, there's this one lady who I think is a Diamond or a 7 Stars member who was going around the line of people and telling everyone that she can take anyone to the front of the line as long as they pay her cash LOL.  Talk about making some dough in the casino to sustain their gambling addiction LMAO!. . Ratings:. 1 star for service (the way they handled the waiting time and lines). 3 stars for the food (last year). . Happy eating folks!
Very impressive interior decoration here.  The place is absolutely gorgeous, clean, modern, and stunning to the eyes.  However, the food leaves much to the imagination and the price is quite high for what you get.  If you're going to pay $50 for a meal, you might as well go to a five-star restaraunt and buy a steak.
Best buffet ive ever been too...period! Hope they keep the quality up.
The line is superrrr long.. . Here is what I dislike, first you are told to get a ticket from the kiosk, I wish I knew so I could come earlier to get it. There's 3 kiosk, two works, and out of the two, only one printed the paper out. I used the one without the printing, and registered on the one with the paper print out just in case. You're supposed to get a text even if you don't get a paper print out. GOOD LUCK getting a text.. . I even asked how long the regular wait is without the paper, she said 4-5 hours, and this was at 4:30pm. I figured my time at 8:13pm was not bad, so I was going to come back.. . My time for party of 3 was 8:13pm on black Friday. My dad came around 7:30ish and waited in line. I got there at 7:45pm because I read it's best to get there a bit earlier. . . I asked the lady where to go, she said I can't stand in line unless my time is up. WTF? My dad was in line so I stood in line and was hoping by the time we're up to the lady who is checking people's paper it would of been 8:13pm. It was 8pm and she was fine letting us in, phew! . . The line is super long, I even went up to the front and asked a guy who was paying how long he waited, and he said 1 hour from the start of the line. . . Luckily the line was moving, so after the lady checks you in, you still need to wait in line to pay. After paying, which is $208 bucks for 3 people, super expensive, we had to wait to be seated. . . I don't understand wasup with the various lines and how people can go there, no one explained anything to us. We waited an hour total from time we got to the buffet to getting our seats, so we finally got seated.. . The food was more emphasized on shell fish and chinese food. There was a bit of mexican/spanish, but that's about it. Other ethnic food were a light touch here and there. The dessert was ok, not mind blowing. I believe this is on par with Wicked Spoon, though I do like Wicked Spoon more. It was 2 hour wait on Thanksgiving day at around 7:20pm there. . . Food quality was good, but the wait is stupid. I even asked the cashier, what if I do not have the paper, she said regardless you need a paper to stand in line. If you don't you can't. I never got a text message, and good thing I waited in line with the paper. Make sure you have it otherwise you're waiting for nothing.
There was not a huge selection of food but the quality was definitely there! The food was not extraordinary delicious but good nonetheless.. The service was great. I would come back for more, if the price wasn't so high
Pros.. . 1. Variety of food and they are good (fresh oyster, crab leg, very good dessert bar and many more!) . 2. The service is good . . Cons... 1. We had to wait 3 hours.. (After waiting 1 hr I got a text that the table is almost ready so we went to check in. After the check in we had to wait in the line for 1.5 hrs to pay for the buffet and another 30 mins to be seated) . 2. $59.99 per person for dinner w/ total rewards card (it was a holiday rate but the guy said the regular price is only few dollars cheaper than this) . 3. People can pay $15 extra to skip the line which makes non-express line ppl wait even longer
Its hard to eat light in Vegas. Believe it or not the buffets are some of the best options for eating light.  Lot's of sushi, veggie,s fish, shrimp.  You can go heavy on the sauce or none at all.  I think Bacchanal is a little over priced during lunch but in general buffets aren't my thing.  I'm in no hurry to go back but I would happily go there again if the people I was with wanted to.
