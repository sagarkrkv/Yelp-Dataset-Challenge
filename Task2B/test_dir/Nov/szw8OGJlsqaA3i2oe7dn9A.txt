Pastries were pretty good, but 5 dollar coffee and you don't have any cream or half and half right now or for the next 3 hours?  I don't mean to seem needy, but it doesn't seem like too much to ask to have something thicker than milk to put in my coffee.  Especially when they leave you two and a half fingers of room for cream .  Sorry, I mean milk.. . Did I mention they didn't have cream?
I had a pair of MyVegas dessert rewards.  We are not impressed by the patisseries overpriced desserts so we took a chance and ordered berry souffle-style crepes.  The ordering process is inefficient and time consuming because the cashiers are also responsible for filling coffee orders as well as taking orders for both the crepperie and dessert sections.  Fortunately, our long wait was rewarded with a pair of delicious crepes.
It's over the top, pricey, and the wait in line can be lengthy but once you order, it's so worth it.  I don't think you can go wrong with any selection but when I stop by, it's always the same thing-chocolate croissant with a cafe au lait.  You will almost believe you are in Paris until you turn around and see the mass of humanity all playing slots behind you.
Indulge in the best chocolate flavors, surrounded by extravagant cakes and over the top pastries. . . Everything at Jean Philip looks out of magazine spread or a tv show. From macarons to personal cakes, sandwiches to crepes, hot chocolates or a simple cupcake. If you are in Vegas you have to take time and check out the place. . . The variety of chocolate is huge. There's almost anything you can think of and the prices are not bad. . . The flavors are strong though and if you get a few pastries you won't be able to finish them unless you have something salty to neutralize your taste buds from the sweet.
This is no average bakery! This is high end, good quality, excellent presentation patisserie! Every bite is just so deciduous, you can taste the amazing flavors, just perfect! . . You have to spot by here whenever in Vegas!  And come back on your last day in town go take some home!!!!!
This is a must!!!!!!!!!! The must delicious desserts abc sandwiches ever!!!! I ordered a tiramisu delicious!!! I ordered turkey and salmon sandwich both were great. Pricey but worth it. I wish they had a shop in LA.
I am absolutely in love with this place!  When I left Vegas, I wished I could pack it up and take it home with me! Everything from the modern decor to the location, presentation of desserts, flavors and quality of all including: chocolate candy, truffles, gelato, pastries, cakes and more are all made to perfection! Rich, creamy, delicious and absolutely worth the visit! A great place to stop by for after dinner desserts, date night while in town or to simply satisfy that sweet tooth, it's just one of those places that will make you wish you could try it all, and make you want to make return visits for more! A must return to for me the next time I'm in town! So if in Vegas, or visiting soon... I urge you to try it! I know you will return to this review later and thank me!
I came here while I was staying at the Aria for couple of days.. I have tried the chocolate croissant and the Nutella brioche. Both of them were delicious the brioche was too much for one person to finish on their own but it's amazing.. This place has some of the most beautiful looking pastries I have ever seen.. It is a little expensive but I will recommend trying them out.
$4.00 for an espresso that tastes stale and burnt. I believe next time I'll take my money elsewhere.
I can't rave enough about their crepes! We stayed at the Aria for 3 nights, 4 days.....I literally had two crepes a day my entire stay. They have sweet and savory options - I tried most of them and have to say they were ALL excellent! They make them fresh while you wait, all fresh ingredients. . . The gelato here is pretty great too. The desserts are all rich and ascetically pleasing. There is always a long line for this fantastic little shop. My one and only complain is their sandwiches are not made fresh. . . Make sure to stop here when you are in Vegas, the crepes are an absolute MUST!
No..just no..no no no. . Let me count the ways.. . Service..not friendly..not Vegas like..not righr..theae people need to smile once. . Lines. .long long long..very long. Prices. .expected ly highy..7 dollars for pastry... Seating..tight..rushed..exposed.... Now Flavir...poor..these gorgious deliciously decorated little pieces of eye candy need to taste more than the promise they offer... . Imagine..a well dressed woman..high heals.keller dress..smooth skin..lips from heaven..eyes from the jungle. .hair like a movie star.and ...... e5c. You take your first kiss and its an ice cube..terrible. .disappointing. .a shame. . The pastries were..I tried five..was just super hungry..none enticed a secobd bite.... . Ok...but..I am a pastry snob
Chicken tandoori panini! . . Right before watching Cirque du Soleil's show Zarakana, my cousins and I stopped by for a quick bite at Jean Philippe Patisserie. On a normal foodie occasion, I would've gotten some of their beauiful looking pretty sweets but we hadn't eaten anything solid yet so we all chose to get sandwiches. My sandwich of choice was the chicken tandoori panini!. . They make their paninis fresh to order and my panini came out fresh and hot! I was in love at first bite. This was one tasty sandwich! It had tender chicken breast, curry mayo and veggies. The curry flavor was so good. It wasn't too overwheming but just had the right kind of kick. The panini itself was pretty big and definitely fulfilling.. . The chicken tandoori panini here is deifnitely one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.
Croissant wasn't that good. I like bouchon bakery croissant better. The red velvet taste like chocolate, but the presentation decor of each cupcake is amazing. . My fave is the fruit tart.
The mocha smoothie is so good. And also they have varieties of dessert which looks so nice and delicious.
One of the best patisserie in Vegas. We had chocolate croissant, basil chicken panini and roasted beef sandwich. I do recommend them all.
The food was food but the cashier and the other team members weren't nice!! I ordered a nutella strawberry crepe, but they gave me a strawberry crepe without nutella! And I told the lady who made it that it was supposed have a nutella but she told me I have to pay more for that! I think thats stupid! Theyre the one who made mistakes! I dont care about paying more, they just have to be friendly!!
Best chocolate croissant and blueberry brioche .  The creme brulee and choco mouse were delicious as well. Drinks are expensive so I recommend get your drinks at the cocktail waitresses. The croque Monsieur and panini are great for lite lunch. I would highly recommend coming here.
