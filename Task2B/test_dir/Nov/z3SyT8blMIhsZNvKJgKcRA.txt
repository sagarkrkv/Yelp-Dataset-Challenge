My previous review of Caesars was more fun but this one is more important. I now see my consumer experience (sleeping, eating, dancing, playing, etc.) at Caesars through a shadowy lens, knowing that the property's managers aided and abetted the unconstitutional search of a guest's room (i.e., while the guest was the *owner* of a leasehold property interest in the room): http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/opinion/deceptions-of-the-fbi.html
I spent Saturday to yesterday at Caesars Palace.   It is a AAA, Four Diamond luxury hotel and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip, between the Bellagio and the Mirage. The hotel has 3,960 rooms in six towers: Augustus, Nobu, Roman, Palace, Octavius and Forum (I was in the Forum tower).  It's a HUGE space and I initially found myself overwhelmed when I arrived.  But once I got my bearings and figured out where everything was I was okay.. . I liked my room.  The view from my room was fabulous!  My bed was so comfy!  There were buttons next to the bed opened and closed the blinds and sheers!  When the blinds were closed, I had no idea what time it was it was that dark.  Rather than hanging a "Do not disturb" sign on the doorknob, you indicate on a panel which is just inside the room if you want your room made up or not.  Just on the other side of the door outside in the corridor, the light is either red (do no disturb) or green (make up the room) or nothing.  I've never seen this before.. . The toilet was in its own room within the bathroom.  There was a phone in the toilet room.  It took me a day to figure out that on the bathroom wall was a remote control for the TV in the bathroom mirror!  There was no tub but a huge shower.. . A few times I took a stroll through the Forum Shops, which is a shopping mall connected to Caesars Palace. It has been consistently ranked as one of the most successful shopping malls in the world and is the highest grossing mall in America, with higher sales per square foot than Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California.  It includes more than 270 mid-range and luxury retailers, gourmet restaurants and bars.  The ceilings are painted like the sky. . I'm not a gambler and there were machines and tables EVERYWHERE!  Surprisingly people are allowed to smoke in the casinos so it was gross walking through them to get to my room.. . The weather was sunny and hot (27C) and I spent an hour one day by the pool.  You rent the loungers ... I'd just grabbed an old ratty non-cushioned one.  I heard cabanas go for about $450 a day. . There was a mandatory $28US/day resort fee and that includes WIFI for two devices, local phone calls and two passes to the fitness centre.  My room was $260US/day including taxes and resort fee.. . It was fun to stay here and experience it!
I've been to Vegas 8 times now in the last 7 years and this was my first time staying at Cesar's Palace. I must say I love this hotel! I had a great time, the food was great the pool was amazing and the casino dealers and staff made it fun and very enjoyable playing the games. I've never stayed at a Harrahs resort before usually I stay at M life and I will prob stay at a Harrahs resort from here on out.... At least gamble.. . 1. Bacchanal Buffet : I've tried majority of the Vegas buffets (Aria,Bellagio,Mandalay,Wynn,etc..) but Cesar's easily took the cake. The dinner buffet was outstanding. The variety and quality of food made it worth the weight gain. FromPrime Rib, Briskett to the Deserts I would highly recommend this buffet regardless of price.. . . 2. Pool: I stayed at Aria a few months back and was so disappointed in their pool that I went elsewhere when I wanted to relax in the sun and swim. Cesar's Palace pool area made me feel like I was living luxurious. Beautiful pools with great vibe to make you feel you are really living in a palace. There are waterfalls with blackjack in the pool. The best pool so far I've been to in Vegas..... I wouldn't really say this is a party type pool but highly recommend you become royal here.. . 3. Gambling: For anyone who is I to gambling you'll understand me on this. People gamble for the enjoyment and fun of the game while making money and if you lose it it's okay cause you had a great time, you pay for entertainment. I've always stayed with M life resorts (MGM,Mandalay bay, Aria,etc....) and have gambled a lot in the past, majority of my trips but the rating system and comps for mlife has become so horrid and cheap that they just don't want to give anything in return. They told me at aria you had to average $130 per betting hand to really get good comps or let alone comps at all. I used to get comped buffets,hotel rooms, promotional chips all the time and that's what brought me out but they have declined so much and never comp anything that I've decided not to gamble at their resorts anymore. I stayed true to my word and haven't...... People should realize this as well.. . One day into playing at Harrahs resorts (Cesar's palace,Paris and Planet Hollywood) they comped me a room and sent me offers as where I never receive anything anymore from mlife other than a 30% off your room..... Cesar's has a handful variety of games with very good and friendly dealers. The floor get to know your name and your story making you feel part of the them.. . The hotel is beautiful, the room are very spacious with a big hot tub and glass shower, the food is phenomenal and even though it's pricey we don't go on vacation to be cheap, esp in Vegas.. . Thank you Cesar's and Harrahs for an amazing experience.. . A+++
I have stayed at Caesars in the past and usually in an upgraded room. The upgrade was not available but because my past experience at Caesars was good I decided that the standard room would be OK. NOT!!. . Unless you get the upgrade room just pass or run! Even at a Motel 6 you get a bathroom door. I called the customer service people and they explained the Roman Tower is the oldest room set and they do not have bathroom doors. Real nice if you happen to have your GF with you. Oh yea all this for $300.00/night. If I could get out of this I would bolt tonight. . Even a crappy room in Italy has a door on the bathriom!. So not cool.. JC
I will never stay here again. We got married here, which was wonderful. The wedding department deserves their own 5 star review. Our stay on the other hand is a different story. We check in and within 5 minutes I got electrocuted plugging my phone in the outlet by the bed, sparks were coming out of the wall. After that I went to take a shower and the entire bathroom flooded. Apparently there was a bad seal in the shower. My husband called the front desk and they told us they would comp is $25. Wow, awesome. They said they would send someone right up, which was over an hr later. My mom ended up going down to the front desk and they offered us another room, which was smaller and in a different tower than all of our guests. We declined, so they gave us the same room just on a different floor. Later that day my brother checked in and he got a comp upgrade. The next day our friends checked in and they got a comp upgrade also. When we checked in we were even going to pay for an upgraded room and they told us there wasn't any because of a convention. And, when my mom was at the front desk they told her we had already been upgraded and they wouldn't do that for us again. Um I'm sorry, what? Worst hotel stay ever.
Hopefully the rest of the stay goes better than the check in. 9 people working, 5th in line, 25 minute wait. Not very impressed so far. The place reeks of smoke. Fingers crossed that the rooms don't smell.   . . The location is good. It's in the middle of many sights. Easy walk to restaurants and casinos.
We loved our room! We had a spectacular view and the room couldn't be any more pristine. Marble and granite everywhere. Who needs to leave the room when you're in a suite fit for a king! Kidding- maybe. Can't speak for the rest of the rooms, but ours was amazing! The walk was long all the way up to the 27th floor at the back of the Casino, but worth all of the blisters! Room service was overpriced, I got sick from the Eggs Benedict, which ruined my next day, but I was able to pull it together for the next night's festivities. I would absolutely stay here again. The check in lines were long, but the location and the convenience makes it worth it. My only complaint is that the inside is almost a maze- it's too big and hard to find your way out of sometimes. Can't wait to go back!
Update to previous post.  The last night of my stay was $629.00 for a run down room w no bathroom door. I get that prices are high when conventions are running and IF this room was even close to standard I wouldnt be so pissed off but it was below steerage on a sinking ship. Why the downgrade? I went to get my car that was parked curbside in front of the hotel for 3 days and although the valet guys were nice the lady behind the desk makes a comment that "personally I think those cars are ugly and I cant get on and out of them" WTF? Add that to the insane price and it came out to be pathetic stay at best. Never again.
Beautiful lobby and shipping area. This hotel is definitely a classic. It really aids in someone experiencing the vegas ambiance.
thanks to my dad who's a diamond level we got to stay here. (otherwise room rates are pricey for us) I've stayed many times for over 20yrs and still one of my faves hotels. (though stay away from the oldest tower rooms - I think Roman?) Pool is great, bacchanal buffet along with great restaurants, forum shops, gambling and center of strip!!! they also gave us free passes to the linq ferris wheel.
We valet parked our car at Caesars to see Rod Stewart in concert.  The valet stole my Giants baseball cap that I happened to toss into the backseat.  I figured the hat was black and the car seats were black - you could barely see it.  But nope!  GONE!  You'd think they would hire a higher class of personnel.  Glad it was only the hat I left in the car.  Jerks.
Is there any property on The Strip that tries harder than Caesar's?  I think some aspect of their massive property has been under construction every day for the last 50 years.  . . They offer something for everyone: the best shopping on The Strip (maybe in the world?), massive sports book, huge casino floor, nostalgia for the grandparents, The Hangover references for the younger folks, cheap restaurants, fancy restaurants, shows, you name it...  . . ... which makes Caesar's one of my favorite stops to *visit*, despite the fact that I have always had terrible luck gambling there.  . . It's a 3 star review from me for *staying* there though for a few reasons:. . (1) Unless you know to request a specific tower, some of them are very old.  If you gamble with the luck of the draw, you might get a nice room, or you might get a terrible room.  Per my opening statement, they're constantly renovating and improving them, but they have almost 4,000 rooms in the property.  It's a lot to renovate, and they have been open for almost 50 years, so it takes a long time.    . . (2) Their casino ventilation is not good.  People smoke in every casino, but the smoke lingers in Caesar's more than other places. . (3) Their pricing can be insane.  It's not uncommon for their rooms to be significantly more expensive than the Wynn or the Bellagio.  For all their efforts, Caesar's Palace isn't on the same level as the upper tier, so seeing that people are paying upwards of 2x to stay there always confuses me.  . . (4) Older clientele.  There are a LOT of Caesar's properties across the country, so Caesar's attracts a disproportionate amount of senior citizens (vs. every other property on The Strip not named Harrahs) who can use their home status for upgrades and comps.
All time classic hotel what needs to be said?
Great hotel in vegas! Not only does it have my favorite buffet inside but the staff is super friendly & they have the forum shops inside of the hotel too! Along side from that they also have many restaurants and other unique shops and bars! Come inside and take a look around of the cool greek style hotel! Reminds me of hercules!
One of my top 3 favorite casinos in vegas! Caesars has it all! I there there on a comp room. A nice place to impress your wife or girlfriend. They finally upgrade their buffet which is NOW the BEST buffet on the strip (Bacchanal Buffet) I got upgraded from a Roman to a Palace room with a nice big Jacuzzi. The palace rooms are a bit of a hike away from all the fun but free so i'm not complaining! The overall casino is good. BJ tables goes up high on the weekends to $10-$25 min. Raos Italian restaurant is great!  If your feeling italian, give these guys a try.They have some of the BEST MEATBALLS i ever had. Then you have the wonderful mall connected to caesars with TONS of shops! EVERYTHING there is expensive but a nice place to sit and people watch! They have a cheesecake factory in the mall which is awesome, i believe three floors of stores, restaurants (Joes Steak and Seafood) YUMMY and other goodies! You can basically spend all day in this monster place and not get bored!
Yelp needs a zero star.  I've been to Caesars many times.  I will never stay there again or gamble a penny there.  I won't even walk in the door.  I paid for a room, which I didn't get.  We booked 4 days with an Augustus tower room.  They put us in an "upgrade" in the Octavius tower.  The upgrade was krap, which is why the Augustus tower sells out before the Octavius tower.  Go for the cheapest room before the Octavius tower if you can't find a Motel 6...it's an upgrade.  We asked for our actual room after a night and they said no problem, real soon...we waited in our room until 4pm and they gave us the typical excuse that the current people stayed an extra day.  When have you ever changed your flights and spent an extra day...BS.  Needless to say we never received what we paid for, even after eating at Guy Savoy's.  The desk clerk said the manager would call and make it right.  Well two weeks later and not a word.  Liars, cheats, thieves...I own bonds on this company and it's no wonder why they're going down.  This company is going out of business, not because of the venue, but because they suck.  Ya, the odds in the casino are horrible too.  Never waste your money here.  I only have regrets.  I gave them a chance to make it right and they failed, I gave then another and they didn't even bother to call.  The restaurants are the worst on the strip.  How bad does it have to get before they just close up?
Scheduled my brothers birthday at the sports book drove all the way from Phoenix. Come down to make our bets the systems down not taking any wagers missed all of the games wagers. Down with Cesar!!!!!
What a blast it was to spend some time in the iconic Caesars Palace. We spent some time exploring their casino as well as shopping area, and we have to say that we loved every minute. . . The slots are great, the atmosphere was incredible, and shopping here was like being in a mall. The staff here was incredibly polite and we could see ourselves spending a lot of time here in the future.
This is my second time staying at Caesar's Palace and I absolutely love it. Maybe it is because Vegas is just fun or the wonderlust I get looking around its beautiful interior. Who knows? Regardless, this is a top notch Vegas Strip hotel and resort! . The pool is luxurious and the rooms are killer. I like the location because it puts you in the middle of the strip. You are a walk from everything you need and it is a short enough walk you can conquer it in heels!. If you want a visual spectical and a perfect location, go  Roman!
Nope. Never again.. . We wanted to stay at Caesars because we were running the Rock 'n' Roll Vegas half marathon and knew that Caesars was the most convenient hotel to the finish line. Plus, it's old school Vegas, so what's not to love?. . Lots. After arriving at the hotel at midnight and standing in a long line served by only two employees, we entered our room only to discover the king non-smoking I booked six months early (and paid a deposit on!) had morphed into a queen smoking. A call to the reception desk got us moved to a non-smoking room, but this one was still fitted with queen beds and was an accessible room to boot (bathroom not as nice). The manager who was supposed to contact us never did, so after the second night we took it upon ourselves to request again the room we'd booked (and paid a deposit on!). The third room was very nice, and if we'd been given it when we first arrived, this might be three stars.. . Only three stars, you say? Yeah. Caesars nickel and dimed me so bad I was shocked even for Vegas. We paid a (non-optional) $25 daily resort fee for an internet connection that was 512 kb per second (that is, basically not an internet connection at all). Everything was an upcharge, including printing boarding passes at the hotel ($5 per confirmation number). Honestly, I experience more hospitality staying at Courtyard Marriotts and Hyatt Homes on business trips. If I'm paying luxury prices to stay in a luxury hotel, I'd like to feel a little indulged.. . We plan on visiting Vegas again, and although we don't know where we'll stay, we certainly know where we won't.
Charming architecture and decor, great for photography and admiration. If you are planning to dine here, you are looking at around $50 per person, give or take.
A little disappointed and not whatI expected from a 4.5 star hotel.  We had a room on the 3rd floor of the Roman tower.  It seemed pretty clean at first glance but a closer look showed a lack of attention to detail that you would expect from such a highly rated hotel.  The glasses in the bathroom were not cleaned we'll (big white spots in both of them) and there was a lot of dust on the ledges and base boards.  Additionally, we had a constantly running toilet in the room.  If I called, We probably could have changed rooms or had it fixed but we arrived later than expected and had to leave quickly to make a scheduled event and it just wasn't worth the hassle at the time.  The room was starting to show its age as well (peeling wallpaper, part of the baseboard falling down in the bathroom, dents in the wall where suitcase and luggage racks had banged, hair dryer didn't work and kept making the breaker  pop and the lights go off) nothing we couldn't live with but also something I didn't expect from a 4.5 star hotel.  I know Vegas is specifically designed  to get you into the casinos and keep you there as long as possible but the lack of amenities in the room was worse than I've ever seen in 7 other  hotels on the strip (no fridge, mini bar, or coffee maker).   . . The food in the hotel was very good but also very expensive and the casual options left much to be desired.  Another mind boggler was that you couldn't get a table at 1040 pm in anything other than the lobby restaurant because they closed at 11.  We were there running a race that ended at night directly in front of the hotel and had 40,000 people participating.   You would figure they would extend the hours of at least a couple restaurants for that night; they were all packed so they definitely would have made $. . . The location was great, centrally located, Easy-ish access  to the monorail (across the street through the flamingo), and within walking distance to great local attractions (bellagio fountains/mirage volcano) and perfect location for hobbling marathon finishers.. . Overall, it'd take a really good price to get me to come back here.  It was nice but there are much cheaper options that Caesars doesn't blow out of the water which I felt it should have given the higher price.
I just wana  say they are lier, the pictures on the internet of this hotel is all fake. The stuffs work in this hotel is amazingly rude to the costumers, especially to the Chinese. ,
Great Place To Stay In Vegas Right In The Middle Of The Strip. Great Rooms As Well! I Really Enjoyed My Stay. My Driver Took Me To The Front Of Caesars Hotel. The Bell Clark Gotten My Bags For Me. I Know I Was At The Right Place. Thanks Caesars For Taking Care Of My Room. Be Back Soon!
Hello everyone. . When my girlfriend and I normally come to Vegas we stay at the MGM and Monte Carlo but this time we got to visit Caesars Palace which was very nice. The staff were friendly and very helpful to us. As for the rooms the normal rooms seem to be bigger than the normal rooms at the MGM and Monte Carlo, even having a hot tub in it! . . The entire building is very large however so navigating it to get to the strip or Bellagio can sometimes be a feat so be prepared for that. The good news is that it does connect to the Bellagio which is connected to the tram so traveling to the crystals or down to Monte Carlo is very easy and convenient if you don't want to walk. But Caesars is located right in the middle of the strip so that in itself is great!. . Have fun everyone and good luck!
Staying here for my 21st birthday celebration and it really is quite extravagant. The staff seem friendly (especially the most enthusiastic housekeeper ever), and there is a lot to do, including the Atlantis show and rows of stores in the design of an Italian town during sunset. I love the architecture and the sheer massive scale of the visuals (love Roman stuff really), including the enormous columns and statues. It makes you feel like you're in a Roman shopping and entertainment center, only it's Las Vegas obviously. Definitely one of the best casinos on the Strip.
Being a customer brings you absolutely nothing in the hotel. The rooms are really nice however they have conditioning air that you cannot stop which is really not cool.
