I'm being generous. 1.5 stars is more accurate. Quite a disappointment. Extra $$$ fees for anything. No microwave, coffeemaker, or fridge in room. Poor, sluggish 'high-speed' Wifi...waited 9 minutes for a simple page to load. (That's included in a $20 + tax per day 'resort fee', by the way.) Came back to room last night and there was no running water for an hour! Room service food order was overcharged and prepared incorrectly. Huge advertising on outsides of windows ruins what should be a great view. Simply put, I won't stay here again.
Awful hotel.. Smells terrible and has the rudest staff. Staff entered our room and removed all personal belongings after making a mistake on their booking. Security full of attitude, unhappy with their lives and ready to be rude to high-paying guests. Personal insults made by front staff instead of realizing their own error. Total fail!! Spend your money elsewhere
The front desk lady (Lynne) was extremely nice. She . Showed us how to get to our suite. The room was very clean and very nice my wife and I are very happy with everything!. Thank you!!
My girlfriend and I are on a 10 day trip from Baltimore and decided to stay at the Tropicana for the first 3 days of our vacation and booked a room through hotels.com. It is 5:30 in the morning after our first night and I have already been on the phone trying to cancel the remaining two nights here; the room is about an eighth of a mile from check in, the window shutters do not block out the light, the windows look to be single pane and do not block the sound of any of the sirens or planes taking off, there is no microwave, coffee maker, fridge, or any amenities you'd expect in a 2 star motel, let alone a 4 star resort. The "free" internet is a joke and if you want to upgrade it's an additional $10 a day.. . I can deal with almost all of these inconveniences in a room that is $40 a night, not $149 a night! THEN to top everything off, we received a 4am wake up call!!! I called the "care line" and was told that the front desk ordered it for us. Yes that isexactly what I wanted after catching the red eye flight from Baltimore, a 4am wake up call to ruin my day...
Just returned from a two night stay (supposed to be three, but ew).  My room was never cleaned while I was there.  The bathroom had no ventilation (it had a vent, but the fan was broken) and it smelled so bad - some combination of mildew and something else.  The shutters look cute, but they do not block out the light and the room is noisy - you can hear everything from outside.  The rooms are really far away from the front of the hotel, so you will have quite a walk to get there.  By the end of the second day, I was getting a sore throat and could not wait to leave. The bathroom was the major problem with the room - it had a large soaking tub, but no stopper for the tub, and the shower head was awkwardly placed (no handheld shower head here, just a short stub coming straight out of the wall).  The rest of the hotel is OK - the food was good, the staff was friendly.
I recently stayed at the Tropicana while attending a tradeshow. All and all, my experience was really good. There's certainly things I would have liked, and those things prevented me from giving the Tropicana 5 stars.. . First, a little about me... I am really laid back and easy going. Little things don't really bother me. Since I was out most of the day, I really only used my room at the Tropicana to sleep and nap. I didn't really use any of the other resort amenities.. . I got into Las Vegas on Wednesday morning. Since check-in isn't until later in the day, I decided to chat with the front desk and see if there was a way I could leave my luggage with them. They looked up my reservation and asked me for my number and informed me that they would call me as soon as my room was ready. Afterwards, they directed me to the bell service where I could leave my luggage.. . Around 1 or 2, they gave me a call and informed me that my room was ready.. . Check-in was easy and straight forward. I was on the 2nd floor of the Bungalow. The room was nicely decorated and looked comfy. The bathroom looked new and upscale. I was bummed that there was only a shower, but no big deal. The amenities were modest. There wasn't a coffee maker, microwave, or refrigerators. No big deal since I didn't really find a use for any of them.. . Everything was dandy. I was able to relax and watch tv, or surf the internet via WiFi. It wasn't the fastest thing in the world, but certainly plenty for FaceBook and stuff. I didn't have any issues with the WiFi or anything else. Water was hot. Room was comfy. TV and WiFi works. Everything seemed cleaned and in working order. All for $220 for two nights, especially during a huge tradeshow. I definitely got value out of my stay.. . I rate the Tropicana 4 stars out of 5. There's certainly things that could have gone the extra mile and made it a great experience, but I was definitely content with my stay. Would I stay there again? Absolutely. Downside was that it was quite a walk to the monorail station at the MGM Grand. Otherwise, I enjoyed my stay.
Me & my husband had a great experience here.. We we're upgraded to the penthouse suite and we only paid $80 base rate... . . . It has a cozy living room, bar, dining table, king sized bed, 2 baths, 2 toilet sinks, make up area and the best thing is.... We have our own sauna room and a jacuzzi next to our bed... Is there anything cooler than that?. . Our room is overlooking at the strip.. Swimming pool is so beautiful.. There's also a 24hour restaurant here too.. The Beach Cafe. . Best experience ever.. I feel like I am Paris Hilton
LOVED THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!. . Everyone was so nice! The remodel looks great and the casino smells really good.
I go to Vegas  Twice a month, I always make it a point to stop by and play for a few hours of craps.  A few months back one of the dealers recommended a casino host do to my play. I never asked for a host because i normally  stay and play at the golden nugget casino, when the casino host approached me and ask me several questions,  I informed him that the golden  nugget comps everything for me.  The host  then goes on to say he would match everything that the golden nugget gives me.  My wife and I decided to take them up on the offer, when i called the host for the first time to make arrangements they stated that they would give me a discounted  rate" lol really! "What happened to matching my deal with the golden nugget.  He then goes on to say after I check out he would comp 1 night  I could not believe what this guy was saying. Now I don't write many reviews as you can see but I believe if your going to be a man of your word,  you would follow through with your offers. as a business owner I always follow through with my clients! But it's okay I will stick with the casino that has been loyal to me  for several years.  I will continue to stop in and play craps because I like the dealers  and they are a great group of guys but man they need to take care of there customers better!!!!
Gosh darn Kathleen. 17 minutes to get three local tickets to JFK with cash? Don't worry, I wanted to eat dinner at 10pm. At least the JFK exhibit was cool.
I still like the Tropicana but am really, really disappointed in the pool closing. When I started looking for my replacement hotel (used to love the stardust) that was one of my "must haves". A pool & hot tub open all year. It used to be, at least the indoor pool and hot tub were open all year. Now they close it for the winter? It may be winter to Las Vegas natives but many of your guests are from real winter states and 70-75 degrees is plenty warm enough to go for a swim or to sunbathe. Not only does the pool close but they lock the grounds also so you can't even go out and sit in the sun on a lounger or take a walk in the grass. There is no reason I can think of that guests shouldn't be able to go out and sit in the "resort" area by the pool and gardens even if no swimming is allowed.  I'd love to hear the reasoning on that. For a $20 a day so called "resort fee" where's the resort part? Perhaps there should be a discount when the pools, hot tub and grounds are "closed for the winter"? No where in the advertising does it say this. I still love many things about the Trop, especially our casino host, and she is now the main reason I still stay here since to me the pool and grounds are enough to make me move. I haven't conviniced my other half yet but I have opened the conversation. If at least some of these things don't change for the better I will start looking again for a new casino to stay at.  We come several times a year, every year. Please reconsider at least the grounds being locked and allow those of us who live where there is actual winter to enjoy some sun. This last trip was quite disappointing. The pool area was opened until Friday the 14th but the nicest, warmest day, Saturday November 15 it was all of a sudden "closed for winter"? Many upset guests around that day, myself included.
Bad experience --  unimpressed so far.  My husband is part of the Hilton Honors program. He made AND paid for a King, City View, Nonsmoking room.  Upon checking in, this type of room was not available.  Even after checking with the manager, we were told our reservation could not be honored.  The air in the casino is stuffy. The room is bare bones and has no comfortable chair to sit in.  The bathroom is tiny.  We are staying here because we are attending a private party here 11/29/2014.  I would not stay here again.   Many better options available.  Terrible customer service.
