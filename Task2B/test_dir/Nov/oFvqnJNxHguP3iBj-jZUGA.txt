B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L. . You MUST see the fountain show at Bellagio - there is no reason not to!. It is free, it is right on the strip, it is very 30 minutes.  You have no excuse not to see it.. . it i just gorgeous! . Make sure to see it at night!
This is a must see attraction if you ever visit the Las Vegas strip! Day or night, the fountain puts on a show every fifteen minutes for onlookers to enjoy. I make sure to stop and marvel at the night time show because it's so mesmerizing. I love how high the water gets blasted into the air while the show is synchronized to music and lights. I can't wait to watch it again the next time I visit the city that never sleeps.
Gorgeous! Must do. Shows run frequently after a certain hour so check the schedule. The fountains run to the backdrop of music which highten the experience. Street performers complete the experience.
Makes me feel like I'm reliving oceans eleven. :) it worth seeing this at olives if you can get a balcony seat. Fantastic music and ambience. Doesn't beat Disneyland world of color, but it's very elegant . Good job bellagio.
Located in front of The Bellagio Hotel Casino (duh) on the Famous Las Vegas Strip. This a wondrous and free attraction that is a must see when you visit our town. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
I have been coming to Vegas for years and have never took the time to stand in front of the Bellagio to see the fountain show. The show only lasts a few minutes so it's definitely worth walking to and posting up in a good spot. The show is pretty amazing and the music is wonderful.
When in Vegas you must see the fountain show at the Bellagio. It's on every tourist's to do list. It's gorgeous plus it's free and runs often. Definitely take the time to stop by and take in the beauty of Vegas.
Free, beautiful and amazing. Definitely a must-see when in Vegas.
Water show is pretty. It's the same everytime so ever stay and watch the whole thing. See it once then it becomes boring.
Beautiful music and perfectly coregraphed fountains. It is a sight to see when you visit vefas and it never gets the boing the many times Ive seen it.
