I was pretty excited to try KoMex, but it turned out not really meeting my expectations. The food is great if you want either Korean or Mexican, but it wasn't that great at executing fusion flavors. Ex: the bulgogi fries were just fries, cheese, jalapenos, and not very much bulgogi. Plus, the bulgogi didn't taste too much like bulgogi and more just like beef, so then the whole dish was just carne asada fries.. . The tacos were similar. The chicken was really bland and not particularly Korean, but the pork and bulgogi were better. The kimchi fried rice was well made, but that's not fusion.. . Great service and prices. It was around $20 for 3 entrees.
The food was ok. The Korean element is very heavy in the flavor of te tacos. I ordered one calamari and two pork belly tacos. The food  has a hint of sweetness that is very different from any other Mexican joint in town. The specialty food is defiantly  one of a kind, however, being one of a kind is not always a compliment, and in the case of Komex it does not really add any level of satisfaction to the original.. . The only reason I am writing this review is because the service I received was stupid. I ordered three tacos to go and was told that it would be a fifteen minute wait, no biggie, I took a walk for the fifteen minutes and then returned to the restaurant.  [this is what mad me decide to no longer go to this establishment] I walk in and am greeted by the same person that took my order no more than fifteen minutes ago, he asks me if I will be having my food to go or dining in, I do not understand how someone can forget a customer so quick, as if I never even came in. I t was not until I told him that I was just in there to pick up my order that I just placed, that her remembered who I was. Well he then proceeded to piss me the hell off, he gave my tacos away to some other customer. He must smoke an otherworldly amount of pot because  he forgot me on a slow night at that. He then apologized and said that my tacos will be remade. My tacos were done in approximately 7-8 minutes. . . In conclusion, I will never go to Komex again, not just because the service is shit, but because the food is overpriced and is not very good.. . sorry komex dude, I just had to tell it like it is.. . PS:the name reminds me of tampon box
Interesting menu.  Definitely something neat.  I think it got a bit built up from what I heard.  It's really between and a 3 and a 4 star for me, but I think the uniqueness of the place and the pretty good prices give it a 4 star.  I'm interested in trying some other food from here and see what else I may like.
Back to get wreck, all respect to KoMex who break. Their neck to keep their service in check. 'Cause oh they combine Mexican and Korean majorly. Free chips, salsa, and guacomole keeps amazing me. She tell me there is bulgogi, on the torta or french fry. But I order only a half order of bulgogi fries, I gotta take it easy. Hate to sound sleazy, but I tease me, with a pork belly musubi. And when I grub it, I got a problem saying bye bye. Just another hazard of a fat guy.  . You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter. decent prices got you looking at the menu for the latter. But Im a little greedy. I have to order extra bulgogi cuz I like my fries meaty. Food cooked to order so it won't be there in a jiffy. My girl is picky, but she ate the chicken burrito in a quickie. If you want fusion, you can't tie this place down. But for strictly Korean, I look around
Food is okay. Salsa and guacamole was yummy! Their bathroom is really dirty tho. I wouldnt be surprised if they will be on dirty dining soon.
My favorite comfort food along the 95 corridor.  Bulgogi street tacos with kimchi and salsa?  Yes, please!
A little nervous when we got there and it wasn't busy, but by the end of our meal place was packed and had a lot of to go orders.  Loved the pork belly and kimchi fried rice.  Husband can't wait to have another burrito and the kids couldn't get enough of the tortilla chips.  We will be back!
This place was everything it's reviewed to be!  A must try in the Valley!
Service was awesome! Although at the time we ate there was only 1 other table there. We were served really quick and our drinks kept getting refilled,. . We had the kimchi fried rice with bulgogi, fusion tacos (bulgogi, fish, and shrimp). Bomb! Well priced too. Definitely coming back! Burp.
After wanting to try this place, we finally got take-out saturday for lunch. Located opposite the car dealership (high school and golf course are other markers for the same side of the car dealership). You might miss it because it's in a little corner of a little strip-mall on the same side as the VCA animal hospital. . . I chose the full plate of mixed fried rice- chicken, beef, & shrimp (so I could share it with my son) while my husband got the beef burrito. I had my rice with the hot sauce and it was quite tasty. The meats were very good. The beef was especially tender and sliced thin. The veggies were cooked perfectly. I guess the only thing that would likely ruin fried rice is if the rice were mushy; but no issues here. My son liked it too; I just had to cut the chicken into smaller pieces. My husband didn't think it was anything special- I had a bite of his burrito and it was pretty good to me (but I suspect he was comparing it to Truk-n-yaki). I really liked the fried rice, but I saw so many things I'd try in the future, like the nachos, torta, or the kimchi fried rice. If we were to go to the Meadows Mall in the morning, I could see getting take-out from here again.. . The vast menu is split between fusion and mexican. I wanted fusion, but that's me. Hubby said that there was a huge sign on the wall, stating "items are made to order." He described the inside as being larger than a hole-in-a-wall and noted there were a couple customers inside dining. The korean man at the register highly suggested the tacos and burritos for a first-timer. And hubby loves burritos. . . Like I said, I wanna try other items on the menu. So, we'll be back.
Somehow the best way I can describe this place is CRAZY, UNLIKE NO OTHER.  What's better than Chinese Food and Mexican Food?  How about the 2 mixed together:)  Tacos topped with Bulgogi, Burritos filled with Bulgogi and a side of fried rice (WTH), fries topped with Bulgogi.  Oh man my mouth is watering writing this review.  Fun, Friendly Staff and A MUST for all Food Adventurers.  Until Next time KoMex
Love, love, love this place.  The food is always amazing.  High quality ingredients,  fresh and delicious!!!!
