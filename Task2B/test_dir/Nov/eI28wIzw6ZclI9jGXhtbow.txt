Amazing show, edgy, raunchy, sexy. All good things. Highly recommend. Acrobatics are nuts and the tap dancers are rockin.
The advertisement is correct:. . "If you only see one show in Vegas, make it Absinthe". . This show was hilarious! OMG - I am just laughing thinking about it!. The two "hosts" are so funny.  There improv is the best I have ever seen! I could have listened to them for 90 minutes by itself!. . As far as the acts go - AMAZING, SEXY, EROTIC, SCARY, WOWWWW. . The acts were AWESOME!. . SEATING NOTES:. If you sit in the front row you will get picked on.. If you sit in the first three rows, there is a scene where you will feel you are in danger if someone were to fall.. . Overall, the seating is very intimate and small.. It is a circle around a stage, so there are no bad seats.. However, seating is very tight, and if you like to get up to go to the bathroom or get a drink, try to sit on an isle or you will make everyone stand up in order for you to get out.
Listen, if you do NOTHING else in Vegas, going to see Absinthe will make the trip worth it. I could've watched this show every night for my 5 night trip in Vegas and would never get sick of it.. It is HILARIOUS. The hilarity is on the level of making you cry in a fit of laughter. It is not for the faint of heart. It is obscene. Let me be clearer here: THIS SHOW IS OBSCENE. Do NOT go if you're an uptight prude with a politically correct disposition. This show will offend you. I repeat: you will be offended if you have the tendency to be so!!!! Stay away! For the rest of us people with awesome sense of humor and appreciation for debauchery, comedy, sexuality, talent, deviancy, nudity, etc... YOU HAVE TO GO TO THIS SHOW. I'm not going to tell you what it's about, what kind of stunts and entertainment you will see. No. You need to see it for yourself and then you'll get it like the rest of us.
Definitely a great show.. . Just don't bring your kids here.. . The contents of the show are nothing out of the ordinary, but the raunchy humor that is mixed in made it very enjoyable.  . . Just fyi, the seats are very uncomfortable.  They are literally any sort of folded chair cramped in a small circle around the performers.  If you sit in the front, you are more likely to get picked on by the hosts.  . . Still, I would recommend this show for anyone who can enjoy some dirty humor.
Saw this show last month and it was definitely one of the best shows I have seen in Las Vegas. The gazillionaire host is great but his side kick penny wow I felt made the show aside from the acts too.. . If you are not easily offended and love raunchy great humor go watch this show. The setting isvery intimate so no matter where you sit, it is very up close and personal.
Surely this show offers something for everyone, assuming you can handle some inappropriate humor and colorful language.  I thoroughly enjoyed every performance, with my favorite being the comedic "ballet" performed by the master of ceremonies himself, and his hilarious assistant.  There is just the right amount of a variety of acts and audience interaction.. . The venue is great in that pretty much all seats in the house are good seats.  But the small seats are really packed in and you will become best buds with your neighboring seatmates, so hopefully you land good ones!  I recommend splurging and getting the seats with tables if you prefer not to literally rub elbows with the folks next to you.
The show never gets boring! You must take jokes on the extreme ends to enjoy this one. Love the up-close distance of the stage and audience, you'd fear for the antics performers. Entertaining!
This dhow is not for the feint of heart. The jokes are crude and host (named The Billionaire) has no tact. But if you can laugh at yourself and love racist, sexist, over top dirty jokes, you'll love this show. The acrobatics were pretty damn cool too. . I ended up getting randomly pulled on stage to perform a strip-off against another audience member on a third audience member for the prize of two drinks.  Definitely go!
Easily my favorite show I've seen in Vegas. The acts they have will blow you away and the venue is absolutely perfect. It's very small which makes it seem that much more intimate - there really isn't a bad seat in the house. We got tickets to sit at one of the few tables and they were really nice because we had much more room and somewhere to set our drinks. These seats as well as those in the first and I think second rows are considered VIP so you get to go in a separate entrance and each ticket comes with a split of champagne. . . The show is also hilarious - IF you can handle inappropriate, raunchy, racist, sexist, and politically incorrect humor. If you are in the front row be prepared to be called out - heck, even if you're not in the front row everyone is up for grabs. If you are easily offended this is not the show for you, but this kind of humor was right up our alley and we loved it. We have seen several Cirque shows here in Vegas and while they were obviously very impressive, Absinthe still wins.
This show was awesome! No other word to describe it. . . The jokes were hilarious assuming you can handle their humor. You can expect to get jokes about: sex, lesbians, gays, race, Nazis, politics, sex and more sex. . . The seating is a bit tight and it can get warm in the tent, but all that is easily forgotten when you're watching the performances. . . This show has got it all! Humor, romance, excitement, and much much more! Try to buy tickets online for a discounted price.
This show is everything you need to complete your vegas experience!!!  The venue is so unique and fun.  The talent is unbelievable!  I love that everyone is packed in.  Thats what makes the show intimate and in your face!   We were in the 2nd row, but I can't imagine a bad seat.  The show starts with a man balancing on chairs stacked to the top.. Even an audience members seat was snatched.  We also enjoyed the most intense roller skaters, tap dancers, and more!!!  Penny was freaking hilarious and inappropriate,.  I loved looking at the audience faces some definitely did not enjoy the humor haha!!!  Seriously go see this show!!
Absolutely FANTASTIC show!!! I will definitely return to see it again, as it has now become one of my favorite shows in Vegas!. . The venue is a tent set up right outside of Caesar's Palace. Funny, I've walked past many times, and just never realized that it was even there! Seating is very intimate, and there really isn't a bad seat in the house. We had the cheapest seats (we received tickets through a timeshare offer), but still got a great view of all of the action. Now, those cheap seats were rather uncomfortable, but once the show gets going, I didn't notice (much).. . The show itself is formatted like a traveling circus, with lots of acrobatics and dancing... And lots of raunchy jokes!! The two "hosts" play very well off of each other and the audience. Be forewarned, if you are easily offended or don't like hearing cursing, racial, or sexual references, you should skip this show, because there are LOTS of those! Additionally, if you're seated near the stage, there is good chance that you will be picked on, called out, joked with, or even called on stage!. . The acrobatics and acts are pretty darn amazing! True, this show might not have the elaborate staging, costuming, or production value of a Cirque show, but the talent and skill level of the performers cannot be denied. My favorite act was the tap dancers, but all of them were tremendous.. . Definitely go to see Absinthe- and then go see it again!
Hands down the ultimate Vegas show to see. There is X rated Humor throughout the show, but you won't stop laughing! The acts in between the Humor range from excitingly acrobatic, to sensually intriguing. A mix of Cirque de Sole acrobatics, Burlesque sensuality, and Vaudeville humor. Get ready for the funniest night of your life!!!!!
I really enjoyed this show! It was a cross between a circus, burlesque show, and stand up comedy. The setting is very intimate and every seat is close to the stage.. . The performers were amazing and they had a mix of events. If you are easily offended, then stay away. However, if you love a good roast, amazing acrobatics, and an overall great time, I highly recommmend Absinthe!
I've seen almost every show in Las Vegas and this is my favorite.  The hosts are fantastic and their humor is raw and simply "my style". The acrobatics pleasantly surprised me especially combine with the satire used throughout the performances.
My father and I saw Absinthe last night. We laughed so much and were amazed with the performances. A show we'll never forget. As other reviews say, if you are easily offended, don't like cursing, or do not have an open mind this is not the show for you.
Do you want to be entertained and feel like part of the act?  This is your show.  Are you sensitive to crude humor and sexual jokes at the expense of others?  This isn't your show.   In a quaint tent on ceasar's palace property, this show entertains.  The only draw back is that I wished the show did not end.  Highly recommend this show. I had vip seats but it looks like all seats are awesome in the tent.
Pretty much laughed from the second we sat down until the show was over. Haven't laughed that hard in an eternity!  The acts were great, except for the hula hoop girl. Great time, easily worth the money.
Hands-down!! The best show i have seen that combines stand-up comedy with some mind blowing acrobats. Whats unique about the experience is you feel like sitting in a circus. The stage is small & have seats surrounding it. Be brave to sit jn front 2rows. A must see
BEST SHOW EVER. If you don't like this show, I don't think we can be friends. I still laugh out loud every time I think of the show. My face hurt from laughing so much, my eyes couldn't stop tearing from the unbelievable jokes! Amazing acts in between outrageous raunchy banter between the hosts. Do not come here with children or sensitive people. Every race gets joked about and its outright hilarious. The setting is very intimate and creates a wonderful allure.
