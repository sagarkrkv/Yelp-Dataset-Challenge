This is not a bad airport, not like I was really trying to get to know this place, i did have a nice layover.  My problem is, I don't think there was an easy way to get too downtown or other spots from this airport without a cab or bus.. . At least other airports I have been in had a rail system that you could catch and get to the city where if you have a layover of 4 - 6 hours you can enjoy yourself outside of the airport and make it back in plenty of time.. . As you know I am a foodie, so I am looking for an airport to provide that and this one has a lot of places to eat, however, none that I saw that would  make me want to sit and spend $20.00 for a burger and soda.  I am not a fan of most places to eat at in an airport, but I am somehow feeling, if I went to LAX or Newark, it may be different?. . I really couldn't find anything exciting to do, to occupy my time.  They did have mobile phone charging stations for your phone which I liked, I can't remember if there was free Wi-Fi or not, I think they did havefree Wi-Fi and there is where things ended for me, I am not an airport lover, even though I like to travel, I want to keep it moving.. . This place is better than a lot of others I had been in.  I would want to have a long layover here, before some of the other airports that I want mention.
This place is large. Good luck if you land at terminal C and need to get to E. Get your running shoes on.. That said, this is a major hub and has decent food and shopping places. There are rocking chairs in the main terminal which is cute and there is an army of folks to help you find your way if you get lost.
Avoid this airport. Had a connecting stop here on our way back from Mexico and hated every minute of it. Had to collect our bags and go thru security again was a huge pain in the rear. After that no real food in the entire E concourse. Creepy bathroom attendants handing out Listerine and mints. Over crowded tiny gates with no place to sit or charge a phone. Any review that says this place is great seriously has not been anywhere. CLE, PIT, ORD, LAS, LAX, PHL even ATL is better than this shack of an airport.
I recently returned to this airport since I finally had a reason to travel to Charlotte again!. . While I'm keeping it at 4 stars, let me list the ways it is an awesome (and convenient airport):. 1) It's clean. 2) The main terminal is home to all of the main airlines and therefore if you're flying out with someone else, you can still hang out together prior to their flight departing. 3) They have TSA pre-check and also randomly select people (like yours truly) to try it out.  No need to remove your shoes or 3 ounce liquids!. 4) Plenty of charging stations. 5) A few small eateries so you can at least get something quick before your flight
Get ready to walk or run, whichever. I have flown in and out of CLT about 1000 times, usually on a connection. CLT is very large, and you will use about 10 moving sidewalks, and escalators. They do have nice rocking chairs spread throughout, however I doubt you will have time to lavish the slow life. The food is okay at best, mostly fast food, as all airports. . . The 2 stars for me comes from the massive delays on the runway. You WILL sit on the airplane in a big huge line waiting to take off, or you will wait for an open gate for your plane to park. That gets annoying. In addition, the runways are really long, so it makes for a LONG taxi. . . I always joke and say when you are flying from CLT you will feel like the plane is driving to the destination not flying.
Painful getting in and out of here with the construction and insane traffic.  For its volume,  airport is awfully spread out.   Seating is far less plentiful than it should be.  . Must create a lot of jobs here though. I took this picture after watching the folks all hanging out, chit chatting many many times.  I'm betting their supervisor thinks they're actually busy helping people.  Ha!  Right after i took this picture,  a 4th employee joined these 3 having nothing to do but take up walkway space.    . Not imprrssed by so many aspects of this airport.
As far as large "hub" airports go, yes it it large, yes you may have to walk but it's a hub and walking is healthy.. . For those of you who prefer a little less walking, CLT has installed moving side walks throughout to expedite and reduce some of the required pedestrian walking, but again it's a bit of a trip but not horrendous.. . Plenty of food!! Seriously, Yelp could host a restaurant hop as each wing has plenty of eateries, small stores, and amenities. . . You will not be disappointed if you pass thru or make your final here.
We arrived an hour early for a domestic flight and security was so slow that I had to run to catch my flight.  Their excuse?  "Some time are a little slower than others.". . Advice to passengers:. Arrive AT LEAST an hour and a half early.. . Advice to the airport:. Get your act together.
Charlotte Douglas International Airport is a complete madhouse, but the cuisine is off the chains. . . I had a lay over here and was shocked at the sheer volume for a small market city. You would be forgiven if you mistook this airport for LAX or ORD, it is that busy. Huge lines and very few charging areas for your cell phone will frustrate even a seasoned traveler. . . The food choices however are commendable. If you are hungry you owe it to yourself to seek out Carolina Pit Barbecue in the main terminal as it is the damn truth. Smoky, tender and so moist... truly delicious. A small piece of heaven in a travelers hell.
How could I not review my favorite airport? CLT it the best hub in the US. its a walking airport that has lots of moving walkways. I'm as swift as an NFL Running Back in this place but throw in those walkways and I'm Hall of Fame material. CLT has many cool places to eat and drink and the price points are reasonable. The waiting areas are always clean and there's no tattered seats. You can always find an outlet to charge your electronics and the bathrooms are always clean. One note is (and this is just a personal observation) I'm not a big fan of the bathroom attendant. I'm not looking for pleasantries when I'm having a whiz. Really! who eats mints from the toilet? GROSS! The true fact is these guys keep the lavatories clean. I am just not chatty when I'm peeing.. On the occasions when Charlotte is my destination the baggage claim is super fast and efficient. Security is never a hassle and the check in at the ticket counters are friendly and always super nice.. I normally fly 1st class so we get an elevated level at the counters anyway. You should try it, nothing beats getting hammered on a 6am flight to Tulsa.. CLT is in my opinion the best big hub airport in the country.
The airport in general gets a solid 3 stars (A-Ok)... but the staff here in all aspects cranked it up another star. I flew in via South West and out, via American. And all the staff, from the gate personnel to the guy mopping up the bathrooms greeted me and wished me a great day. I was even asked by a young girl employee, who was apparently on a break of some sort, if I needed any assistance (as I am sure I looked pretty lost). She went out of her way to make sure I had a good experience and that says a lot.
It's a nice airport to have a layover in. Free wifi is only for 45 minutes but there are tons of eateries, shopping and even a spa. . The only thing that sucks is if you have a short layover and have to run from one end of the airport to the other to make your plane.  It's a HUGE airport.. On my layover on my way out I did get to enjoy a great lox sandwich at Einstein Bros Bagels.  . On my way back I had 15 minutes to get to my plane.  I suppose I should have asked one of the carts for help.
I was told this was a small airport so I went mentally prepared.. . Boy was they wrong! Yes it may be smaller than ATL airport but I love that they have great options to choose from with food. Not to ass Charlotte is one of my fav places.
Great aiport that loses two full stars because f***ing bathroom attendants. Air travel and the airport food isn't expensive enough? We need to remember to bring singles for a guy standing by the sink doing nothing we can't do ourselves? Except then there's that creepy guy who stands in front of your stall while you're trying to travel deuce...
I'm bumping Charlotte-Douglas up to a three...it's almost to a 4-star level, but I'll refresh this review once they've finished all the renovation and construction.. . After two years, they finally finished and opened the new Hourly Parking garage, which allows you to park right near the terminal if you are picking up or dropping off someone. Yeah, a novel concept, right? Well, it may seem that way for Charlotteans, considering they haven't had a parking lot within walking distance to the terminal in those two years.. . Haven't connected through CLT in a while, but I can't imagine too much has changed. It was always adequate for connecting and layovers, but nothing to write home about.. . They are working to modernize this airport...it is showing signs of being in the 21st century...hopefully they will wrap up construction soon and it can function as such.
Not a bad layout for a large airport.  Lots of convenience here.  Lots of places to shop and eat which makes it nice if you're having to lay over for more than an hour.  I don't like monster airports.
This is one of the better airports in all of 'Merica.  I may biased by the fact that I live in Charlotte, and frequent this place often, but the same cannot be said for LAX, when SoCal was my old stomping grounds. . . TSA folks here are really nice and not complete jerks like at other places.  It's sweet when they ask questions like, "Heading home for the holidays?" Or "Really like your man-purse! Does it fit all the man-ssentials on chic guy needs?"  Despite convo, they are pretty quick and getting past security doesn't take forever. . . Might have to buy a plane ticket to simply enjoy the food that they have here.  Big daddy's burger is really good.  Hisso sushi hits the spot. And the food court has many options, with someone on the piano tickling the ivories.  Then, head over to the rocking chairs and relax.  You won't want to leave - and some folk look like they've been there a minute!. . But you gotta love the parking.  $5/day long-term parking is brain-dead great option.  Also if you forget where you park, and it's really late at night, and you keep her good spirits, she'll drive you around to each lot really slowly and help you find your car! There's also a bunch of affordable parking options as well. But at $5, tough to beat. . . dmo out
Totally passable. Clean and compact. Not many amenities. Good place to connect to other lathers airports.
