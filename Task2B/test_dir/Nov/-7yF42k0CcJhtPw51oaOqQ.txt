Restaurants don't provide many gluten free or veggie options. Elevator nazis are rude. Wifi in rooms is incredibly slow. This place is stuck in 1998
Most of the hotels/casinos in Vegas are basically the same if you're just looking for a place to crash after a night of partying/gambling. However, if you're looking for good service and good food, then you'll have to fork out a bit more. . . Bellagio is one of the best hotels on the strip because 1. it is right in the middle of the strip, 2. it's got a beautiful water fountain show. For some reason, no one is immune to the magnificent display. 3. Plenty of 5 diamond restaurants, and 4. The Forum shop is right across the walkway at Caesars Palace. Well, that's all I really care about, food and shopping. It's a beautiful hotel with fantastic views. . . On the downside, if you don't get a fountain view room, don't bother staying here. Too much foot traffic, very crowded, and not kid friendly. we only stayed here because our little ones love water fountains, waterfalls, and anything water related. . . We stayed here last xmas and they were out of suites with the fountain view so we booked 2 rooms. unfortunately, the rooms were not connected which is my only complaint, but at least we got our fountain view. Pretty much stayed in our rooms the whole time. tried to eat at the buffet and one of the upscale restaurant twice, but it was too smoky for our little ones so opted for room service instead. They really do live up to their 5 diamond standard when it comes to food.
Worst service on the strip! This is one of the priciest hotels on the strip and it was my first time in Vegas so I wanted to get. The best experience. First the checking in person gave me the rudest and snobbiest attitude and some how charged my card 3x for 500 dollars. The. I get to the room there are dead bugs on the floor and curtain. I called to speak with a manager nothing was done. Thought the whole stay the staff kept ignoring out request like if we didn't exist. I called the manager to tell them they had charged me 3x all he said was they would put the money back in 10 days. We didn't enjoy our first time in Vegas and it was all mainly because of the bellagio. Don't be fooled by the name. And to top it all off we reserved a table with bottle service at the bank night club and they wanted to force us to buy 2 bottles of sky vodka for 1,500 dollars. We only wanted to buy one so they kicked us out of the club with security. PLEASE IF U WANT GREAT SeRViCE DO NoT STAY AT THE BELLAGIO. HoRRIBLE EXPERIENCE.
My review is based on a group reservation for over 26 people that were sent here in October to attend a conference. Their group sales department is slow to respond at times, has a hug lag time to update the rooming list if check-in/check-out dates are adjusted, and they lack of follow through is horrible i.e. to ask for the proper credit card authorization forms from their customers is a step completely missed in my process. They do not seem to truly care about you as a customer and we spent approximately 20,000 within 2 nights and 3 days between 26 people (company-wide, we were 58 in attendance). The only way I would ever book a group event here again is if the conference was here. I would much rather be at one of the newer venues or at the convention center. Additionally, I gave them plenty of time for follow up as everyone makes mistakes or gets busy but they just didn't care about the mistakes that happened with our group reservations.  Additionally, this review is not based on their rooms or facilities - it is merely based on my experience with their group sales department  and on that note alone, I would not personally visit this casino or resort again, and will avoid them for group travel as much as possible --- only if I absolutely have to book people here in other words.
We stayed in a premier fountain view room. It was directly overlooking the fountains on the 28th floor. The view was perfect and the tv played the fountain music every time it came on. I really can not explain how great this view was. . . The room itself was nice, nicer than caesars for sure. One complaint is that there are no plugs anywhere near the desk... I mean really? Anyways, it's a nice/fancy hotel and these rooms had a great view.
Don't stay here!  Disgusting rooms for a lot of money!  My husband and I recently stayed here for his 35th birthday for one night.  Since it was a special occasion, we decided to splurge on the room (nearly $350 for a king, fountain view room - that's with the M Life discount).  We live in AZ and typically visit Vegas 4 times per year, so this was not our first time here.  . . Our first room was 16070.  Upon walking in, the room reeked of mildew.  It smelled like the carpet had been flooded for weeks and then dried off and put back to use.  We called the front desk and they moved us very quickly to a different room just down the hall (16048).  This room did not smell....or so we thought.  After being out and about and returning to our room after midnight, we just wanted a good night's rest.  We climbed into bed and realized that the sheets and bedding all reeked of mildew as well!!!  DISGUSTING!!!  Seeing as it was so late and we were exhausted, we did not want to call housekeeping and wait for them to strip our seats or have to pack up and move rooms once again.  So, we both slept uncomfortably fully clothed.  Isn't the purpose of a hotel to provide a comfortable night's stay?. . Also, if you choose to stay in a fountain room, they do not tell you that you will hear the music from Drai's day and night club across the street at the Cromwell all day and all night long (until 4am).  It would have been nice for someone just to inform us of this and give us a chance upon check-in to switch rooms.  . . I called guest relations to complain about my stay.  What did they offer me?  An upgrade to a junior suite for 2 nights if I came back and paid to stay in a standard room.  This is just ridiculous.  I would never return to the Bellagio for $350 per night ever again.  I was never offered any type of discount or compensation for my horrible experience.  This hotel is supposed to be a 5 star hotel.  Clearly, neither it's standards nor customer service are 5 stars.  . . Save your money and stay somewhere else where they value your loyalty and money.
I've never stayed in the hotel as a guest, but always frequent it when in Vegas for the table games, shops, and the O Theater! It's a great show and I would highly recommend seeing it, even though it's one of the pricier ones. It's also one of the classier casinos so it's more enjoyable to play games here than at some of the neighboring resorts.
The Bellagio is exactly what everyone says it is. It's beautiful. It's classy! The conservatory is a must see! I will say that I had more fun with the girl friends when we stayed at Planet Hollywood because the crowd there is much younger and stayed up much later. The crowd at the Bellagio was a little more serious and it got quiet around 2 am. I should also factor in that we stayed here during the week, not a weekend. But the overall experience was exactly what was expected and I wouldn't change anything. I definitely recommend staying here. Be prepared that the lines to check in are very long, though (as they are at all popular casinos). It seems to be a little bit smokier here, too. Also, they "upgraded" us to a newly renovated suite, yet it wasn't exactly anything more spectacular than the regular room. It was the same, but probably with a newer flatscreen TV, and that's all.
Gorgeous setting. The seasons really show in decor. Feels like being in another country sometimes it's so fairy tale like.
This is by far my favorite place on the strip. The energy at the Bellagio is radiant and I always feel happy and relaxed whenever I'm spending time here. The casino is huge and there are a nice variety of games. It's also very clean and well kept. .   My favorite thing is the interior design with this hotel. There's a indoor botanical garden that is absolutely magnificent and they change it every season. There's also floral blown glass on the lobby ceiling. It's breathtaking. Outside they have a huge water design with fountains and lights. Every night they do a water show where there's music, fountains shooting up and lights to go along with the show. LOVE this place. It's gorgeous. :)
When the Bellagio first opened in 1998, it was the grandest of the grand hotels on The Strip.  Their attention to detail was stunning, and there were so many unique aspects of it that still remain today: the conservatory, the ceiling art at the reception desk, the art gallery, the fountains, their approach to dining, etc.  . . Sadly, time has caught up with the Bellagio a bit, and it has lost some of its luster.  As other reviewers have noted, you might see cracks in the facade, tears in the carpet, or have the occasional bad service experience.  It's like going back to Disney World as an adult, where the magic you may remember from years ago just isn't the same now.  . . With that said, pound for pound, the Bellagio still offers the most things for the most people.  It has great pools, gambling (though note that table minimums are slightly higher than most places on The Strip), shopping, shows, gelato!, and more non-gambling activities than most.  It has the perfect location, where it's in the middle of everything.  If you're coming with a diverse group of people (maybe a family gathering with lots of age groups?) who will meet for dinner but otherwise have completely separate vacation experiences, the Bellagio is probably perfect for you.  . . It saddens me a bit to only give the Bellagio 4 stars... it's kind of the #2 resort on every category though.  The newer hotels have a narrower focus than the Bellagio, so they can win on dining or shopping or pool or gambling or scent or room quality etc.  They're all "OR"s though, as newer places have probably learned from the Bellagio just how hard and expensive it is to try to be #1 at everything.
Excellent experience. Sharon upgraded my already upgraded room.  Next thing I knew, doorbell rings and walks in a server with a bottle of wine.  Also received a 100 dollar certificate to spend on anything I want along with $120 in breakfast certificate.  . . All this is thanks to American Express card.
We stayed here for almost a week for a work event and it's amazing! One of the best infrastructure in Vegas. You can't miss the water show when you're in vegas, it's a must! We ordered bfast in bed and it was awesome, really yummy! Fast service. Only thing is We didn't have a lock in our bathroom, I feel like a housekeeper will come in while I'm taking ashower in the morning lol. Other than that everything else is excellent. Will definitely be staying here again.
First time staying at the Bellagio.  Booked a standard room and threw $20 in for the girl at check out and got a fountain view room.  Overall the room was fantastic.  You cant beat the location either.  One thing though, $12.50 for a rum and coke???  It is vegas so i guess you can suck it up.......great experience.  The Bellagio is my go to hotel on the strip from here on out.
If you want to stay at the most luxurious place on The Strip, Bellagio is your place. It's beautiful, classy, and it has a lot of fun nightlife/restaurant options!. . Check out Lily Bar & Lounge for a classy, relaxed night or The Bank Nightclub or a fun night out clubbing.
The Belligio is beautiful and luxury for the best!. The water fountain show is beautiful and the inside of the casino is just as breathtaking!
What a wonderful, amazing wedding experience!!!  We would do it all over again in a heartbeat!  Araceli Munoz was our wedding coordinator and she did such a great job!  She exceed our expectations!  I live out of town and so all communication was done via email.  I sent over pictures after pictures of what I wanted for my bouquet, bridesmaids, groomsmen, cakes, etc and everything was done perfectly!  Could have not asked for a better place to get married.  The fountain upgrade was worth it completely!  It was the best day of our life so far and everyone just did a fabulous job!
Fans of Jaime McGuire's Beautiful Disaster novel have to stop here! Take in the ceiling and enjoy yourself like Travis and Pigeon.
In my eyes this is by far the best hotel and casino on the Vegas strip. From the free parking to the slots, this hotel has everything you need and more. We spent a ton of time just watching the fountain shows, cruise through their lobby, and exploring the casino.. . We didn't have the pleasure of staying at the hotel, but we have already talked about traveling back to Vegas and staying in this hotel. Kudos to the staff here especially whom ever designed the fall exhibit in the lobby courtyard.
I'm disappointed in the housekeeping quality.  We booked a fountain view room, nice view, but bed sheet was not clean.  I asked housekeeping to replace the sheet, but after 20 minutes and 2 calls they finically found someone to give me new sheet.  I didn't expect to change bed sheet at a 5 five star hotel.
The Bellagio is just an absolutely gorgeous and well-kept hotel and casino. If you have $$$$$, you will love it. For the rest of us, it's a nice place to walk through. The rooms are great. The gaming options are great. The restaurants are awesome. The spa is awesome. But again, all for a big, giant price tag. But if you can splurge, this is a fabulous place to do that. But either way, a beautiful property to walk through and check out. From the fountains to the rotating garden area to the Chihuly sculptures, it's quite pretty.
I had been looking forward to staying at The Bellagio Hotel for over 10 years, I once thought it out of reach. I still hold it in high regard and think it is one of the best hotels on the Strip. But after having stayed there for a weekend, the romance has worn off, it's just another hotel, and I doubt I will ever stay here again.. . I wanted a transformative experience, impeccable service, and memorable experiences that confirmed what I had always believed The Bellagio to represent.. . But alas, I came away with more than a couple of sub-par experiences.. . Throughout our entire stay, this hotel was super busy. At any hour. The minute we got out of our elevator, there were hoards of people, of course it was worse at night. If you want a little space wandering your hotel, this is not the place to stay.. . I had two nights booked, separately so I called ahead to make sure the reservations could be combined and we wouldn't need to change rooms. But we showed up and still had to have the reservations combined into one stay. And even that didn't stick. The next day we were locked out of our room mid-day because the keys for the first reservation stopped working. A 10 minute wait and security let us into our room. A call to the front desk brought a promise of new keys, delivered within 30 minutes. An hour later, no keys. Another call and the front desk said, "you'd better come down to get them". Worse, the front desk clerk giggled at me when I told her I'd had to wait an hour for naught. No apology. Not a big deal, right? Keys can be a problem, no? I agree, it's how it was handled.. . Our room was nice, but not spectacular. The room we paid for could have been on any floor between 9 and 28. We were on floor 11. That was disappointing. The front desk clerk should have listened when I told him I had wanted to stay here for many many years, he could have provided us the best possible experience, but no, he didn't. The room was well done, nothing out of place (apart from a bag of mini bar snacks left opened). The bathroom was the best part, large with a nice-sized glass shower. I was also disappointed that our view of the fountains could only be taken in when we huddled by the window; I'd wanted to sit in bed and watch the show!. . We spent some time by the pool. It was early November and not that warm, but we weren't the only ones there. Service was non-existent! Others were served but no staff ever came to ask for our order.. . We faced the Fountains (Fountain Deluxe Room) and one terribly surprising aspect of our room was noise! Between midnight and 4 AM both nights during our stay, noise from the club in the hotel woke me up. Thump thump thump for a few hours. Another surprise was noise in the hallway. Both nights there were very loud groups of people hanging out in the hallway for more than a few minutes. I probably should have called the front desk. It was just surprising for a hotel of this quality that there was so much noise coming from outside (the nightclub was directly below our room) and inside (the hallway).. . Our housekeeper was the same person over three days. She was very kind and gracious. We sought her out when we left to thank her for her service.. . Perhaps when one day money becomes no object, I will return to The Bellagio. But for the immediate future, there are many nice hotels along the Strip that will provide just as comfortable accommodations for a much fairer price. I'd really hoped, spending such a considerable sum, that we would have been treated as special, valued guests, but we weren't, we were just a couple of other guests in a huge hotel on a busy weekend.
That place is cool! always play there whenever i go to Vegas!
Really can't complain about this hotel. It is by far the best hotel on the strip for the price you pay. The staff are friendly and the casino is nice (although a little pricey). I wouldn't recommend the breakfast buffet as it is too expensive if you can only eat a small portion in the morning like myself. Try to get a room with a fountain view it's worth the upgrade. I went to the spa 3 times during my stay and it is by far one of the nicest spas I've been too, note each visit is 30 bucks.  I Will continue to come to Vegas and will continue to stay at the Bellagio!
Nice hotel, and nice rooms, but we asked for a fountain view and we got instead a pool view but really nice and good service
