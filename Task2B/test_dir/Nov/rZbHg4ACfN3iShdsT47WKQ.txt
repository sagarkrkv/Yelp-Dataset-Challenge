I have been here several times before but today was the first time I have eaten here. I love the happy hour buffet on Fridays. The cornbread served at the beginning was excellent. I had the pulled pork sandwich and macaroni and cheese as the side. The pulled pork was great but I didn't care for the mac and cheese. The pasta was overcooked and mushy. The fries were great though. Thr donuts at the end were really good too. Our waitress was very friendly and made sure we had everything. I would definitely go back!
I love Bobby Q! The food is delicious. We went tonight, knowing it would be busy, and waited over 40 min to be seated at a high top table in the bar. We had a great server who was very friendly and attentive. Got our waters quickly, followed by the delicious cornbread. I usually order the pulled pork, but this time I decided to get the pulled bbq chicken sandwich with mac & cheese. Didn't take long to get our food. Requested the regular BBQ sauce. The food was good, especially the mac & cheese which is very rich and yummy. Was interesting to see some vapor coming in from a fog machine in the adjacent club. I like the moist towelettes they give you to clean your hands after the meal. And perhaps the best part? The mini donuts! Our server even brought us some extra and offered to get us waters to go. The donuts were hot and scrumptious. Mmm mm! I think they raised their prices since the last time we came, but it's still a good value. Be prepared to leave full and happy.
BBQ to remember! This was really very good. I had two beef ribs and brisket. The meat was smoked and tender. The BBQ sauce was delicious. The sides were creative and tasty. This is a destination restaurant. I would go out of my way to eat here.
My favorite place. I have never had a bad experience. The Burgers are perfection. That's what I am having today. . . We sat outside and they warned us that there is a problem with flies in the morning but we set out here anyway. It is true but hey it's outside and the weather is great!. . And they were so accommodating when we asked to move. It's just on the morning and not a big deal.
possibly the BEST bbq I've ever had! . First of all the portions are huge! my boyfriend and I thought shared a whole hog heaven would be perfect for us, but we barely finished half of it! their meat is so well cooked, the rib meat falls right off the bone and the brisket melts in your mouth like cotton candy. The mash potato as a side dish is a must too! The complementary cinnamon donut are also a delight, as full as you will be after the meal, you will definitely have stomach for those little donuts! . The staff here are very professional and friendly.Our waitress was very helpful in answering our questions on the menu and checked up on us every so often to make sure we are satisfied with everything. Great restaurant!!
Best place in Phoenix! Came here for lunch and dinnet! Atmosphere nice, service great and food is amazing!
Absolutely hog heaven. I need to be wheeled out of this place. Best BBQ I've ever had!
Happy Hour is fun!  Great food and drink specials!
Place is amazing.
MehBQ. Abysmal service. Would have been a total bust but for the Mac & Cheese side and cornbread. But probably the worst, driest, most overpriced pulled pork sandwich I've had in the Valley. I won't be going back.
Whoa.  Fantastic BBQ.  Out of the numerous places I've been to, Texas and all, Bobby Q wins numero uno at this point.. . It's really hard to find good brisket.  Bobby Q has GREAT brisket...the best I've ever had.  And yes, even better than the places I've been to in Texas.  The BBQ overall was better than what I've had in Texas.  . . We ordered a 3 meat combo platter with ribs, sausage, and brisket.  Our sides included pecan cole slaw and mac n cheese.  The cole slaw wasn't very tasty or flavorful.  The mac n cheese was cheesy, creamy, and yum.  We also ordered a side of veggies to make us feel better about our meal.  Haha.  . . It was busy but we were able to get a table right away.  Service was decent.  Parking gets a little packed but you'll find a space somewhere.  . .  Oh, and at the end of the meal...you get fresh donuts sprinkled in cinnamon sugar FTW!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  (Yes, that's my Hunter Pence chant.)  . . Bobby Q is doing everything right and I'm so glad I got to try it.  Gives me another reason to come back and visit Phoenix!
A must go to place when in town. Best BBQ EVER!. . The service is great and this is a great place for groups. Especially when getting the hog heaven. . . Brisket, sausage, chicken, corn bread.
Solid four-star restaurant but not five. The beef brisket was the most flavorful brisket I've had in my entire life; A penetrating yet not overpowering smoky sensation.  The Carolina sauce was a genuine flavorful masterpiece.  It's commonplace for vegetables in barbecue joints to be lackluster, but a four and one half star 800+ review restaurant should be an exception to the rule: it was not. On the more delectable side, we had the Apple cobbler for dessert -nine out of 10.
I have been to Bobby Q a couple of times now and LOVE this place.. If you have a date that you need to impress and still fill your carnivorous desires, this is the place!  It's all good: ribs, juicy brisket, smoky chicken, can't go wrong here. . . The atmosphere is awesome at Bobby Q's the outside is Caribbean and the inside classy. The only improvement I would like to see would be the lunch menu on the weekends.
Great BBQ, comfortable family atmosphere, service was spot-on and friendly (our waitress was Carmella). I visit mom in Phoenix at least once a year.  This place is going on our list of recommended restaurants to share with friends and family. I had the BBQ Brisket dinner with my 2 sides: the pecan cole slaw and beans. Although I usually tend to prefer hot BBQ sauce, I prefer the Carolina sauce - delish!!
We hit this spot on our way out of Phoenix yesterday.  We had received awesome feedback from our friends.  I am always a little biased when it come to BBQ because I lived in St. Louis, KC and Memphis. . . Let me tell you that this place is outstanding!!  The ribs, beef brisket and Cajun shrimp appetizer were excellent.  . . Better than the food was the wonderful service.  Even the manager stopped by to check on our experience. . . We will stop here on every future trip to Phoenix.
Great BBQ, good burgers, possibly the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten.  GO there NOW!
Every time I come here the service is extraordinary! I love the food, the people, and the atmosphere, it's just a great place to come with family and friends. If your
Great place, fun environment, yummy bbq, delicious margaritas, and the best hot cider mill donuts!!  Phillip was an awesome server and made our visit the best!  We had the best time ever for our last nights stay in Arizona!  Thank you Bobby Q!!
Baby back and St Louis sale ribs are awesome. Love the coleslaws and baked potatoes.  Will sure be back next time we are in town!!!. . Corn bread is also very very good!!!
The best BBQ I have ever had!! My husband is a rib lover and said he has never had ribs like these... not to mention they have great staff!! Chelsea our waitress was great never had to ask for a refill!! Thanks!!
We were visiting from Chicago and walked to this spot because it was close to the hotel. We were very happy to see the great AZ atmosphere and delicious menu! Our food was excellent and our service was even better! Our server Nicole was great and on top of her game! If I am ever back in AZ I will make sure to stop here again!
