Great vibe great staff oh and good music. The bartenders are friendly and service is fast i came here for a mini vacation and enjoyed it and even Visited this great place quite a few times for there oysters and clams . One of the bartenders "Jamie" was great she told me where the best spots in Vegas are And even helped me get access into one of the pool hotspots. This is a great place if your in Vegas and ps. If you eat the peanuts you throw the shells on the floor , that place is known for that just look at the floor :-)
Another good experience at Todd. This place is a little out of the way being tucked back up in the Aria. But it is certainly worth the extra steps for those not staying on-site. Like any good pub, they have a wide selection of beers. Plus lots of variety on their menu. Service this trip was good, but not great. The food continues to be top-notch.
So, you were on the fence for whether you should book a Thursday night dinner at a fancy place.  You already have Friday and Saturday night reservations on the books, and you're planning to splurge on those.  You're not sure you really *need* a third $300 meal for the weekend, and you were apprehensive about having to rush to make it to a Thursday reservation before the restaurant closed-- even if your flight was going to be on time... . . ... of course, your flight was delayed, though a small part of you is now secretly smug about having not booked your reservation.  You're staying at Aria, you're tired, and at this point, you just want some normal food and a beer.  It's not excessively late, but a lot of the restaurants are now closed.  . . Sound familiar?  Before you grumble your way to either room service, a 24 hour restaurant, or whatever quasi food meal substitute you can find within arm's reach, let Todd English P.U.B. be your salvation.  . . Is it the best meal on the strip?  Of course not, it's not even in the discussion.  But, it has decent food, a good beer selection, relatively speaking (i.e. for the Strip) good prices, and it fills a much needed situational void as described above.  . . It's one of my favorite ways to ease into the Vegas debauchery when flying in after work from across the country.  We can usually call ahead from the airport and get in without issue.
Great happy hour for oysters and beer. Otherwise over priced. But its a nice place to meet up on the strip and not spend a ton if you go during happy hour. Also they have the beer challenge, so if you're good at chugging and want to feel really uncomfortable for free beer then this is the spot.
Shady rolled intp T.E PUB Hans Solo style for a lazy Fri afternoon lunch before heading to MGM for 3 nights of slumming with the fishes..had to try the chicken parm sliders, and....um um good!  Nice scene for lunch, great beer selection, personable bartenders, friendly crowd, adjacent to Aria and not far from Cosmo, plenty of tv's to watch the games,outdoor area...whats not to like? Shady , not really a beer type guy, hit the Hank Larsen's early as a prep for the shows that night. Shady makes TE PUB the place to go for a quick at- the- bar type meal.
My husband and I had a late afternoon lunch here after spending the day riding the Ferris Wheel and gambling in Vegas, and it was good, but could have been a bit better for the cost.. . We were staying at the Aria, so it was an obvious lunch choice as something different from the Aria Cafe or the Aria buffet.  We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess, and greeted by a polite server, who oddly, disappeared in the middle of our meal and was replaced with a nice waitress.  It must have been a shift change since were there during the middle of the day, but the swap was never explained to us, which seemed a bit odd.. . The drinks were good.  I had a Moscow Mule while my husband had a craft beer.  Both were served cold and within 5 minutes of being seated.  My husband had a burger while I had a light shrimp cocktail.  My husband really enjoyed his burger, but the fries were the star of the meal.  They were definitely plentiful, and enough to share between the two of us.  So delicious!  The shrimp cocktail was okay, it didn't taste as fresh as others I have had in Vegas, and for the $24 price tag, it definitely was on the very steep end considering the portion size and overall quality.  . . We would consider going here again, but I will definitely try another chilled seafood item from the raw menu - which was pretty impressive for a pub specializing in hearty fare.  Cheers!
Let me begin by saying I'm not a big fan of bloody Mary's, so after a long night of drinking I guess this was the perfect remedy for a hangover, and boy these were damn good! You can customize it to your liking anyway you want it and they have tons of topping options it's crazy mad! I also had the oysters not bad for 2 bucks a piece I would so come back here next time I'm in town
Open, airy, and no pretense ambiance.  Great location in one of the best hotels on the strip. . . Now let's get to business.... . Amazing selection of beers and reasonable prices compared to the rest of the strip restaurants- is what saves this place. . . We sat at the beautiful baker's marble bar. Meticulously clean, shiny bottles surrounding... I would encourage bar or pub seats, as the rest of the restaurant seating is mediocre. . . We had the fried pickles and the gyoza. Random... but we weren't about to pay 20 dollars for a burger- at least not here. Both appys were solid. Nothing amazing- but good fresh ingredients, and hearty portions for sharing.. . The service was decent, but not up to par with 20 dollar burger prices. We heard bartenders complaining openly about split checks (without their split checks you have no check, genius) and overall the bartender staff was not cohesive at all. We felt like the staff spent more attention on their co-workers than their patrons. I understand dealing with the general public can really suck- but be nice... we aren't all dipshits.. . Will we come here again? Absolutely... just not as quickly.
Monster portions that are fantastic is the short story... If you are going to have to single out a day to visit - make it the weekend and get the fully loaded bloody mary that can serve as your entire meal.
We liked it. Not very crowded for a Friday afternoon happy hour. Excellent service and the Apple cider was quite tasty. We did enjoy their wings-they had a nice little kick to them and were huge. The lobster rolls were good but I thought a little over rated. I'll probably give them a chance next visit for their Sunday brunch or maybe a dinner.
When on the Strip, happy hour at the P.U.B. is hard to beat, especially when Jaimee is behind the bar.  With an infectious smile, she serves up half-price pints of delicious brews -- including my personal favorite Ballast Point Sculpin IPA.  And she makes the seven-second challenge (try it with Boddington's) especially fun -- so much fun that I did it two days in a row, winning both times!  Thanks, Jaimee!  Mr English:  Give her a raise!
Food was OK but the service was slow and didn't check how our food was. Also, the first 2 beers they had on their menu that I asked for weren't available.
Delicious food and drinks, but WAY overpriced. I think a Sculpin IPA was $14. Ahhh Vegas....
Ate here twice during a recent visit to LV.  . Great food & great staff.  Super helpful in navigating significant drink and food options.  Typical overpriced LV though. Perhaps 30-40% inflated just because it is inside of ARIA.
Great beer selection.  Good pub food.  Not too many health options but the few things I've tried have been good.
Decided to try this place out after a couple times of walking past it to go to Aria's Casino. It was a Saturday so I some what expected slow service, but it was really slow. Our waiter seemed to forget about us after ordering our fried pickle appetizer when we had told him we just needed a minute to look at the drink menu. The fried pickles we ordered were just average, and we also ordered kobe beef sliders that were okay. Our waiter asked what type of cheese we wanted on the burgers to then see on the bill a $2 charge for the cheese. Not very good customer service to act like it was included and not tell us about the up charge. Prices were above average and the food did not delivery. Probably won't give this place a second try.
Our go to place for consistently good food and a great craft beer selection. My favorite are the Lobster Rolls and you can't go wrong with their oysters or jumbo shrimp off the Raw Bar. The chicken wings are also near the top of the best in town list. Sit at the bar for the best service and active conversation.
Been to Todd English's PUB several times over the past few years. Each time reminded that their version of PUB food is as good as anywhere. Strongly recommend the Pretzel starter. Also recommend any of the meat selections for sandwiches. Pastrami w three mustards and horseradish cream sauce is maybe the best you will see. Service was adequate. We went as a group of 15. Pot Pie is excellent. Recommend the burgers. Last night was great starters. Shrimp cocktail is great value. Huge beer selection. Good atmosphere. Fun.
Great place to drink and watch football. The Aria sports booked fills up fast so we opted to just go here and watch a few games.. . We ended up spending a majority of the day here. Food is good and on the weekends you have to build your own Bloody Mary! . . Really nice people behind the bar and good drinks makes a good time!
4 stars for the happy hour and cool ambiance.. . The $1 wings, $2 oysters, $3 sliders during happy hour brought us here whilest cruising the strip.. . The outside seating is open and airy with modern decor and a view of the classy Aria to supplement your experience.  Indoors, the vibe is more cool and hipster, with massive (yes, much larger than normal) dart boards to entertain.  Choose your poison; they're both great!. . All the happy hour food was delicious and paired well with the huge selection of craft and domestic beers.  Keep the men facing away from the TV screens, as their eyes will be glued there otherwise...It is a pub, I suppose.. . +1 Free Bud Light with Yelp check-in!
Food was good pub food. Service was mediocre. The beer is way over-priced. Good selection but $14 for a pint of US brewed IPA is much higher than even NYC or SF.
Price has gone up-up-up... And a lack of kids menus or pricing makes this a non-kid-friendly place. The food is ok... Some gotchas on the menu make a thorough Q&A with your server required.  All in all I'm unimpressed. It's a really great beer selection, but unless you're there during happy hour, every beer is $15 for a basic pint. Fine if you just hit a jackpot, but it's definitely geared to catch the tourist's dollars. Not locals-friendly at all.  Also, being forced to tip the bathroom attendant sucked.  Can't say I'll be going back.
