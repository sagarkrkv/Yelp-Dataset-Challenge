I love staying in this hotel they really make u feel like u moved in for good the suites r so nice I love them
My room was dirty had bed bugs that bit my Johnson first night. Next morning I noticed my sheets looked like it hadn't been washed. Room was shitty to.
OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed.... . Review #17:. this place is huge!; the story about getting lost in the casino rings true here; I actually got locked out of the place during my exploring, but luckily an employee rescued me and let me into the adjacent convention center (which is quite grand as well); there is a walkway to the 3 Signature Towers of high-end condos; the outdoor/pool areas are extensive & top notch; love the massive hotel lobby with the classic MGM lion sculpture; many scenic high end eateries, including 2 Joel Robuchon restaurants; the West End bar is kind of dark & sexy and tucked away, but not always open; armies of hotties headed to Hakkasan nightclub - wowza!; best craft beer bet = Michael Mina's Pub 1842 for sure, but you will pay to play!; Tap Sports Bar also has a few, but prices aren't much better there
Turned 21 here this summer and had such a blast. Great rooms, very clean, loved the bathroom mirror lights and of course the view. Over all I would definitely visit again. My only complaint would be the $200 up front for the room, I just wish I would've been prepared and that they would have told us over the phone about the charge when we booked the trip, only because we had three rooms so it was $600.
We had a King signature suite room on the west wing, and boy did me and my boy friend LOVE this place! It's so spacious with a huge bed and great bathroom with a tone of mirrors everywhere. Our view wasn't too great but the staff was excellent! Not only to mention my boy friend and I even won money from their casino! Way better than some of the other hotels I've been to in vegas!
Just got back tonight after staying a few nights in a Grand Tower double queen room with my husband and 7 year old son.. . 5-star rating for the AMAZING Yvonne in Housekeeping. As we were putting my son to bed tonight we discovered he had left his stuffed monkey, the one he's had since he was a newborn, back in our hotel room. He was devastated. We made a quick call to the MGM Grand and were transferred to Housekeeping where the wonderful Yvonne located the monkey and is mailing it to us. She was so sweet to our son when he got on the phone and tearily told her thank you for finding his monkey.. . 4-star rating for the hotel itself. Yes, it is humongous. But I found the signage and layout easy to follow. Parking was super easy and accesible off of Koval.  I liked the hotel's location toward the end of the strip because I felt like traffic congestion was minimal. Restaurant options were plentiful. Room was clean and we had lots of towels, toiletries, etc. Noise level in the room was very low but I could still the next door shower going. Suprised there was no minifridge (other than the one stocked with overpriced snacks and drinks) or coffeemaker.. . 2-star rating for David Copperfield's magic show. Some very cool tricks but there was ZERO enthusiasm on his part. He mumbled a lot of his dialogue. Completely phoned-in performance. Bummed that we spent nearly $300 (even with a 20% discount!) on this. The space alien part of the show was downright boring.. . Bottom line is we will definitely be back. Looking forward to seeing Cirque du Soleil's Ka next time!
When I think of big fights, whether UFC or boxing, I think MGM Grand. For gambling, their tables are decent ($25 minimum at just about everything after 10pm), but why is there no kiosk to check your comps anywhere in the building? I had to ask like 3 people where the machine was (standard in every other casino and there's one seemingly around every corner), and found out at the end that I had to pick up a courtesy phone to speak to a customer service rep who gave me my comp total over the phone...seems terribly antiquated for a supposedly high-end casino. Otherwise, it's fine to get your gambling on (and the craps table, call it beginner's luck, was very good to me, so MGM will always have a soft place in my heart).
I am making this review purely because this place has made my travel in Vegas a living hell. Do not stay here. If you feel like passing through this place avoid it like the plague. From the entrance it took me a good 30 mins to get to the monorail. The craziest part is I knew exactly where I was going and moving as fast as I possibly could. There are so many twist and turns. The place is humongous. When you think you are close to where you want to be you realize quickly that you aren't. Its a maze. They have signs to point you to where you want to go but then signs for that destination will disappear and you get lost super easily.  Take for instance the monorail. I will follow the signs for it and they would disappear and I knew well that I was no where near it. I had to ask people to get to where I needed to go. If any of you have ever played Zelda Ocarina of Time, this place would be the Water Temple X10. . . AVOID AVOID AVOID . . You have been warned
The "City Views" are quality 4-star rooms that come at a great value if you can book before before they announce the concert or event at the adjacent arena. Otherwise, good luck, or try elsewhere. The room is modern, clean, has many towels, great water pressure, and decent amenities. There is no fridge and if you try and place your stuff in the mini-bar fridge, it's a whopping $50 fee.. There's a sketchy $25 resort fee that is charged daily, regardless of if the pool is open or not or if it is cold/rainy outside. It does include wi-fi.. It's a shit-show trying to check in the Friday morning of an event weekend; talk about 1 to 2 hour lines to check in. Oy vey. And then there's the elevators. I have faith these lifts are freight certified because there are far few too elevators for the 2nd largest hotel on Earth. As a result, the elevators are packed-- nah, packed is a too nice a word-- Tokyo rush hour subway crammed-- yeah that's more like it-- during peak hours before/after an event.. There are lots of dining ops around where you can drop lots of money on food that can be hit or miss. Good luck. Great craps table. Love the dealers.. I'd stay here again.
The MGM Grand opened in 1993, roughly the same era as the Mirage, Excalibur, Rio, Luxor, Treasure Island, Hard Rock, Stratosphere, and Monte Carlo.  . . When you compare it (or any on that list) against the newer hotels, it's just not going to hold up.  The new hotels all learned from the previous ones as time went along, so of course the Bellagio, Venetian, Aria, Wynn, etc. are better than the MGM Grand.  It's easy to improve upon things once you've seen them play out elsewhere.  For that reason, it's admittedly a little unfair to downgrade the MGM Grand for opening near the beginning of The Strip's modernization.. . With that said though, as you're deciding where to stay, the comparison has to be current day against current day, and the MGM Grand is one of my least favorite hotels on The Strip.  The walls in the rooms seemed paper thin, the room itself felt dark and uninviting, and the resort itself is just so massive and lacking a flow pattern that it feels stale.  As the epicenter of The Strip keeps being pulled north, I feel like it's going out of the way to head that far south.  The draw just isn't there for me.
My gf and I booked for 3 nights here at the MGM Grand last weekend and I must say it was a pleasant experience. The bed was very comfortable and pillow's were very soft. We both slept very well. The view of the room was alright didn't have much of a view except of the New York hotel. Room service are on top of there game they come in everyday to clean up our room. They did a great job! . . Although, the casino area is like a chimney LOL might need a stronger vent to suck all that smoke out. Other then that, we both had a great time in Vegas. I would recommend this hotel.
Great hotel!  The staff is very professional and friendly.  The room was very clean and had a new feel to it.  The casino is great because it is not too busy and they have newer machines.  The location could be better but still pretty close to the center of the strip.
This is by far the best hotel in vegas for me. I love their new rooms and restaurants. When I first went to vegas I stayed here and now I always stay here. I once stayed at Excalibur, because my friends could not afford mgm. I should've just stayed here and let them stay at Excalibur.
Jonathan and the front desk very calmly and pleasantly ensured me that my concerns would quickly be addressed.  Soon the front desk manager, Trevor Rogina came out and showed me the error I thought MGM had made was in fact mine. I was impressed how professional and nice these guys were and still made some adjustments to show good faith when in fact they did not have to do anything. Am I going back to MGM again? Absolutely, I already booked with Trevor to take my wife to Andrea Bocelli's concert. MGM staff rocks!!!!
Hotel is clean and the rooms were a good size. Went to the Wolfgang restaurant , pizza was good and then to hakkasan Friday night which was great. One down side of hotel was I ordered sparkling wine for friends who just got engaged . The hotel charged almost 60$ for a 9$ cheap bottle of cava. Disappointing trick for a hotel that as nice as it is.
I've stayed at the MGM Grand 3 years running in January for the Consumer Electronics Show. I've been pleased with each visit . . The biggest complaint I've ever run into is that the length of the hallways is ridiculous. That may not sound like a big deal, but it can be given the size of the overall property. The property size is a plus in my book because it makes the place all inclusive in a lot of ways. If you're up early or late at night, there's always something open for you to eat or drink. . . The rooms have always been in great shape during my visits. Room service has always been timely and I've never experienced any issues with the staff. One thing I like about the room is the black out curtains. They come in very handy if you're working or partying on a weird schedule.. . We'll be staying there again in early January and I assume the experience will be the same I've had in the past 3 years.
Nice Place
The MGM is a solid choice when in Vegas, the hotel is massive with multiple wings and towers which can be quite confusing when consuming certain beverages but that do offer many choices for dining & shopping. . . Many of the rooms have been recently renovated and they are great, we opted for the King Suite which was well worth the cost being the size of most studio apartments equipped with living room, desk/work area, king size bed, excellent views and an amazing bathroom with 2 showers (which you never think you need until you are running late and both people need to shower at the same time...which then the 2 showers becomes ahhmazing).. . Staff here was friendly and really helpful when there was a snafu on our final bill. . . The only thing that I didn't like is that the gym guests can use for free is just a cardio room with absolutely no weights or other machines. The cardio equipment is old and not well maintained - many of the tvs didn't work, sound didnt' work or the equipment wouldn't move without making god awful noises. BUT if you pay $10 (per visit) you can use the nice gym where everything is extremely well maintained. In fact two days while we were working out there a staff member was going around machine by machine to test them...a suggestion MGM...maybe have that staff member visit your cardio room as well. . . I know it's not a big deal to most people in Vegas, but it is for me, and I really don't like having to pay $10 on top of all the other fees to workout in a nice space. I think that's how most people feel as well because there was never another person in that fitness center which is a shame because it's one of the best I have seen at a resort.
We stayed in the lofts. Gross. Everything felt sticky, dirty. The room was so dark one could not put on make up. No bright lighting. The glass toilet door left little to the imagination, no privacy. The door didnt even close right. The glass shower leaked into the toilet room. No coffee maker, no amenities. Bed was comfy so were the pillows. I would never stay here again. I had better rooms at days inn. As far as the pool, the lazy pool was fun but 30 bucks for 2 tubes is ridiculous.
They haven't updated their ventilation system/renovated and almost passed out due to the amount of smoke in the casino. Think LA smog indoors. Negative 3 stars.
The MGM is a great choice when visiting Vegas.. . Room was great, I was on the 11th floor of the Grand Tower, room was spacious with all new furniture and other amenities. I'll admit the view wasn't much to look at but I had a grand time playing with the automatic blinds.  The king sized bed was huge and ridiculously comfortable, it felt like I suck right in.  Bathroom is also very modern and unlike most hotels, the shower heads are high letting water fall down on you instead of hitting you in the neck like some places.. . Casino is good, they allow smoking but most places do in Vegas so you just have to roll with the punches. I will say my one complaint with the casino floor is it would be nice if they had more than 4 or 5 crap tables. As somebody who likes to throw the bones, I would like a few more options.. . I love the sports book, I spent an entire NFL Sunday kicking back and enjoying all the games displayed over the many monitors.. . Food options are plentiful and for the most part of good quality.. . Staff is good, took forever to get checked in because of an issue with the website I booked through but staff was patient through the process and gave me a decent food credit for the hassle.. . Great hotel, right at the tail end of the strip but easily in walking distance to all the main attractions, will definitely make the MGM part of my next Vegas trip.
My bf and I stayed here back in July of this year for the first time. I really liked this hotel and casino. We stayed in the west tower in one of the basic rooms. It was a pretty tiny room, but the room was clean and nice despite it's small size, so I was fine with it. The bathroom was really compact and was there to greet you as soon as you walked in the room. My only real complaint would be that there was no real counter space whatsoever just primarily a sink and storage underneath, so not a whole lot of space for us ladies to lay out our makeup and stuff lol, but that didn't bother me too much. Also the remote for the TV wasn't working consistently, but we weren't planning to just sit inside and watch TV all day anyways, so it wasn't too much of a bother.  . . Free wi-fi, but it didn't work very well to be honest. And I think it was only free for one device. . . The lobby was huge and really nice actually. Check in was pretty quick. We arrived early, maybe around 12, so our room wasn't ready yet, but the friendly lady at the desk let us check into another room early and waived the early check in fee, which we much appreciated! Our room also came with a free buffet, so that was a nice bonus. . . The casino and hotel itself was huge! it felt like forever until we made it to the pool from our room lol. So if you stay in the west tower be prepared for a journey if you plan to go to the pool. But the long walk was worth it. The pool area itself was pretty big. I think there was maybe 4 pools and a lazy river. The lazy river was nice, but if you don't like being around kids then be prepared or stay away lol. The other pools were pretty quiet and peaceful though. . . Overall I really enjoyed the MGM grand! I'd likely stay here again.
The biggest hotel on the strip!. . It's a grand hotel with lots of great restaurants, shows, shops, concerts & comfortable rooms. It's located near the airport which is convenient for many visitors. . . The negative is for anyone who is parking here, it's a long walk! Always valet! If valet is full which happens on the weekends & with concerts you won't have an option and have to walk far. . . The positive aspects are that there's a lot to do at this hotel & it's a great spot for dozens of great restaurants!
I stayed here during the Thanksgiving season. One thing that annoyed me is that they don't have a bar specifically for you to hang your clothes on when you shower. In addition, the label on the mini-fridge was confusing. The label said that if the contents are altered or something is placed in it, there will be a $50 restocking fee charged. I'm a little confused on how charging someone if they put something in the fridge works, since you could put something in the fridge and take it out before you leave.. . Other than that, everything else seemed good. The room was clean, and the window had shades controlled by some buttons on the wall. There was a TV with a lot of channels with some MGM-related information, and I liked the AC/heater control. It was neat that there was a little mirror on the side of the bathroom whose position is adjustable; I found it very useful when I was putting contacts in my eyes. I also liked that they had power outlets on desks. In addition, a safe is in one of the drawers, which I put my valuables in whenever I left the room. Towels, a hair dryer, an iron, soap, and travel-sized lotion, shampoo, body wash, and conditioner were provided.. . Self-parking was good in that there was a moderate amount of parking spaces available. There are a lot of restaurants near the parking structure, including a Haagen Dazs shop. The more expensive restaurants are in the hotel itself. The fountain by the elevators is beautiful. At night, there's a security guard by the elevators who may ask to see your room key, which makes me feel more secure.
MGM is ok I guess and navigating throughout the casino could have been thought out a lot better. In my opinion placing the floor map of the casino could have been in a better location such as when you first come in after parking your car, you have to find the map buried within the casino. Also they have a horrible potpourri smell in the lobby area and beyond. I'd advise if you have breathing issues or not really a custom to a very heavy fragrant to plant type materials I would try and avoid this area as much as you can, especially kids with breathing health issues.
