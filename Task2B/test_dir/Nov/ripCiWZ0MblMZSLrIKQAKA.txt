Mediocre at best; reasonable rate, but a bit tired and worn. Room was fair, but the premium for a "high floor" room was a waste. Look around, you can likely find better deals.
Realllly bad ... Bad service , bad room, no wifi in room.... I will not come here anymore.  Horrible hotel ........
Ok, so I've been there a few times but never stayed....this review is for the Hit Bar & Lounge located in the Monte Carlo.  Let's just say it's one of the best real drink bars in all of Las Vegas.. . When you walk in from the strip, the Hit Bar is just past the steakhouse on the right.. . The best thing about this bar is that it is NOT focused on tourism or video poker or anything other than drinks.  They take classic drinks from around the most popular hotel bars in the USA and replicate them!  They present all of them in a cool faux leather bound menu...and fix very traditional and proper concoctions.. . The bartenders are real, no sloppy drinks here.  If you want a Bud Light or a shot or a crappy drink, just go somewhere else.  If you're looking to get your money's worth for a superior blended beverage, then indulge and enjoy.  One of the best "secret" finds on the strip!!. . If you like real drinks, stop here...you will not be disappointed.
Rooms were very old they need to update it the casino and hotel itself was not bad.
I'm only giving this two stars because of the the gentleman that checked us in, he was extremely nice and helpful, I wish I could remember his name but I don't. . . Regardless, this hotel sucks ass. Everything about it sucks ass. It is old, the beds are stiff and suck, the rooms look filthy because they are so old. The ac claims its at a temperature (for example 60) and it's not even remotely close to 60. The bathroom is still from the 80s, the shower head seems like they bought it at the dollar tree. The casino sucks. The drinks are expensive. The only reason we stayed here is because we waited too long to book for SEMA, and we immediately regretted it. If you want an enjoyable hotel experience don't stay here.
This is a sad sad casino. It has definitely seen better days. When compared to the shiny new hotels on the strip -- Monte Carlo pales in comparison. The carpet is a little worn down and the smell of cigarette smoke lingers in the air. . . I only played table games here, so I can't comment on the hotel. But, the waitresses were very friendly and brought our drinks often. The dealers had a lot of character and made the games fun.. . It probably wouldn't be my first choice for gaming, but it's not a terrible choice if you seem to be striking out in other places. (;
Really mixed emotions on Monte Carlo.. We stayed here four nights at the end of October. . It is your AVERAGE hotel - nothing fancy, nothing special.. . What really drove me crazy was:. $20 per day "resort" fee that was for bottle water and WIRED internet access.. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??  If you have the balls to charge me $20 mandatory a day internet charge, at least make it wireless.  I have 2 iapds and an iphone and I cant get onto the internet? WHAT A JOKE! . . The pool was decent - Small wave pool, lazy river, and a regular pool.
Its never easy to give a place like the monte carlo such a low rating. I stayed here more then 10 years ago when it was in much better condition and had a better overall feel. I stayed here for a company group trip. The group reservation department handled everything great and gave us a good deal on the rooms. The main reason for this hotel given such low ratings is that it feels like everything is old and not maintained that well. upon arriving to my room, the AC did not work. they sent someone up right away to fix it. The maintenance guy fixed it and also put in a air filter since apparently it was missing, The room while overall clean, you could tell the wear in the carpet, chipped furniture, peeling paint in the ceiling. the sofa had unidentified white marks on it, which required a call to housekeeping for some white flat sheets to cover it to sit on. The bed while clean was sagging on both side which kept me sleeping dead center even if i didnt want to the one thing positive about this hotel was almost all the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room i had was a monaco suite. So in conclusion for the right price its not overall bad, just dont expect high luxury.
We were in Vegas for the Marine Corps Ball but we didn't have a room for the prior night so we thought we'd stay in Monte Carlo since we were already there. It was very cheap, $70/night, not bad at all. But you get what you paid for, it was just a room, nothing fancy, holiday inn quality. But on the plus side, it was very clean!
Nice hotel with lots of amenities... But in this day and age what hotel doesn't have wifi in their rooms?!!
Pleasantly surprised with the quality of rooms and service that the Monte Carlo provided on my stay! I usually aim to stay at the properties that are newer because the older ones generally just have a "dated" kind of feel to them! Well I'm hear to say that wasn't the case by any means! I had a very easy check in! I booked my reservation through the MLife customer service and check in wEnt smoothly! The front desk representative was very pleasant! I booked a high floor room with one kind bed but received 2 queens.. Not really sure why I didn't get the exact requested I put in being that having two beds wasn't necessary at all but hey having two beds are better than none! The rooms was pretty nice and the beds were extremely comfortable! You literally fall asleep right away! The bathroom amenities were just a bit underwhelming but did the job! Having a view of the city center at night was very nice as well! Overall I would definitely stay again!
Three stars in many places, but as Vegas hotels go only one star. Very disappointed with the Monte Carlo itself as a facility. The people are nice but they charge one of the highest resort fees on the strip and the rooms do not have Wi-Fi (they advertise high speed Internet, but it is only a lan line-the kind that would work on the lap top I replaced a few years ago. Wi-Fi is only available on the ground and second floors). . . We paid a premium price for a strip view, but due to newer hotels blocking the view, our strip view represented about 100 actual yards of the strip. . . One of the days we came back to our room after 10:00 at night, and housekeeping had not gotten to us yet. . . The carpets all look like they should've been replaced five years ago. It is just run down, and while I have only speculation based on observation to go by, my guess is that MGM (the owner) is going to bulldoze the place for new facility within the next 18 months.
Lazy river and pool was shut, apparently they claimed it was noted on the website but we couldn't find it. . . The casino area and restaurants were reasonably nice and the room was spacious. The walls were paper thin you could literally hear everything, and the pipe work was so loud someone had a shower at 4am and woke us up. . . Don't normally like to complain but the overall experience was poor and after discussing with management they weren't to concerned in making it any better for us. I would not consider staying there ever again.
My boyfriend and I stayed here two weeks ago for our first Vegas trip together/sports tournament trip. I originally booked the deluxe room but noticed a few days later the Spa Suite was available for an extra hundred dollars a night so i decided to upgrade. Check in was long but it was a Saturday and there were around six employees checking in guests. The hotel lobby was very nice and didn't feel outdated at all. I admit it was not as modern as places like Aria but it was not themed to be so I didn't feel it detracted from the hotel at all. The Spa Suite was very nice. It was clean and spacious we enjoyed the glass shower and large sink area. The bar area was nice and clean. Our room overlooked the strip and the large window with the spa was very nice. Best was very comfortable and we slept great. We would definitely stay here again.
For our 9 year anniversary we decided to do a weekend getaway to Las Vegas.  Our last visit to Sin City was over 8 years ago and we knew a lot had changed since then.  If we were to head to Vegas we knew we wanted to do it right and have the steak dinner, the shows and the entire Vegas package.  Our last visit we stayed at the Venetian (which I loved) and although super nice it came with a price and we were unable to afford the amenities of the shows and everything else that Vegas has to offer.  After scouring the web and reading a ton of reviews we settled on the Monte Carlo for this trip.. . The Monte Carlo is an older hotel but still carries itself with great luxury.  The hotel is still modern in its design and really does feel as upscale as many of the newer places in my opinion.  They have a number of restaurants on the premises and although most reviews I read said to stay away we found a great steakhouse and coffee shop that were fantastic.  Upon check-in we found that the room choice we had made were limited in availability and thus we ended up on the 7th floor which really hindered the view of the strip.  I was fine with this as we really weren't planning on spending much time in the room themselves although higher is definitely the way to go.  The room was spacious and nicely furnished, the water pressure was great in the shower (the tub unfortunately had a slow drain that wouldn't keep the water).  The one downfall to the room is the fact that the Monte Carlo only currently offers a wired internet connection in the rooms (our didn't work) and WiFi is only in the 1st two floors (casino and spa/pool areas).  It was unfortunately colder and quite windy during our visit so the Pool was never even an option on this visit.. . Despite having a long line at check-in, the process was smooth and seamless and we got through it in just a few minutes.  The express checkout is nice and can be done in numerous way as well including through the TV, the kiosks downstairs, via text message, calling a automated number on your room phone or filling out a card and leaving it at the desk downstairs.  . . The Monte Carlos also houses a number of stores throughout as well as being the current home of The Blue Man Group show.  The also house the Minus 5 Bar, Ignite Bar and upscale eateries such as Andre's and Brand Steakhouse.  They offer Valet parking in front or self parking in a structure to the rear between Frank Sinatra and Las Vegas Blvd (although it was a bit hard to find unless you know where it is.. . For what we got and the time we spent here, I feel that the Monte Carlo was a great value and a definite good stay.  The casino I found a bit lacking overall compared to some of the other nearby hotels but being as I am not a big gambler this was not much of an issue.  I would definitely stay here again for future visits.
Beware of the flyer that the cleaning staff leave in your room called Pizza Bella - don't order from them - expensive and tasteless food.  No one ever offered a complementary drink in casino - like they do in other hotels. Average rooms. No wifi!!!
The rooms are clean they don't charge for water bottles inside of our room. They would get a lil bit better review if the quality attention to detail was there. The buffet in the resort was okay I was very glad they had a to go box. This works great in a very time crunch
I have stayed twice at Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, I had to give it a second chance plus try a jacuzzi room. Well, the "jacuzzi" room now is just a big bath tub sitting near the window, they removed the water jet tubs :-( The Monte Carlo marketing pictures and info show jets, for that reason, I had to mark them down.. . The location of the Las Vegas Monte Carlo is great since I like walking the strip to go through as many casinos as my feet will let me. I ate at the food court for breakfast because a number of the food chains actually have a breakfast menu; it was quick, good and reasonably priced.. . The pools are nice and a lazy river and wave pool are cool, but there is a lack of seating so theyare hard to enjoy without planning. I went to the pool on a Monday in fall and was barely able to find a place to lay down for some Sun.. . My previous stay in Vegas was in a basic room and I got what I expected: basics, so I would stay at the Monte Carlo Las Vegas again if I had to, but they won't be my first choice.
This hotel is 4 Diamond rated by Forbes. It is home to the Blue Man Group show and has about 15 different eateries ranging from fast food to fine dining. . . Fast food: McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway, Original Chicken Tender, Sambalatte, and More. . Restaurants: Brand Steakhouse, Andre's French Restaurant, The Pub, Yusho Japanese Group, 800 Degrees Pizzeria, Diablo's Cantina, and Double Barrel.. . Other great places are like Minus 5, it's a room made of ice where you can purchase enter and receive fur coats to keep warm, inside is a full bar where they serve your drinks in a frozen cup.. . There's a team that will take you to Crystals shipping center and the Bellagio hotel.. . The hotel has direct inside access to the Aria hotel, that way u don't have to go outside.
My last 2 years of visits to Las Vegas this has been my go-to place to stay for the price, the life style and the crowd. . You get a good mix here of younger people, families and older people as well - the casino floor is easy to navigate - not too large but not too small . . I always seem to win here - so one of the main reason why I like to stay here . . The pool is great durning summer time - and these guys throw a great pool party on the weekend during the summer season . . I usually stay in a pretty basic room - I'm in vegas for the fun not for the room so it works out well being center strip. Parking here is usually pretty easy to figure out as well with the multi-tierd parking garage in the back of the hotel. The food court is open at all hours as well - which is a big plus if you are out all night and want something to eat at 3am before bed . . This really is the place to stay with its location, pricing, and all around offerings -- one thing to note BECOME AND "M LIFE" MEMBER  and get one of the players club cards that work at multiple casinos in the area, take advantage of the room deals and other offerings.
Overall, very impressive especially for the price that I paid for the room.  Very quick and prompt checkin.  The strip view was worth the few extra bucks.  The room was very clean and comfy.  Well laid out shops and casino.  The buffet was not as impressive, though. I felt for the price, I was expecting much more.
The AAA listing claims that the Monte Carlo has wireless internet. However, this is absolutely not the case. (apparently they only have it in two rooms... And they're 'suites'.) I am a junior in college, taking online classes... With deadlines. Internet is a must for me. I found out that my initial hotel room didn't have it and (after a VERY rude encounter with a front desk woman) was told they would have a new room for me by 12:00 today WITH wireless internet. After going through 3 different concierge people, they finally found a different room for me by 6:30pm.... It was filthy and STILL no internet. Moved to a THIRD room. This one with a shitty view of the roof and heating ducts, and Lo and behold.... STILL no working internet.... What exactly are we paying this $20 "resort fee" for, again?
This is not a bad place. The rooms are ok. I've never had a problem with the staff. Always a great rate.. . Love how there's a Starbucks and subway among other places. You don't always want to sit at a swanky restaurant. Great coffee in the morning...that i loved. . . If you want beauty and luxury, this is not the place for you. If you want a good rate and a nice/descent place to stay..this is it.
Visited Vegas for 2 nights with some old friends in mid-November.  Monte Carlo met our expectations.  It is a good hotel, in a good location with a good casino, good restaurants and good service and offers good rooms for a good price.  Nothing was bad.  Nothing was outstanding.  We did not use the pool area, but it is small, which would be a drawback in the summer.  Overall, Monte Carlo is a good base for a buddies Vegas trip.
I do NOT understand how a 4 star hotel in Las Vegas does not provide wifi internet in rooms.  Cheap motels in third world countries provide in room wifi and usually the price is included in the room fee.   Here they charge you 20 dollar per day for wired internet and it's  MANDATORY god knows why.  . . When we first got here the line up for checking in was so long that I took a nap and still find it being endless.. Finally got that done and after agreeing to pay your 20 dollar room charge; you would be disappointed for thinking Ok no wifi and they charge that much the room must be nice or something must be good. . Wrong!.  The room looked like they were renovated in the 80s. I would say its spacious but walls are paper thin being able to hear every convo next door makes. Theres an old air con/fan that made screeching noises every 2 minutes so it was useless.  The blankets are paper thin too and I caught a cold during my third nights stay.  The bathtub is so shallow and short that I gave up trying to take a bath in there. (I'm only 5'9") TV has very limited channels compare to what they play on the big screens in their casino.. .  I confronted the staff that I had wifi signal in the room the first night of my stay.  But no more after the first night.  She told me I was "being very lucky" because only the lobby and second floor have the signal. . . I didn't even wanna argue with her at that point.  It is sad that a 4 star hotel management team told me I was lucky to be able to use a service I paid for everyday. It was clear that they were constructing part of the hotel and maybe rebuilding the wifi. Well people don't charge your guest if the service is not ready.... . . Overall I had to say this place ruined my first time Vegas experience.  There's plenty of places to go that will provide you free wifi and nicer rooms.. . Oh yeah gotta add this.  now I'm waiting in line again for over 20 minutes to check out..   . My room charge should be 385 dollars and I just discovered that they have charged me twice 385 on my credit card.  Also my friends room charge should be 115 and he was charged 165 dollars.  Complete bs
We are still guests here butI had to post a review. The only thing I like about the room is the bed. It seems like a motel room. I don't understand why there is no wifi. I think every hotel should offer wifi, even if it is at a charge. I have to go out of the hotel to Aria to conduct business via my phone. I can't even get the free wifi to work on the first 2 floors like advertised. The hotel itself needs major renovating. It is so dated and the smell is not pleasant. I will say that when checking in, the front desk was helpful. However, we were in a group with 3 different rooms and we asked to be on the same floor which was accommodated. However, upon entering one of the rooms, it was not cleaned yet and so our other guests in our party had to be moved 25 floors up from us. We will not stay here again and would rather stay at the newly updated New York New York or splurge and stay at Aria or Cosmopolitan.
I chose to stay at the Monte Carlo because we had a Seminar that was taking place there. First let me say,I do not understand how this place even rated as a supposed 4 star hotel in Las Vegas.. . When we first got here the line up for checking in was so long that I was embarrassed with my staff. Okay now off to the room. Maybe we can start over. Wrong!.  The room looked like they were renovated in the 80s. I would say its spacious There was an old air con/fan that made terrible noises every 2 minutes so it was useless.  The blankets are paper thin too and I caught a cold during my third nights stay.  The bathtub is so shallow and old and nasty. I didn't even want to complain because I figured they would only move to a different room with the same amenities. I would have rather stayed in a Comfort suites than this place. We were only there for 2 nights so I did not spend much time in my room. The restaurants that were in the hotel and next to it outside were overall good but nothing spectacular. I will definitely not stay here again. I will stay at The Mandalay but I wonder how does this place stay in the M Life group of Hotels.. Needless to say I am ready to get out of there on Sunday AM and I'm waiting in line again for over 20 minutes to check out. Sorry Avoid this place!!!
