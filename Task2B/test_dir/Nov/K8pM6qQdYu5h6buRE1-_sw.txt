I'm a Yankee that's so Yankee he roots for his hometown Yankees.  So take this for what it's worth.. . This place has the best fried chicken that I've ever had.  The prices are what they should be.  The waffles are good, and they'll make them crispy if you ask.. . I've been in here 5-10 times and they've never gotten anything wrong.  Solid 5 stars.. . Also I'm glad they stopped doing the valet.  Valet creeps me out.  I can park a car.  I've done it before.
Oh Dear Lord I know gluttony is a sin but this food was the bomb diggity. Mrs. White did a awesome job teaching her son to cook soul food. Everything was just like I remember when eating at Mrs. White's and I was not disappointed.  The kool-aid drinks were delicious and refreshing. Steven our server was amazing, kind and energetic.  I know I will be back to try other things off the menu and I can't wait.
My favorite place to eat when I come to phoenix. Banana pudding is to die for. Order the pecan waffles with your chicken. The gravy is out of this world. All the sides are fantastic!  This is mama's good ole home cooking comfort food.
LOVE THIS location!!! I came on a Friday afternoon and bought a desk correct away seeing that it wasn't very busy. The carrier was quick and everybody was tremendous friendly. I obtained the Lil Amadi with fries, and lemonade. Fowl was crispy and the WAFFLE was amazingly tasty. The menu made me snort. Contemplated on coming again.. . Very good southern fried hen and waffles.  Wait staff was robust and the sweet tea is out of this world good. The waffles remind me of Waffle apartment waffles, and that's a just right thing!  . . I had the bird tenders and also you could inform they have been breaded in the kitchen and no pre-frozen. My spouse had the bird and waffles and he or she particularly loved it!  . . Total, I particularly endorse this situation!
The hostess here is terrible. Still waiting for a solid hour for a table. We were told our name was called (not true as we were sitting on the couch near the door where the surly hostess emerges). When we inquired why we were being passed up for a table we were then graciously added to the bottom of the list. People were literally waiting 5 minutes for a table. Unbelievable.
I so love this place I can't come to Phoenix without hitting up Lo Lo's Chicken & Waffle!! The good is awesome how can you go wrong eating chicken with waffles you can't!! Everything on their menu is delicious from the shrimp & grits the traditional kool-aide served in mason jars you come once & you'll be hooked!!!. The chicken is always deliciously fried never too greasy now the Kool-Aid can be a little bit sweet but I always have them add a little sierra mist to it that kind of dilutes it a little, . Now for the cornbread it's all warm fluffy & buttery what more could one ask for.. If you've never had shrimp and grits this is definitely the place to try it! Plump juicy seven jumbo shrimp spread over buttery creamy grits with bacon cheese,  Green onion I believe they also have a little bit of Tabasco or some type of seasoning that gives it a nice little kick! . One of the best homegrown family restaurants I've ever eaten at from the small little house to three locations downtown on Central in Scottsdale and also located in the Phoenix airport anytime you visit Arizona especially Phoenix make sure you plan on making it a stop that you can't pass by go in and indulge in all of the deliciousness
I was really excited to try some fantastic soul food and the menu didn't disappoint  but almost everything else did. . . The wait time to get into the restaurant was reasonable and they do offer a nice outside lounge to wait at but it went downhill from there. . . Our table of five was placed in the COOP room. The acoustics of that room made it incredibly loud. The surfaces are all hard, the sound of the metal chairs scratching against the concrete reminds one of nails on chalkboard, but that's ok. It's part of the vibe. The AC was icy though, perhaps because we were under the vent. Our server was quick and pleasant and the drinks arrived promptly.. . We mainly ordered some variation of fried chicken and associated sides with one of our party ordering the shrimp and grits.  Forty-five minutes later (the magic of texting and time stamps) the food came. There was no unprompted check in to explain why the wait was so long. When the food arrived we were told it was the shrimp and grits, almost like it was our fault for ordering it. . . The taste of the food was OK. The shrimp and grits were hot but it seemed that the chicken had sat waiting for the last of the order to be completed. The waffle was warm and the corn muffins outstanding. The rice in the dirty rice was not fully cooked and the mac and cheese had congealed during the wait. . . I'm sure our experience would have been better had the food been hot and arrived more promptly or at least with some apology. It's always better to tell the truth and say we're sorry we forgot to make an item on your ticket than to claim something like shrimp and grits takes 45 minutes to prepare.
I love the atmosphere lovevthe food, portion was great and very crowded,  little too small for the amount of people and the wait is crazy but so worth it, recommended to anyone that want a piece of history.
I have been to this location several times. Love everything I have ever eaten here. They have recently revamped the breakfast menu and I like the new choices. Only thing I don't like is the mandatory valet parking, not the Ritz Carlton people!
This was the first time coming back to this location in years! I love the comfort food here and can't get enough of it! They have remodeled and looks even better. The big pain about this location last time was the parking, but it got better becausethere is a lot of self parking spots and they even have a complimentary valet service! . . I chose to valet the car of course. Too lazy to walk, lol. It was steady and busy for a Sunday. The wait was about 30 minutes. Walking in though it was like a whole new atmosphere. The place was bigger than last time I seen it, so there was ample room. We got seated in the booth. I forgot who was our waiter, shame on me, but they were very pleasant and nice. We all ordered the smothered chicken and man it was DELICIOUS. It definitely hit the spot. The chicken even though it was smothered with the creamy gravy and onions still had a little crunch to it which was good still. I added some hot sauce to it and it just made this plate to die for.. . Waffles were hot and fresh. Poured some syrup all over it and I couldn't ask for anything more. Finished off all of the chicken, some of the gravy even made its way onto the waffles, but that didn't even matter because whatever was on that plate was just the right kind of balance of sweet and saltiness together. It definitely made my Sunday! OVERALL, with the new look and excellent staff, I enjoyed every minute of it. I think its nice that it was a valet for its customers because of how parking is in Phoenix. Their staff is amazing. Very courteous, polite, and exceptional. The food, BEYOND AMAZING and I will make sure I come back.. maybe even this Sunday again!
Great food. They keep it simple here by not allowing for substitutions. You just pick a number on the menu that matches what you want. Pretty much anything you order is delicious. This used to be a little hole in the wall but they re-did it - expanding the space and making it more modern looking. If you love chicken and waffles and basically comfort food, then this is the spot. It's busy at lunch time.Each time there has been a good experience.
This place NEVER disappoints. I've been here numerous times during the my 7 months of living in the Valley. Great service ALL the time.I'm from the South and this is where I go to get my soulfood fix when I don't cook lol. The fried chicken is always fresh (I order the two drumsticks and waffle combo) and flavorful. Trust me, I am the type of person who only ate fried chicken from my mom's kitchen. The kool-aid brings me back to childhood and the waffle is always made just right...golden brown and not over done.  :-) The only thing keeping me from going more are calories lol.
TERRIBLE service. We waited 45 minutes for our food. The waitresses never even came back to explain the long wait.  No 2nd cup of coffee as requested.  We were lucky to get a 4th set of silverware since we had to ask 3 times. Waitress rested her elbows on our table while talking as though she was exhausted. People at table next to us were informed they were out of eggs after a 1/2 hour wait. The food was good once it finally came but how do you recover from waiting 45 minutes?????
Great service! Great food! First time having chicken and waffles during the same meal. The waffles are super uber mouthwatering delicious. Waffles are crunchy and soft all in one. The chicken was crispy and very flavorful just how I like it! Not onlywas the experience amazing, but the atmosphere was great. Great music playing but also not too loud, which was great for my brunch date and I. Not only was all this amazing but also had valet parking. So many thumbs up for this place!
This meets my chicken and waffles expectation.  Large portions. Tasty corn fritter appetizer. Reasonably priced dishes and excellent customer service.
This place is great!! It was 5 of us and we were ALL very pleased with service and specially the food, Mmmm southern chicken, 1 waffle, a side of southern potatoes with gravy, and a corn bread muffin..  Everything cooked to perfection.. Definitely coming back..  Thanks Lo-Lo's Great job!!!
2 stars for the food that was good, ZERO stars for the horrible service.  I don't mind waiting for a table, but when you're eventually sat you shouldnt wait 20 minutes to be greeted by a server.  Never saw the server again after the order was taken until we flagged him down to pay.  No managers table touching, couldn't even find someone to ask for extra silverware.  Food was good though, it's a shame that the service was horrendous!  They need server training 101.
