One of my favorite places to stay on the strip because this is where LIGHT nightclub is!. . I also play MyVegas Slots on Facebook, so I am able to stay and dine here for free!. . The room was very clean.  There's a separate shower and tub.  They have an Express Room Service menu which guarantees your order to be in your room in 30 minutes or less, and YES I timed it and it was exactly 30 minutes.  Unfortunately, the fruit cup I got with my order was moldy but they were able to bring me up a new one and comp the order that the fruits came with, YAY!. . On our most recent stay, the front desk lady said we had a $50 food and beverage credit to use on anything, but every time I stay here I think a Room Service menu is missing.  We ended up not using it since we did not know what we could order.. . The hotel is towards the end of the strip but there are trams that take you all over like Excalibur or Luxor, and trams at those hotels to take you deeper into the strip.. . The service at the casino is very quick.  I love gambling here because of the prices and I don't get scared that I am going to run out of money before my drink arrives.. . There are plenty of dining options here, even a small shopping area, and there is also a small aquarium to visit if you don't have any plans.  I recommend staying here, but start playing MyVegas and building up your points so majority of things are free!
Ok so much to my dismay I have not reviewed Mandalay Bay, how is that possible you say, well apparently it is quite possible. So here it goes, this one of the nicest properties on the South Side of The Las Vegas Strip. The property houses some great restaurants and venues, a killer pool, and incredible rooms. Whats not to like? Nothing, that's why I am writing this great review. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
Personally hate casinos due to all the cigarette smoke.  Then you get Mandalay Bay adding insult to injury by charging crazy prices for basic items in their pseudo-convenience store.  Suites are dated as well.  Expected to find the Brady Bunch hanging out when I walked in.
Love this hotel! It's beautiful! The rooms are clean and there is so much to do in the hotel from the casino to their own aquarium. Make sure to go swimming in their man made beach listening to music and swimming through the waves. Can't wait to come back.
I stayed here for 2 nights for a girls weekend with my mom.  I haven't been to Vegas in a long time and I wanted to relax by the pool and take in the sights. The beach and the wave pool were awesome!  The lobby has ice lemon and lime water, we wanted some before we trekked out into the hot weather exploring the strip, but they were out.  We asked the guyat the desk if someone was refilling the water, he said it was in progress. He just brushed us off like we were annoying him for free water and we weren't paying guest! 10 minutes later still no water, we gave up and went on our way.. .  The room and bathroom were nice and spacious! After a long day my second night was sleepless, at 2AM there was a guy and a woman screaming and crying! The walls are paper thin, I stayed at Treasure Island and this wasn't an issue! The morning of checkout we called guest services to ask if we could have a late checkout like 1pm, they said no because they were fully booked! When we got downstairs to checkout at 11a the woman at the desk said that we could check out later since our flight was later at 6pm.  Here we are with all our bags and the opposite was being said! We did not want to haul our bags all the way upstairs and down the hallway, it was really annoying that we were told that we couldn't get a late checkout and then be told that we could have a later checkout!  The house of Blues was amazing, food was so good and reasonable for the strip! Large portions for a reasonable price!  . . After our brunch we went to the spa, I wanted to use my Mlife card to get points for buying the spa day passes, the guy said you have to go upstairs and go to the desk to add points, at the front desk the lady added the transaction to the card no problem! I spent $50 on the passes at least give me what I want!  The spa was nice free fruit, water, tea and bathrobes.
Had to go here for a convention. Stayed at the Mandalay side, not the Delano. First the good things:  Loved the entertainment.  Wow - of course - it was amazing.  The choice of restaurants also did not disappoint. Everyone who worked there was beyond thoughtful and kind.  Every single person who worked there went out of their way to say hello with a smile.  I felt welcomed and at ease.  My hotel room was roomy with a gorgeous marbled bathroom, soaking tub, beautiful shower.  Mandalay is within view of the airport.  A shuttle is needed but is very quick.. Now the not so good stuff:  You have to pay to do anything.  At all.  No coffee, no coffee pot,  no bottled water (unless you pay $5.00), no refrigerator that you can use, nothing.  A refrigerator is in your room: stocked with the typical alcohol and sodas that they want you to purchase.  If you use the refrigerator at all you will be charged a $50.00 re-stocking fee.  You can order a refrigerator for $35.00.  So I used an ice bucket to keep anything cool.  I was traveling across three time zones and was looking for tea or coffee at their 0300, my 0600.  My only option was to order room service.  Excuse me?  I am sorry, but if I go to a typical hotel and pay half the price I get free coffee, free breakfast, a newspaper etc.  Thankfully I was there for a conference so didn't have to pay for all of my meals. Fair warning: my allergies went into overdrive here and the same with other attendees.   Not sure if it was the carpeting or bedding but I was completely miserable.  Bring your Zyrtec.
We had a meeting there.   Nice clean rooms but customer service needs improvement.   I wondered why lines were so short at check in.  I am gold mlife and went to ask to extend until noon on check out day.  I didn't even get to finish my sentence and was interrupted and told "absolutely not,  no matter what your status is".  Wow!!  We brought you 5000 customers and if you treated us all like you did me, very disappointing.   I was very friendly when I approached the desk.   I understand you might have a bad day but don't be rude to customers. I had my card in my hand and wasn't demanding anything.   I think I am just really disappointed more than anything.
This place exceeded my expectations for hotels in vegas. I really had no idea that a place could be somewhat affordable and still be well worth the money. We had a two bedroom suite and the view was breathtaking. I loved going to bed at night and seeing this huge lit up pyramid outside of my window. Then waking up and seeing all of las vegas. Its at one of the ends of the strip and I guess the only downside would be travel but they make that easy for you too. There is a Tram that takes you from the hotel to excalibur free of charge. Of course there is also the option of taking a taxi to anywhere on the strip costing you from $10-$20 (any more and you are being scammed) make sure the meter in the taxi is starting at $3.50. If not, get another taxi driver. Another good point about this hotel is that is one of the closest to the airport. If you don't want to stay in a motel 6 but want to be close enough to not miss your flight, this hotel is your best bet. . . The casino: . This place is huge but not in the gigantic sense to where it takes you forever to get anywhere. It is also connected to the Luxor and Delano. There should be some shops that are around the casino so if you forgot anything such as toiletries, this is your best bet. Near the elevators in the lobby there is a connivence store but its pricey there. The downside to the casino area is the food. Its really nothing to write home about and place for the love of all that is good stay the hell away from the bayside buffet. I went there for breakfast and regretted every bite of it.. . Pool area:. It basically looks like a beach. Please make your way here even if you are just out for a walk just take a look at this place. There is a hot tub somewhere but I find that a little weird with strangers. There is a lazy river here that is probably meant for shorter people. I say this because I am 6' and the depth of  the pool is half my size. If you want to float on your back the whole time, great. If you want to walk around in the river prepare to have your legs scraped by the pools lining. Finally, the wave pool. Really cool concept but there is only one wave per like 5 mins. I know they live in the dessert and don't understand the concept of bodies of water but come on. Also they have a small section for you to swim in. Still a cool pool in my opinion just wished it was better.. . Special notes: . -Aquarium is around $17. -Border Grill - not so great (avoid the unlimited brunch special). - Take the Tram first then take a taxi if needed. All the trains are runned by computers and show up every six minutes or less.
Well, I wish I could say that Mgm and Mandalay Bay came through and showed that they really care but that is not the case.  My mom was given some $ incentive ( which was basically a slap in the face after what she has been through) but not near what she deserved.  Also, I am the one who paid the hotel bill and was hardly there and they would not credit the resort fees or anything (even though I wasn't there to use the internet, amenities, etc since I was at hospital with my mom.  Risk managements investigation is done and guest relations said they would be in contact with us after that was complete and see what more.they could do and after several messages to see when they were going to let us know they responded last night saying there is nothing else they feel they need to do.  So yes, not impressed. They also keep removing my comment on their Facebook page..which is why I love yelp...they can't remove posts!!
This our 3rd trip to Vegas this year but 1st stay at Mandalay Bay. The 2 previous times were at The Hotel. . . My only major complaint is the room/bathroom: Too cluttered with furniture, and the bathroom wasn't very clean. Some stray hairs in the tub and shower wall, and spots on the counter. . . The Hotel is way better. All rooms are suites. Bathrobes and slippers provided (without asking, like at Mandalay) and bathrooms are clean.
Beautiful hotel and super friendly and helpful staff. We were bummed that the beach was closes for "winter weather" even though it was about 70-75 degrees the whole week we stayed. The Beach Club was open and free for guests. Small pool with a hot tub and bar. The hot tub was not very warm. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with the pool experience since the hotel is well known for the pools but otherwise it was a pretty sweet stay. Unfortunately we didn't get the chance to check out the aquarium!
Mandalay Bay is one of the best on the STRIP. South STRIP location next to the on-ramp for I-15. Great bars throughout the casino. House of Blues inside, as well as many outstanding restaurants.. If you book a room through Kayak or another outside source, expect to be put at the end of a long hall with no view.
The customer service contacted me and responded in a good timely manner. Very professional. Still iffy on whether I will stay here again but customer service gets a thumbs up. The woman who first helped me on the phone does not.
I have to kick myself for not booking a room at Mandalay bay sooner!! This place has definitely made it on my top 5 hotels to stay at when I am wanting to stay on the strip! I booked my last minute reservation through MLife and upon arriving I was greeted fast through the invited guest/MLife me never check in! Shawnae I believe was her name provided some of the best service I've received! It's important to always acknowledge the customers me membership status and making request happen! I originally booked for just a deluxe room but the reservation person must've forgotten to include the fact that i wanted a high floor with a view! No worries because Shawnae made it happen and its customer service like this that keeps me coming back and staying at only MGM properties! The room I received was located on the 34th floor with an incredible view of the strip! Extremely comfortable bed and even better bathroom! There's nothing basic about these deluxe rooms and I am here to say that they are nothing short of amazing! Adding all this plus extremely good customer service equals a happy returning customer :-) great job Mandalay bay!
I stayed here for a conference (NextGen UGM) that was being held in the conference center and all I can say is HOLY COW.  This place is GIGANTIC!!!  Not only was it able to accommodate a conference of about 10,000 with ease, I would say that the majority of the people attending also stayed at the Mandalay Bay.. . If you are going to stay here then definitely bring your walking shoes.  My co-worker had a pedometer and we walked at least 10,000 steps a day going to and from the conference - that's freaking 5 miles!!  We did not have much time to explore the rest of Vegas but we more than enjoyed ourselves staying in the resort.. . I found this to be a great venue for the conference, but here's a summary:. . Rooms - I stayed in the original Mandalay tower and found the rooms to be pretty nice and spacious.  My room had a full size tub in addition to a shower.  However, I would definitely suggest you get a VIEW OF THE STRIP.  I had a "mountain" view which was pretty boring.  Also the DELANO TOWER is freaking AMAZING!!!  If you can upgrade to there I would definitely recommend it as it is much more modern and chic.. . Gym - The Cardio Center is free but it kind of sucks.  Mandalay spa charges $25 to use the much better weight room but I went to the Delano spa gym which only charged $15.. . Restaurants - Between the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay and the multitude of restaurants in the venue there are a GAZILLION choices.  Some of my favorites were Mizua sushi in the casino, Citizens' Kitchen, and the Burger Bar.  I had great meals at all three.. . Bars- Again there are a million bars here but we especially enjoyed the Foundation Room and the Mix Lounge.  The views of the strip at both are awesome.. . Casino - I'm not a big gambler, but I have to give this casino a thumbs up considering I won $500 in slots and went on a wild positive swing in blackjack.  . . Arena - The arena here is MASSIVE.  It's no wonder that Paquiao and other huge events are held here.  . . Overall, this is a fun place to stay and it's location on the strip is prime.
Nice hotel, lots of restaurants. The hotel is at the beginning of the strip so you will have to do some walking to get to the other hotels. Overall decent pricing for what you get but because of the location I would not choose it again.
My mom was contacted by risk managment today and told that I was to stop using social.media to discussing what happened at Mandalay Bay.  They last told my mom that we should.not contact hotel directly but could use social media. My question is, what is there to hide that they don't want people to know?? Everything I have posted is 100% truth which is obviously not what they want people to know.  They basically threatened my mom and said this could be bad for her if this continues and not once did they ask how my mom was doing...even though she is still having pain and discomfort ..just another sign of proof they don't care.  This could have all been avoided had they stepped up right away.
The rooms are very nice! The food court seems very far out of the way which is annoying, the casino seemed well kept and plenty of tables/slots to enjoy, although we weren't really winning. The shark reef aquarium was fun... But small. 4 stars because it's a pretty nice place to stay in Vegas with plenty of food/shopping/entertainment to enjoy.
One of the better resorts I've stayed in on the strip, and one of the more expensive ones too, but I would give it a 4 star experience overall. It's roughly $100+per night without discounts.  Since we got this complimentary room by courtesy of MyVegas, it made this review a little easier on the stars. . . The check-in process was smooth, we got a room on the 5th floor with a view of the pool area and strip, the non-smoking rooms were very clean and spacious, the only downside was how far it was from the center of the strip - so it made going to other establishment a bit more time consuming even with a car (avoid visiting during weekends on all costs - traffic is everywhere!). . . I thoroughly enjoyed the bathtub and the design of the rooms. Very open floor plan with carpets in the bed area and granite/marble in the bathrooms. Everything looked pretty clean and I liked the fact that they used lighter colored carpets - so it made everything seem brighter. Didn't try out their buffet as it didn't get too good of a review on yelp. . . Would definitely stay again in the future.
Ive been coming to the Monte for the past couple of years as my staple hotel to stay in when Im in town, but noted a few things that might turn some others away. . So the bad - first off the free wifi only works on the first two floors...and of course most rooms are higher up than that - so why are we paying a resort fee for something that doesn't work in the rooms, a bit annoying. Secondly the TV automatically is cranked way loud when you turn it on ....doesn't matter if you turn it down...turn it off and come back - the TV automatically is up to a standard that seems. Something else I noticed on my last visit were some bathroom tiles that were literally falling off wall around the floor - cosmetic but it seems like you would do a better job of keeping the basic room since since you are quicker to sell them than the high end rooms . . So the good - a number of things which is why I like it here - for one I usually win at the hotel when I do gamble which is a plus - i mean this is Vegas. The top food draw here is The Pub in the back of the casino, its big has over 300 beers on tap and is great for groups, football sundays or having a beer when you first get in  - see my review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pub-at-monte-carlo-las-vegas?hrid=rDMItdNC2AIOYUNhKHzBCQ. . The pub is in the mall area that leads towards the Aria hotel which s one of the newer higher end hotels in the area - see my review for that here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/aria-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?hrid=Ei4gkvx1pn_FyQTlEUkaQQ. . The other draw here is the pool during the hotter months - I have a review for that a well - check that out here  http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pools-at-monte-carlo-las-vegas?hrid=LqiLayTlYhiWlSfGt2Q5-A . . The casino itself is easy to get through its a bit of a longer rectangular shape and easy to navigate which I think is a plus. I also like the food court here as it stays open through the night - which Ive tested at 3 and 4am a few times . . Being a M Life players club member is a plus - it works for more than just earning comps when playing - use it when you check in, use it when you eat at the restaurants around the casino - its works all over and at other top hotels as well so jump on getting one . . All in all this is a great middle of the strip place to stay that is cheaper and gives you access to plenty
This place is not a luxury resort at all. U stayed here because this was a last minute business trip.  This is a great place if you have a youngfamily. The check in experience was nice but long. The rooms were ok. The bathroom was very outdated. The shower head didn't have good pressure. The pool area was like you were at a water park packed with families  not particularly a nice relaxing place. The restaurants were ok.  The casino was not my favorite.  The mall had mediocre stores. This is not a great hotel to stay at.
I was here twice in a short period of time.  Its one of my hotels of choice.  Its at the start of the strip and (this actually appeals to me) the hotel itself seemed quieter.  On Friday and again on Monday, the crowd was only slightly different but it could have also been due to the time I visited which was the weekend before thanksgiving.  I also recommend signing up on mlife.com, I did get some discounts on the room and I presume I'll get points of some type.. . Friday Visit - It was fairly quiet.  Not a whole lot going on anywhere.  I went to one of the restaurant's between this hotel and Luxor (review for RiRa separate) and otherwise I walked around, there wasn't a whole lot of life, gambled a little and went back to my room.  If there was more going on I think I would have been more inclined to gamble more.  I liked the room choice but it was not what I selected online.  I choose a king bed and when I checked in I was told they only had two queen's unless I wanted to pay to upgrade.  I understand there might be some fine print saying "as available" but in the digital age its silly to me that they overbook their types of rooms and then charge me to change it.  Having said that though, the $50 upgrade in my opinion was nice, I got a view of the strip and the airport and the design of the room had a nice table seating area.  Of my two visits I liked this room more and I paid more for my second room.. . Monday visit - I expected this to be more mild and it was.  I had an enjoyable time but after grabbing some food, did a little gambling and then headed back. I paid for a better room this night but ended up stuck on the back side of the hotel at the very end of a very long hall.  The room was nice overall but it lacked outlets at the desk (standard two but one had the lamp, the nearest was some distance away, for a desk for work it should have been closer).  Overall I was happy with it just the one with the table, airport and strip view was better.. . . Overall, the place is nice and clean.  I like that its more resort and less wild casino but would like for more people to visit.  All the action is definitely in the center of the strip and having a quieter experience is cool but at the same time, little action on the floor didn't really incentivize gambling.
