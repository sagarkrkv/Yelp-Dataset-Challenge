I am so happy I finally got to come here. I must say the food was amazing! We had a little bit of everything and I do not think I can choose a favorite. I have never been a fan of lobster but the lobster was phenomenal. The only dish that I maybe could have passed on was the skate wing. It was good, but it was lacking a little flavor. Our flank steak was cooked to perfection. We asked for medium, and it was great. It was soooo flavorful. Besides all of the food we ate I absolutely loved the wine! I am not a fan of wine, but I had a Riesling that was delicious. Besides the wine, we also tried a few cocktails. Our waiter, Russ, chose a cocktail for me and it was really good. It was a fortified wine and soda, it tasted like a delicious lemonade. I almost wish I had something negative to say, but I really don't. Everyone was very nice and the food was great. It was probably the best seafood I have ever had, very very fresh. Thank you so much Russ for showing us a great time. You were very helpful and attentive. The next time we come in, I will definitely be asking for you and so should everyone else.
The food was good. We ordered the Petit Dejeuner Americaine to share and it came with fresh OJ and coffee! :) Yay! It was great after a long night of partying! Refreshing! It also came with a pastry of your choice! Also, they start you off with bread! Great for your hungry tummy!
Best breakfast I've had so far in vegas! My sister and I shared a jardiniere meal, which came with 2 eggs (made any way), fresh fruit bowl, potatoes, spinach, fresh fruit juice, bread, and coffee. We also got to pick a baked good sowe got a croissant. Everything was so delicious!! The croissant was so crispy and fresh. It smelled so good too and was not oily like most croissants I've eaten. The amount of food was perfect to share for 2 girls and the price was decent too - $22. . Service was excellent as well. Our server was very attentive and watchful. Every time I looked up, he would immediately come over. Our waters were constantly refilled, and food came out pretty fast. I would definitely come back the next time I'm in town.
We had a great server and great food and drinks here for Brunch. We didn't have reservations for a Sunday brunch, but the wait wasn't too long. They have delicious bread too! It's a little pricey but a fun dining experience. My husband loved his chicken and waffles.
The Best
Well.. My family and I just ate here and the service is sub-par at best.  We had the beignets which were the best thing ever! The quiche was a little runny but good..My major ding comes from the omelette. We ordered the omelet of the day but asked them for a vegetarian version as we had a vegetarian in the group.  We told our server time we did not want the sausage or the lamb, however we received the omelette with meat. The server never apologized nor gave much attention to our table. Overall it was just a very disappointing experience for such a well established restaurant.
I was lucky enough to eat at Bouchon for both breakfast and dinner while on a recent trip to Las Vegas.. . The decor is warm and friendly as is the staff.  In particular our waiter for dinner, Senad, was extremely attentive without hovering, answered all of our questions and was extremely gracious.. . The breakfast meal was delicious.  The menu is extensive and very creative.  I had the roasted chicken and chive/bacon waffles.  I was nervous about the dish but decided to give it a chance and was rewarded.  The combination of flavors was wonderful.  . . The dinner menu included an outstanding duck confit and an equally delicious pasta of the day dish.  Each member in our party was thrilled with their meals.  The table shared an order of fries that we promptly nicknamed "crack fries".  I don't know what they do to their fries, but they are addictive!  . . Bouchon was also the only time on our entire trip that nobody could fit in dessert after the meal.  Be prepared to bring your appetite when you go.
Made reservations via OpenTable for 7:30PM but arrived early and was seated immediately. The setup of the restaurant is classic bistro but not crowded. We chose several dishes from the menu to enjoy and each one was prepared exceedingly well, though french fries were over salted. The service was well paced and classic. The wait staff extremely well trained and mannered. Everything about Bouchon screams excellence.
One of the best restaurants  I've ever been to. Went with my gf and my sister. Awesome service with great recommendations. The bone marrow dish was amazing. Truffle fries I would also say were probably the best fries I've ever had. The French Onion soup was basically like drinking a steak. It was so rich and incredible. Overall a must visit if you live in Las Vegas.
Bouchon is THE place I take my dearest friends and family to celebrate "special" occasions!  Love the fact that they have a separate elevator that takes you directly to the restaurant from the parking garage so you don't have to walk through the casino.  Depending on the hours of the day, expect to wait as they do not take reservations.  . . Their bread (with phenomenal butter and jam) is a great way to start the meal!  I love their coffee... it is always strong but the temperature can be hotter, in my opinion.  I LOVE their Saumon Fume (smoked salmon with petite baguette, chive cream cheese, red onion, tomato, & capers)!  4 out of 5 times, I will order that dish as you can NEVER go wrong!  I've tried the Hachis de Boeuf (corned beef hash served with two eggs) and all sort of their omelet specials of the day but l will always regret that I didn't order my Saumon Fume!  . . Why did I give Bouchon 4 stars versus 5?!  The truth is... it's the people working there.  Not sure what it is but the employees NEVER smile!  The front desk hostesses (there are always 2-3 of them) are always busy talking to each other.  They NEVER smile and always give you that "pissed-off" look like you are such a burden when you arrive.  As for the servers ...  Well,... to be honest, I think I only had ONE GREAT experience with a gentleman while the rest of them are just "order takers".  For such a fancy restaurant, you would think that they would be happier to give you a 5-star service dining experience.  I laugh when they give you the check and on the bottom of the bill, there's the tips suggestion:  18%  is $xx.xx/ 20%  is $xx.xx... Um, I'm sorry!  Being in the service industry myself, please note that gratuity is not an entitlement!  It has to be earned.  Just saying...
I came here for brunch and I wasn't impressed. With the amount of stars yelpers reviewed it I expected a lot more. I got waffles and eggs benedict. Both were ok. The eggs benedict was cooked pretty well with the inside egg perfectly cooked at the right point of runnyness but the hollandaise sauce tasted average. Also I would advise against ordering any girly cocktails. None of them tasted good. Get your drinks elsewhere. . . On the bright side I liked how there's patio seating and how the sunlight floods into the restaurant from the windows in the mornings.
We have become slight regulars here when we have our mini stay cations.  Every time besides 1 we have had excellent service.  (not going to dock for one rude comment by one server, one time when we were there beyond closing entertaining guests)  All most every time we can be seated almost immediately.  The hosted are nice and accommodating and water is brought promptly.. . We keep coming back because the ambiance is so soothing even when the place is paced to noise is spread so it is never loud.  The servers are well versed in the menu and are always fast and efficient, if they don't have an answer they will find a answer.. . They have a large wine collection to choose from and a nice scotch for the man.  I usually splurge because when we come here and have cosmos because we are not driving.  The cosmos are perfect not to strong and not a vodka cranberry!  They have a well stocked bar and many specialty drinks for those who prefer others.. . We are not big on ordering dinners here because we like to get a selection of our favorites.  . . We love to get a plate of oysters they usually have a west coast and east cost selection so if you have a preference you should be covered.  We like the west coast oyster but have a few favorites from the east as well.  If you don't know ask they will help you decide! . . We also get a Fromages (cheese plate) one mild soft for me and tow of the smellier the better for him.  The usually do good but he would prefer even stinkier! . . Foie Gras either a plate or a tub of the butter (a small tub is to much for two people) both options are really delicious. . . We usually get Truffle Pommes Frites (french fries) but the didn't have them last time so sad so we will have to find something new next time.. . We have gotten many other things but these are our favorites, the menu does change and has changed so just go for it.  Every thing we have had has been good.
Yep, go ahead and go to Bouchon! The restaurant is very pretty and the service is exceptional. Our server was named Gary and he was a extremely professional and helpful. The french onion soup, the french fries with truffle oil and the chocolate mouse are a must! The escargot and bone marrow were good but, I've had better. Over all, we thoroughly enjoyed Bouchon and we will return.
We had an unbelievable meal here. Started at the bar and were helped by the Cicerone bartender. When seated, we started with deviled eggs and pate. The pate was out of this world. Great accompaniments. Then we had the escargot, which was amazing, very true to the French style preparation. We split the steak frites with a side of cauliflower gratin. Service was great, atmosphere is a great break from the craziness on the strip. Highly recommend!
Our friends have been raving about this place, every time they come to Vegas they have brunch here.  So they wanted us to experience this place and me, being a green horned foodie in training, was looking forward to the experience.  It was what I expected with impeccable service and a place to live in the moment and enjoy each bite.  We order the pastry basket, American breakfast, chicken and waffles and shared them all and the gravy for the chicken had bits of bacon and chives - among the four of us which was plenty for a light breakfast.  Tip for the brunch, come early as we came at 9 AM and there was no waiting.  But by the time we left, long waits.  So enjoy the experience, come early!  All were delightful and I normally don't eat a big breakfast so sampling these dishes was just perfect for my small appetite.  I can't wait to come here for dinner to try the mussels!
Wonderful spot for brunch. Sitting just by the big French doors facing the garden elevates the whole atmosphere of Bouchon to the next level. Baked goods, freshly made butter, and seasonally house made jam were all too delicious for words. However, when it comes to the plated food options I just expected a little something more for a place that bears the Thomas Keller fame.
We were very happy with our food and service.  Will definitely be going back.
This location is fairly hard to find. It's located next to The Venetian Theater, behind the escalators. It's a very limited menu compared to the other location by The Venetian Clock Tower. Most of the items are sold out as people going to/from the theater or from the casino buys items from here for convenience and none of the pastries are made here on-site since it's literally a tiny stand. No seating available as it's a take-and-go location. The items here didn't look as good as the other location as well (like they've been sitting out for quite some time).. . I came here to get the macrons but they had only three flavors left and all looked old. Since they didn't have the flavor I wanted, I went to the other location. Great place if you need something quick to eat or a coffee, but if you're looking for a specific item, I highly suggest going to The Venetian Clock Tower location.
I didn't dislike this place, but it was exceedingly average, and definitely below par for a 'fancy Vegas restaurant' attached to a famous chef. . . Highlights: . - some of the best oysters I've had in my life. We got 3 each of East and West coast oysters, and they were both delicious. . - drinks were on point. I ordered a girly raspberry liquor-based drink which was fruity but not TOO sweet. Boyfriend said the Manhattans were impeccable. . . And that's it. The bone marrow was pretty good, but forgettable. Both of our main courses - steak and a salmon-based special - were not bad but extremely average. There are a bunch of lower maintenance and lower-priced restaurants in LA with better food than this. . . Overall, dead average. I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend (unless they wanted a meal of 100% oysters and nothing else), but I wouldn't wince in sympathy if I heard they'd gone here either.
After much deliberation of where my parents and I should celebrate my 25th birthday, we decided for classic french fare at Bouchon. I had already pored over the menu online and knew I wanted a smattering of oysters, foie gras, cheese, terrine, etc. and I didn't know how I was going to choose. . . Logistically, the restaurant is incredibly hidden away, and all the signs on the main casino floor take you to Bouchon Bistro which is a casual cafe. We had to ask the concierge where to go and he told us to take the elevator upstairs to the guest floor and then walk down a long hallway? Yikes. After a short wait we were taken to a table by the service station... not ok. Asked to move to a nicer booth (the restaurant was not packed, and it was my birthday after all ;) ) and we were surrounded by couples and other birthday celebrations. . . I started with an excellent glass of sparkling wine and 1/2 dozen oysters, 2 of differing varieties. My mom and I shared the 2.5 oz. foie gras terrine which was soo smooth and delicious it was basically like eating meat flavored butter (which someone should invent). We all ordered a salad, I had the Salade Maraichere au Chevre Chaud, and my dad had the Salade de Cresson et d'Endives au Roquefort et Noix, watercress with roquefort and walnuts, except it didn't come with any roquefort so we had to flag our waitress down to ask for it on the side. He had a ribeye special for his entree, my mom had a HUGE bowl of the most delicious moules frites I've ever had, and I had an appetizer portion of the duck confit because I was stuffed to the gills at that point already! We wanted the bone marrow as well but sadly they were out of it that evening. We also ordered a 1/2 carafe of a California Pinot, they have a great wine list in all sizes btw, and they brought out a complimentary lemon tart for my birthday. . . The food was great, rustic but refined French cuisine, but the service could have been better. I would still jump at the chance to go back again, and for a nice restaurant on the Strip, it doesn't break the bank compared to some other options.
Bouchon may have ruined me for all other brunches. It's just too good! We started with half a dozen oysters on the half shell, followed by the roasted chicken with bacon/chive waffles, and the white sausage with scrambled eggs and croissant, washed down with a spicy bloody mary.. . Oh-hohhh boy. Absolute perfection. Every part of it. Every single bite. Every little sip.. . A perfect brunch.
Dining at Bouchon is always a special treat! I have yet to have the pleasure of coming here for dinner, but I'm a big fan of their weekend brunch. I've celebrated my birthday here and took the day off from work to do so - which was totally worth it. They do not take reservations for brunch, so you have to come and give your name, but I've never waited too long. Even during my bachelorette party weekend, where they said the table for 8+ was 45 minutes, we got seated in 10 minutes. If there is a wait, they have a cute little seating area and usually pastries for you to sample. They have some daily specials, like a quiche of the day or soup of the day. Their quiches are perfectly soft and pillowy on the inside. I'm actually not a huge fan of their chicken & bacon chive waffles, but since everyone else raves about them, don't let my opinion stop you. One of my must orders is a side of fries - though I do wish they gave slightly bigger portions of ketchup and mayo, I always feel like such a classless fool when I have to ask for more. If you're with a larger group of people, the pastry basket is always a nice way to start off brunch as well while your entrees come in. I was so hungover and sick during the morning of my bachelorette weekend, I couldn't enjoy eating here. I sustained myself on ginger ale and their tasty cauliflower soup, while i watched everyone enjoy their mussels and steaks. I did have some of the foie gras that was ordered for the table - amazingly silky, and a big hit with all the Californians. I was so jealous of everyone's enjoyment, my husband and I ate here the next weekend so I could enjoy Bouchon like how it's meant to be enjoyed. I actually prefer sitting inside since it's beautifully decorated. The outside patio is right next to the pool and some bodies are just not meant to be looked at while you eat brunch. Their champagne cocktails are all really interesting, so you don't have to be basic and get a mimosa, there are a ton of other options. One of my favorite things to eat here is actually complimentary - I love eating their warm baguettes with the mustard on the table while my husband prefers spreading jam and butter on it. . . I will  definitely be back here several more times and hopefully get to enjoy their dinner menu soon.
We had lunch today and after reading all reviews and watching commercials about this restaurant I was a little bit disappointed. I had their famous mussels and they were tasteless, but a lot. My husband had turkey burger with french fries.He said that franch fries from McDonalds tastes better :-)The most I liked from dining experience in this restaurant is peach jam, butter and baguette. Maybe dinner is better here, but I won't go back.
We always come here for pasteries every time we come to Vegas and spend abou $60 on things like chocolate crossaints, cheese danish, apple tart, almond crossaints, macaroons (sea salt and caramel), and cakes.  Omg, they are all excellent!  If only we could get our drinks quicker. Forget about ordering coffee, you'll be waiting just as long as when you purchased your pasteries.
Out of all the places we ate in Vegas, this stood out as the best value by far.. . Not that it was cheap -- no, no -- but we really felt that we got our money's worth here.  Most Vegas joints are ridiculously overpriced and serve food that, while good, isn't nearly reflective of the benjamins you lay down.  (Look, I'm street!). . So we started with the bone marrow and the pate.  Oh, bone marrow, where have you been all my life when you could have been clogging my arteries?  The waiter (Michael, who was AWESOME) showed me how to smear it on my bread.  Yum.  The pate was tasty -- but eclipsed by the marrow.  I had a Sazerac and my wife had a Moscow Mule to accompany -- both top notch jobs by the bartender.. . The main courses -- a Lamb sirloin for the lady, and a kilo of mussels and truffle frites for me.  Both were amazing, fantastic, to die for good.  The mussels were steamed in wine, mustard, and garlic with some ham thrown in for good measure.  The frites were served in a cone that had some decidedly non-Euclidean properties to it -- no matter how many we ate, there were still more in the cone.. . Listen to the wait staff on the wine and/or beer pairings.  You're welcome.. . We didn't eat dessert.  Because we were full to bursting on the rest.  The portions are generous, so go hungry.. . Five stars, no reservations.
