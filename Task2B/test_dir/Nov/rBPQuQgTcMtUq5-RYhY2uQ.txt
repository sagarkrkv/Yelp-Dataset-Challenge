This is my second time eating here at the buffet. I came here as a child with my parents and from what I remember the place inside looks the same. The food is different than other buffets on the strip and that's always refreshing. . . I love the crepes they make you fresh! Only problem was that when you order a savory crepe, they weren't cooking it long enough so the cheese and/or ham, whatever it's stuffed with, will be left unmelted or cold inside. I made a small complaint to our wonderful server Mimi and she let the chef and her manager know. I went back for a second serving and I also asked the chef to please cook it longer and it was so delicious!! . . My boyfriend and I were served warm crab legs (bonus for being a platinum rewards member) and the legs were good as well. . . Bottomless mimosas are a nice touch, we didn't drink as much as we normally would but the refills on the champagne were a little slow. I just didn't care because I didn't feel like getting drunk. . . Didn't get to try all the food because I was in love with the crepes and waffles (so fresh!) and their different potatoes and Mac and cheese is good. Their eggs Benedict, I'm sorry to say, is pretty bad. Dry, over-cooked egg with a hard muffin and tasteless hollandaise sauce, that was a little disappointing. . Their macarons are ok; they're made right texture-wise but the filling is just super sweet chocolate and not very good. That's a shame because macarons are amazing and it should bea highlight at a French buffet. . . All in all, great experience again at this buffet. Mimi is a wonderful server she was funny and kind and took her time to make sure everything was to our liking. Even the ladies at the front who take your payment were very friendly. I can't wait to come back and eat here again(especially the crepes!)
I didnt like this buffet! I wont go again. We can buy one meal or 24h, fortunately, we just bought for one meal.  For this price we could have a pretty better food. The food was "okay", and I only enjoy the dessert. I wont recommend it for anyone.
Excellent Excellent Excellent the Gold Standard of buffets. The Bacon here is so good it's other worldly. A great array of delectable delights. Creamy sauces and that bacon did I say bacon....superb!! Fresh breads and the eggs were fantastic!! Come hungry and enjoy the food coma....
I really enjoyed this buffet. Mostly because of the atmosphere and there was a huge selection to choose from. I didnt stay at the paris but glad i went through to come across this place
My favorite buffet in Vegas.  So many good vegetables and meat that I am almost able to control the carb overload that I expect when I see the amazing desserts. . . This one offers reservations so DEFINITELY plan the day before so you can skip the loooong lines and lengthy waits.  You will walk right in with a reservation just like the high rollers.
This is the best buffet out of the buffet of buffet deal. The Le Village buffet is located in the paris hotel. The buffet has beautiful decor giving you a romantic outdoor feel without dealing with bugs!  In addition to the beautiful outdoor section they have nice sectioned off rooms with really quaint french decor.  The food has always been really delicious at these buffet ( maybe not the best but I think the best bargain for the quality of atmosphere and food) The dessert area is really mind blowing. I dare you to leave without wanting to eat something from their dessert bar! IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN!  I had to try everything from the creme brulee, cheescake, cake balls, parfaits, flan, and colored macaroons. I'm still shocked that I don't have diabetes from going to this buffet. My friends loved this buffet so much we had to come here twice!
I especially found the LIVE BIRDS living in the trees inside the dining area of interest.. . Food was good and service was OK, fine I guess for a buffet.. . I have been here 4 or 5 times before and will probably come again.
The food was average at best. There were no plates to be found on multiple stations. The prime rib was extremely rare, and we like rare but not that rare! The flow of the restuarant was not organized and did not seem to have any thought to it. I would not go again.
Came here with a bunch of girlfriends for brunch and I must say this was one of the best brunch buffets I have been to in a very long time.. Everything was made fresh, tasted good and the servers were helpful and attentive.  My favorite station was the crepe... both savory and sweet made to your liking... everything tasted delicious!!  never a long line and many different types of food to please any palette.. . Cute decoration makes you think you are sitting in a lil cafe in a village in Paris... very nice touch.  Very satisfied for coming here and will definitely be back.
Buffet was pretty good.  Loved the crab legs.  The apple cinnamon crepe was exceptional.  Glad we got there early because the line moved slow.
I saw a COCKAROACH wondering around in the food bar. I told one of the employees and they simply killed it as if it was something normal. I can't imagine what the back must be like! GROSS!
They should give negative star choices too!!! Had Thanksgiving dinner here,it was horrible! Stood in line for an hour, paid $40 for food I wouldn't feed my dogs!! It was all flavorless and cardboard tasting!! Went for our second plate and by the time we got back to our table another party was seated at our table!! By the time they moved those people and seated us all of our food was cold!!! First time ever I've gone hungry on Thanksgiving!!!
The buffet at Paris was great! Good selection, great food and mimosas to go along. We went for brunch and had crab legs, shrimp, clams, and everything else! It is pretty pricey at $35 each but they gave us a 2 dollar discount for having a players card (really 2 bucks WoW ??? ) . Anyway, overall experience was good. We had mimosas with our food which was nice. They had a nice selection of desserts and sweets. Really wanted to try a crepe but was way too full. . Only complaint would be the price. But all the other buffets charge as much too which is pretty stupid.
