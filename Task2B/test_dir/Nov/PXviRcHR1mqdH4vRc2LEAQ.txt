Thanks Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives for putting these guys on the map.  My husband is a burger connoisseur, and he was very excited to check this place out.. . My advice to anyone coming here for the first time is to save your appetite because their portions are HUGE. They definitely have a lot to offer, and you need multiple visits to try all the stuff that looks good on the menu.
This restaurant has been on my To Do list since it opened some 4 years ago.  We decided to share 2 different Asian influenced burgers.  The Ronin burger included caramelized onions, Japanese coleslaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq and yuzi citrus aioli plus Kiki's - sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, Gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aiole.  . . We also shared an order of sweet potato fries with yuzi citrus aioli.  At first glance I could not imagine how I would get my mouth around the burgers, but most of the height came from the soft roll as the actual angus patty likely weighed in at a 1/3 of a pound.  We both felt Kiki beat out Ronin and, though the overall experience was good, I did not feel wowed by the experience and consider the burgers to be overpriced.
It exceeded our expectations! Finally made our way here and it didn't disappoint. We started with the strawberry lemonade and apple lychee soda, the fresh strawberry in the lemonade definitely made it a winner. We wanted to start with the cauliflower and crab dip, which they had run out of (ugh), but we had the pork belly buns and they were yummy! We got the Kiki and Mr. Ho's burgers with the Parmesan truffle fries... Everything was TO DIE FOR! I would highly recommend this spot. We did come in kind of late, so the service was so-so, but with food this good, it completely made up for it. Can't wait to come back and try new things on the menu!
First time I have ever eaten here I was mesmerized how amazing and flavorful there burgers are! One day when I get married I want to order mini bachi burgers to pass around to my guests to they can taste how amazing the burgers are!
Was recommended this place by a woman at the nail salon adjacent to the restaurant. We ordered a salad which was nothing special, some garlic fries which were DELICIOUS and a protein style burger. The highlight of the meal was the fries so if you go there definitely order some garlic fries (the sauce is comes with is also fantastic). The burger was good, it had a hint of a korean flavor to it (like a kalbi marinade) and I enjoyed it. The salad was really nothing special so I would pass on that. . . Service was excellent and the crowd was young and hip. Really enjoyed and will be back soon. Thank you Bachi Burger!
One of the best burgers I have had!  Try the Ox Tail Fries, yup, you heard right!!  Just give them a try!!. . Japanese twist to the American classic burger. Relaxed and casual ... making it a great antidote to the typical Las Vegas eatery. Oh, and its close to the airport for those that need to dineand skip town.
This is my favorite burger anywhere. I frankly don't understand how you can not like their burgers. Compared to the competition of gourmet burgers out there this place is very very reasonably priced. Everything is always cooked perfectly with a nice crust on the patties and perfectly medium on the inside. I highly recommend the miyagi San, it is out of this world. I come here at least 2 times a month and never get sick of it, every one of my out of town friends have said its the best burger they've ever had. Can't recommend or enough
A million stars. Hands down the best burger on the planet. Opulence in burger creativity. Shogun. Sho nuf! If you haven't done it do it. If you've done it do it again.
Best veggie burger I've ever tried.  I was not expecting all that flavor!! Layers upon layers of pure goodness. It was so big that I had to deconstruct it so I can fit it in my mouth.  Made the process even more fun! I like to get individual flavors, as well as the combination.  The patty itself was fantastic!. I really wanted fries, so I decided to order just the plain ones so I can really get the awesomenss of a good fry...and they did not disappoint. Crunchy, not too salty, and it comes with great homemade ketchup.. . Love the vibe...great service...great food.  I will be a regular here.
Had a great pre dinner with great aps and main course. A bottle of wine and life was good. Not too long of a line but be prepared to wait most of the time. Worth it!
I am always coming back here! I crave it and it's by far my favorite place to eat! Fried egg on your burger is a MUST! Doesn't taste the same without it! Great atmosphere and it feels good to be back in Vegas!
Everytime I go here, it's awesome. We have nothing like it in Jacksonville and the dishes are so unique and flavored so well that you ask yourself "why didn't I think of that?!?" . . This go around, me and my buddy had the oxtail chili cheese fries, pork buns, Kiki burger, ronin burger and the Parmesan truffle fries. . . The oxtail chili cheese fries were really good. The oxtail was so tender like pulled beef and made the chili so much better than just regular ground beef chili. . . The pork buns were great! The pork belly was braised really well and the pickle and eggs together in the bun made the perfect combo. The side sauce (homemade hoisin?) was the kicker that sent it over the top. . . The burgers are sooooo good here and so original. It's hard to describe the intense Asian flavors and the combinations that each burger has. All I can say is that you must try for yourself. Every burger I've had here has that perfect balance to create a tsunami of umami. Sweet, salty and savory mixed with sour pickled... And that potato bun... two perfect pillows holding everything together. . . The Parmesan truffle fries are everything you expect. Shoestring fries topped with Parmesan cheese with a hint of truffle and topped with a porcini sauce. Really good side dish for the burgers. . . Service was impeccable and the cleanliness was comforting. Always a great experience and will always come back!
It must have been mile 5 or so of the Spartan Super Race when I started to really curse myself for what I got into. Hungry, tired, hot and cold (yes, it's possible), and with a leg that kept cramping. That's when a large group came up behind me encouraging each other. "Do it for Bachi Burger!" "ohhh.. yeaa.. Bachi Burger".. "mmm" and all kind of positive responses ensued. Curious, I asked, what is this Bachi Burger and where can I get it. The reviews there and on yelp ended up being great, so we decided to make sure we checked it out before we left Vegas. . . It did not disappoint. First, we ordered the oxtail fries. Yes, I know it sounds strange and not necessarily appealing. But wow! It was really good! The fries were not soggy, the oxtail super tender and they added a fried egg on top. And I really really love a fried egg. Got to try the garlic truffle fries and those were good too. For the burger, I tried the Ronin burger. I enjoyed the quality of the beef and the mix of different and unique flavors. Friends also tried their shakes and really enjoyed them. Definitely a good find! I am excited to see they have opened locations in LA and Pasadena!
All I have to say about this place is I had the best hamburger in my entire life when wagyu beef with foie gras totally awesome.Service was good and they had a great beer selection I definitely will be going. back sorry forgot to take pictures also try their truffle fries
Ordered a buncha food and didn't regret it one bit!! I saw this place on triple D and I couldn't wait to trek out to Vegas to check it out. Ordered the oxtail fries, truffle fries, truffle edamame, Kiki burger and ronin burger. It was all great tasting. If you're in Vegas you gotta go here ASAP!
This is the second time we've been here.. . Must have had a change in management, but the changes was for the better.  The staff expedited orders much more rapidly.   Communication was more clear this time with their team and was apparent in servicing guests.. . Had the Kiki Burger was was awesome.  If you don't like mushrooms, then this is not for you.  Flavoring of the garlic aioli, mushrooms, and bacon were perfect.  My husband had the Spicy Miso burger (topped with egg) which is more of his preference.  We had regular fries, which we could share.  On previous occasions we tried the sweet potato fries and parmesan fries.  All are great accompaniments.. . A group could fit; however, this location is fairly small in size, so if it was busy expect a long wait.. . Total before tax came to $27 for two burgers a one fries. Hopefully that will help you gauge what to expect for prices.
Tried this place on the recommendations of several food blogs. It was certainly worth the stop!. Started off with the grilled shishito peppers which weren't too hot but quite flavorful. I ended up trying the Miyagi-san Wagyu Burger, which simply put was impeccable. The beef was buttery, the addons were fantastic and every bite was a myriad of taste. I imagine every burger has this taste so I'm looking forward to subsequent visits. Also tried the truffle parmesan fries which were the perfect accompaniment. Service was a bit slower than what i expect from a casual place but it wasn't an inconvenience.. . Finally, this location is off the regular path which was great as there was no line on a Saturday night. Overall, a great experience. Thanks Bachi!
Went here because of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Burgers are exotic and non-traditional. If your a traditional burger kind of person, don't bother. Burgers are juicy and very meaty. Noodles are delicious as well, next time I personally would prefer noodles over the burger. Service was so-so, hence no 5 star rating. Will go back and try something different.
Overall it was great!. . I've had ramen here before which I love. First time trying their burgers and I was impressed. Don't come when you're really hungry cause there's always a wait. Anywhere between 10-30 minutes. . . Don't get any of their boba drinks, Thai tea boba was pretty gross. Burgers are amazing and great size for the price though! I got the miyagi-san and it was so good! I also took a bite of the kimchi kalbi and that was good too. A little spicy but good.. . I do recommend it for a different burger joint!
Always a must stop for me when coming to vegas. The burgers have so much flavor and so juicy. The fries can hold their own as well. Cant go wrong with the truffle or the sweet potato. Love this place!
The steamed pork buns are so tender and the spicy miso ramen was good! I love the matcha green tea, however. I didn't try a burger. That's on my to do list next time.
This was a great burger hang out joint!  The beer selection was awesome and the fries were amazing. The burgers that we tried were super yummy!  Great prices and Melissa was adorable and efficient!
It's not a place to sit around for a long conversation just eat and get out. On Sunday's it's long line be considerate there's other people waiting to grub.
Great place, their strawberry soda was amazing so was the steamed porkbelly buns.   We got the Bunh mi and miso burger both were amazing!
Save you're money and go to Wendy's (at least the chili is better there). . . The wait was ridiculous for starters. Packed in a crowed waiting area in full view of open tables isn't a great way to start your dining experience. When we were finally sat, a hurried bus boy drops two waters and disappears, he would be the only acknowledgement from any of the staff for over 20 min. . . When the waitress eventually showed up to take our order she informed us they were either out of items or did not stock such crazy hamburger toppings like dill pickles. . . The food arrives its sub par at best. You'll enjoy you burger better at any fast food establishment. The ox tail chili was reminiscent of the area it originated on the ox (Hormel had a better recipe), and I don't know what the "plantation sweet tea" is supposed to be but it damn sure isn't tea. . . Year another "hipster db my menu is hip and cool cause we put crazy things on things that never should go together" place. Again don't waste your time.
Stop what you're doing and get a burger from here. All burgers here are made from wagyu beef. For those who dont know, Wagyu refers to several breeds of cattle bred for intense marbling and producing a high percentage of rich unsaturated fat. Basically this beef is high quality AF.. . First of all, the restaurant is usually busy. So you may need to wait 10-30 minutes. BUT it's worth the wait. The staff is friendly, cleanliness is spot on, and the ambiance is casual. Enough with the basics, let's talk about the food.. . I got the Banh mi burger. Under the bun is a patty made of Angus beef, pork and shrimp, topped with a thin slice of grilled pork pate, crisp lettuce and hints of lemongrass, herbs and curry aioli. On the side is are pickled slivers of carrot and daikon radish, with jalapeno slices and a shallow bowl of nuoc mam, a sweet sauce with a marmalade tang and a hint of garlic. The burger was very juicy, and "fluffy" if that's even a right term to describe it's texture. Basically the burger is cooked right, not too tough, and very meaty. It tasted really good, perfect for your inner carnivore. The burger is delicious and filling,  enough said. The fries are meh. Their tough and barely salted. It's the sauces you get with them that makes them good.. . A great place to go too. Will be back again.
the wait was horrendous. packed full of people inside so we were waiting on the side walk in the vegas heat. 120 deg just waiting for people to give up and leave.. once we got in there were plenty of seats not even being touched. so im not sure what the hell was going on where we had to wait over a hour outside when there were tables upon tables of empty seats. . food wise, it was ok- i wasnt blown away but it was good.. the burger is a little intimidating,  you read all these funny things like what the hell is this- with no explanation and no waitstaff to help you because they are close to non existent other then to bring the food out. but you muster up some courage and pick something.. we got chili fried chicken- which was good, very crispy even though it was smothered in sauce. . and we both got the ronin burger. a messy disaster but tasty.. with sweet potato fries.. . the food was decent. everything else was kinda lacking.
I've been to this exact location a couple times.  The service was great, our waitress nailed it and was always around making sure we had what we need.  Overall it felt like the staff were well organized and worked well together.  I ordered a cider but it was bottled and seemed like just a selection from the supermarket and not really chosen to pair with a food and for specific qualities of the cider itself.  I got the kalbi burger and it was perfect top to bottom, the flavors worked perfectly and was just an awesome burger.  I order some fried but wasn't too jazzed about this visit's selection (truffle fries), but I'll chalk that one up to my choice.  My last visit had a better fry selection.  . . Overall I'm a fan and glad they have a couple in LA.  It's a great burger spot off the strip and not a far drive away.
A friend of a friend recommended this place and what a treat to find it to be as good as they exclaimed.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  The place was busy but there wasn't an overly long wait.  We had the Kiki burger with Wagyu and the Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger with a shared order of truffle fries.  The burgers were cooked (per chef's recommendation) perfectly and the homemade buns melted in your mouth.  This is not a fast food style restaurant and is a bit pricy, but well worth every penny.
Burgers were def on point! Had the Miyagi-san & it was delicious! Service sucked though, unfortunately. The bus boy was hella cool but the waiter was AWOL most the night. The Thai was bomb! All in all, good place to eat but bad service! FYI, if you don't like your buns toasted, let them know, cuz they'll toast the hell out your buns! Lol
This place is the most amazing place on earth. This is for sure apart of every trip I take to Vegas. It's refreshing to go into a restaurant and see a variety of folx. Often places that are super good have a particular clientele but this place has all genres. The plantation sweet tea w/pineapple and mint is the most flavorful beverage and I've tried to duplicate it at home and it's not the same. The best thing here is the oxtail fries. It's Spicey and sweet and yummy in my tummy fries w/egg and oxtail so who doesn't want that. In terms of a meal I get the non ground beef items bcus I feel some sort of way abt it but the first time I came I got the pork belly buns and they were a nice surprise. The pork is crispy and I actually like the mixture of varieties of crunch and softness. However this time I got  the Lonely Bird which was perfect. This thing seriously has a nice bun and all the flavors jus taste nice in my mouth. Anyways my friends had the Banh Mi and Mr Ho's which of course are delissshhhh. My advice go of the strip and eat and explore but clearly you are if your reading this review.
