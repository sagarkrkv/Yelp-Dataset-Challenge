I had an awesome experience staying in one of the Aria sky suites. From the private check-in area behind those gold doors, to the great attention to detail during turndown, service was first class all the way. Only thing that could have been better would be a higher thread count for the bedding.
Generally a nice hotel with nice amenities, but Vegas standards are high. The rooms are spacious and clean. The bathroomis delightful, with a luxurious tub (many photos have been posted). The in-room technology is great, though my AC never cooled the room very well. The staff is abundant and attentive. Best of all, the HVAC systems minimize the smoke in the casinos. . . There are some down sides. First, it seems unremarkable for a newer property on the strip. It is contemporary, but uninteresting. My biggest problem was with the ironing board. They bolted the iron holder to the board, just like a Motel 6 would. Anyone who actually irons will quickly realize that renders half the board useless. Want to iron a shirt, you'll have to iron the back in 3 inch strips. Ironing pants? Plan to move them three times per leg. Pathetic for a hotel that caters to business and upscale travelers.
At first I thought a little pricey but it is worth every penny. Everything was delicious except for the crab legs, on the dry side. Other than that I enjoyed every bite.
Very happy with the service at Aria.  They even cleaned our room at 7pm at night!  Thank you!!!. . Quiet, clean, sexy and comfortable hotel.. . The casino always has a good vibe, great bars and Sage tasting menu was delicious.. . Thank you for a great stay!
I really enjoyed my stay here! Upon entrance to my hotel suite the music automatically turns on and the window drapes automatically open! Very Impressive! Contemporary and new furniture and fixtures. The bath tub/shower condo was a separate glassed room from the vanity and it also had a private toilet area. Perfect city view across from the Monte Carlo. Pay per view was only 11.99 per movie and the casino Craps table was a blast with an awesome staff! Try the Aria buffet. It's the best we had in Vegas! The lines for check in and check out for the hotel, however, were long and so was the delivery time for room service, but other than that this hotel was fab and I will be staying her my next visit to Vagas for sure!
Fantastic place to stay. The only downside would be that it might be a bit costly for most people (I'm no exception). Nonetheless, I suppose it is to be expected for a hotel in Vegas. The architecture and design throughout the hotel is fantastic. Service is great and so is the food. . . Depending on when you're coming, expect some of the following:. . $300-400+/night. $44 buffet. Food is roughly $15-20 per entree at the cafe. . Misc drinks roughly $5-8 (non alcohol). Awesome mini bar but expect average items to be $7-10 (not including alcohol). $70 - If you need a haircut by hotel barber (had no choice)
Have stayed at Aria multiple times, always happy with the place.  The hotel is nice and modern, the rooms are well kept, great bathrooms, like the touchpad room controls even though there is a lag in the controls and they can be tough after a night of drinking, they are awesome.  . . The staff was very friendly, room service was right on when called.  Check in lines can be long but they do well trying to speed themalong.  Generally the place has a great vibe throughout it. . . The gym is amazing, plenty of equipment and well maintained.  The spa is fantastic but the services are a bit pricy, but it is Vegas so to be expected.  . . The gambling floor is nice and the dealers can be very helpful to new players.  Only thing I would like to see changed is to get some dealers that are more engaging, they are nice enough but ted to be very quiet and almost disinterested, definitely need some funner dealers.
This is my new hotel in Vegas. I would always stay at the Ballagio and i completely fell in love with this place. It is smaller than your "mega casinos" which I love. The rooms here are great and I love the whole property. The service is exceptional. I really loved the pool as well. The food at the pool is pretty good as well. Every room has a view. I opted for the room without a view of the strip and I still had a nice view of another casino. Everything is high tech in the room and I loved it. Check it out. It's an awesome spot.
The hotel and conference area is nice and clean.  The employees were very friendly and helpful.  Prices were a bit on the very high side ($38 for the buffet and $7 beers at the bar), but I guess that's typical for the area.
Pros:.  beds are amazingly fluffy- like sleeping on a cloud, . restaurants a plenty from american to asian to dessert, . separate check in line for those that have mlife unlike Bellagio where they use that as a plus on mlife but is actually not an option. . . Cons: . self park and valet are on the opposite end of the hotel, it's quite a walk over to just get your car, . the remote SUCKS...i feel like i'm literally breaking my fingers each time i have to press the button and you have to press it about 5 times before it actually works- and no there's nothing blocking the tv range, it's just awful for some reason.. the towels aren't the best- feels like i'm not really dried off and is actually kind of coarse to use.. Wifi- it's a hit or miss with wifi, was fine using my computer, phone could not even connect.
THE ROOM/HOTEL: This has to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at! I recently stayed here and got a one bedroom Sky Suite. With the sky suites you get an amazing view, chauffeur to and from the airport and so many other perks. The sky suites are a separate building, entrance and check in area from the standard rooms at Aria. Our room was very spacious with a living room, dining room, two bathrooms (one of them being super massive with three sinks and a bath tub in the center) and a bedroom. Whoever thought I would say this but the housekeeping were on point with EVERY LITTLE THING in our room! Our room came out organized and super clean every time they touched up the place. I had to tip her a $20!. . THE CLUB: We came the last weekend Haze Nightclub was open before they shut down for awhile for remodeling. They played awesome music on Saturday night with DJ E Rock as their resident DJ. It is very much due for some remodeling. In comparison of how it first was when it first opened till now, it's not looking so good. BUT I went there both nights of my weekend and had a BLAST!!! The cocktail waitresses there are so pretty and so nice! . . THE STEAKHOUSE RESTAURANT: Will do a separate review for that and it was AMAZING! Would definitely go back!
A for Aria.. . During the first leg of my recent Vegas trip, I spent two nights at Aria, one of the many properties in the City Center Complex.  More specifically, our room was within the Aria Sky Suites section of the hotel.  When I was told that the Sky Suites was a Forbes Five Star and AAA Five Diamond award winner, I must be honest and say I didn't understand the significance of those distinctions.  However, after only a two night stay I can truly see why those awards have been bestowed upon them.  Being a guest at the Sky Suites was truly an experience unrivaled and unmatched by any other hotel I've stayed at.. . As a guest of Aria Sky Suites, your "experience" actually begins upon your arrival at the airport, where the driver of your limo will meet you at your baggage claim.  This service is complimentary and the hotel is accessed via a private entrance/driveway onto the property.  Check-in is also private and is near a lounge area for sky suite guests.. . Walking to our room, the hallway had a very contemporary 70's-esque look to it.  In any case it was quite unique.  Upon arriving at your room, just lightly tap the key card against the door sensor to center.. . Amenities of our suite included:. . *Bar are with mini-fridge, sink, wine bucket, glasses, wine opener, and beer opener as well.. . *Powder room just off the entrance to the suite.. . *Spacious living room area with sofa, chairs, coffee table, wide desk, flat screen television and decent-sized table seating four.. . *Immense and spacious bathroom with closet space, stand up shower, dual vanities and a sizable bathtub positioned in the center.  There's also a dental kit provided with dental floss, toothpaste, and shaving necessities.  . . *Master bedroom is just as spacious as the bathroom.  In fact, it may nearly be the same size.  The bed is extremely comfortable and the pillows exceptionally soft.  There's also a flat screen tv and a small bench/sitting area at the foot of the bed.. . *Push button controls for the blinds/shades for the entire room.  There's also a tablet near the bed that houses the "master controls" for the entire suite.  . . *Turn down service in the evening.  Staff will turn down the bed and provide slippers for guests.  We later discovered all the extra pillows on the bed were placed in the bathroom closet on the top shelf.. . Other amenities during our stay at Sky Suites included:. . *Guest lounge in the lobby is stocked with pastries and fruits in the morning as well as coffee and tea.  Guests are also able to retrieve/help themselves to waters and sodas from their mini-fridges.. . *The aforementioned complimentary limo service/transportation to and from the airport.. . The Aria property has many features/amenities to keep guests entertained and busy during their stay.  Of course there are the requisite casino, bars, night club and lounges.  In addition, restaurants/eateries and shopping opportunities abound as there are various restaurants within the hotel or next door at the Crystals shopping mall.  There is also a tram that connects the Aria with the Crystals Mall and Bellagio Hotel.. . Overall, I think I have nothing to complain about.  Well, except the housekeeping staff ringing the doorbell while I was trying to nap.  However, I must excuse them since they were just stopping by to ask if we needed anything, which I thought was very kind.. . BOTTOM LINE:  A memorable and comfortable stay at Aria Sky Suites.
My staff and I just checked out after a great weekend at the Aria. The service was excellent and always polite. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. There were plenty of amenities and great restaurants nearby and good proximity to the Cosmo and the strip. I was really pleased with the overall experience and extra credit goes to the front desk staff for accommodating us with extra rooms at the last minute. I will definitely be back!
Aria isn't in the upper echelon of hotels on the strip, but it's on the high end of the middle tier.  You can usually find a great value deal to stay here, and it's better than what the typical price point would suggest.. . Some pros: . * The air they pump in makes the whole place smells like vanilla. * Casino floor is good size. * Great center strip location. * Still feels new. . Some cons:. * The remote control interface they have is bizarre.  Want to adjust your lights?  You have to use your TV remote.  Accidentally hit the wrong button?  Every light in your room shuts off, it's now pitch black, and you're trying to figure out how to undo that.  For millennials, not that big of a deal... if you're older than that generation or aren't very tech savvy, your room could drive you crazy.  . * You almost get the sense walking around the City Center complex that they went out of their way to try to waste space.  Their ceilings are massively vaulted; walking to the "next door" Crystals mall will take you 20 minutes; Aria is on The Strip, but it's a hike to even get to Las Vegas Boulevard because the hotel is set back so far.  . . It doesn't have the popularity of the Cosmopolitan, and it doesn't have the luxury of the Wynn/Encore/Bellagio tier.  But, when you factor in the value, size of the casino, and location, it's one of my favorite places to stay on The Strip.  Personally, I'd rate it above the Cosmopolitan, unless you're a Marriott points elitist.
poor waitress service in the casino!! bad!!!. You have to wait sooo long that you can't have fun drinking and gambling. Oh and we got a lame excuse from the waitress boss!! Oh they have a large area!!! Ahhh we come to gamble and have fun so we went to the lift bar and BUY our drinks.  I guess if your not a HIGH ROLLER you don't matter!! Well I'm done with this hotel, will try out the Venetian Hotel check them out!!. . By the way we are hotel guests!!!
I'm on the fence on whether I like Aria or Cosmo better, but I know for sure that I like playing poker in Aria, so it is all the more convenient to stay there.
I love this place. The dealers here are always really nice and the staff overall is very helpful. Very lovely green property.
Aria Hotel is literally one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. I lost my purse and Duff and Wynn worked so hard to help me find it. They literally went above and beyond their call of duty to help out is a guests.
Aria exceeds expectations in every way. From the free in-room WiFi, to the luxurious rooms, and spectacular views, Aria is by far my favorite hotel in Vegas. Not to mention, they have the most comfortable bed I have ever had the pleasure of sleeping in. The buffet was excellent and affordable, with impeccable service all around. We were on the 29th floor and had an amazing view of the strip. My only gripe was that the maid mistakenly took one of our robes with the towels, but it was replaced promptly with no issues. The spa was also affordable, at $30/person per day. That includes the three (clothing optional) hot tubs, eucalyptus steam room, and cedar sauna. Also included was a co-ed outdoor pool, salt room, and hot stone beds. The locker rooms were fabulous, with everything you need for showering, shaving, hair styling, etc. There was even a flat iron and complimentary razors, hair brushes, and makeup remover, among other things.. . Another plus is the location. This is one of the few hotels that has easy access to practically any other spot on the strip. The free tram is very useful, as is the monorail which is only 5-min on foot.. . While we didn't hit it big in the casino, we did get plenty of few drinks from the waitstaff, which came by every fifteen minutes or so. . . This will definitely be my go-to hotel when we return to Vegas!
Many other options for the price. We come to Las Vegas about 3x a year and use to like staying here, but the quality and service has gone down. This last visit, we noticed all the wood was scraped up, walls had scratches and marks all over the place. The light in the closet was out and the tv service was out...NO TV. None. Nada. . I called the front desk and the woman who answered was pretty rude about it saying they've been working on it all day. I'm sure I'm the bigillionth person to call about it, but you don't need to be rude to me when I'm not rude to you. . It just seems the rooms could use a little TLC- I mean a wood pen could fix all the scratches and it's not expensive. Not sure what the previous reviewers mean by "free wifi" because it's only free for 2 hours so I don't know about you, but 2 hours isn't much of anything to me.  I'd actually prefer you didn't tease me with 2 free hours. Kinda lame. . Anyway, in summary, use to be nice, but like a lot of other hotels, they fell into a pit. Stay at Cosmo, Wynn, encore, Venetian etc.
1 star for the poor customer service! We stayed at the Aria casino just about 2 weeks ago and while leaving the casino i noticed that there was a damage to my car. We decided to go to the the security and file the report and they told us that they'll contact us back within a few business days. Today, I called to follow up on my case since apparently the person who handled my case never contacted me within the "few business days" as I was told and I've learned that my case has been CLOSED! what? closed? since when? The person that was on the phone also stated that Mr. El has made an attempt to contact me on 11/4 (according to their notes), but this is BS because i never received any call nor any voice message. AFter filing the report, we had this gut instinct that we weren't going to win the case anyway, but as a person who walked out with a damage car would like to get some sort of closure from the hotel. This is very unprofessional and Aria that was my very first stay and will be also the last stay with you guys.
Clean, but the service is poor and unapologetic, and the rooms are overly complicated with technology and the equipment faulty.. . During my stay, the TV has gone dark on the entire hotel for several hours, my room control system has inexplicably rebooted itself several times, and my curtains refuse to close!. . I'm trying to get some sleep, but the electronics refuse to function and there is no manual override for me to simply slide the curtains to a close!. . To make matters worse, the "IT department", who hold the power to my curtains and sleep, give me no ETA as there are several other callers with similar issues ahead of me!!  Unbelievable!. . Stay at the Wynn, Aria and most other MGM properties are riddled with unpleasantries.
Really nice hotel. Liked tap to unlock room key system (does it support using a smartphone yet?). Rooms are clean and modern. Enjoyed the room automation with the blinds and lights, though the controls could be more intuitive. 3 of the 4 reading lights over the beds didn't turn on. Plenty of open floor space to stretch out, literally. Room safe next to bed is a good location. Plenty of drawer and closet space at the entrance of the room, in front of the bathroom. Makes sense. . . Nice big tub with separate shower. Nice touch to have frosted glass separate the toilet from the rest of the bathroom. Happy with the included bath wash, shampoo, conditioner, all in addition to bar soap for counter in bathroom. Plenty of towels that didn't seem worn out. . . Watch out for the $28/day ($25 + $3 tax) resort fee. They say they charge this mandatory fee plus tax because the state of Nevada mandates it. They also say they charge the fee to keep from having to nickel and dime us. Yet, they also charge $30 more per day for 2 queen beds instead of 1 king bed. I've never been charged extra for 2 queens over 1 king. Tried to tell them I didn't use any of the amenities included with resort fee, but still got dinged. . . Long hallways in the room areas feel like they should have people movers built-in or provide Segways, especially if your room is towards the end. Casino areas are typical of Vegas. Smoke in your clothes still comes standard. The dessert place (Jean something) is quite good. The Aria Cafe food is decent and doesn't feel cramped. Aria buffet is standard for Vegas. Appreciated the person only allowing hotel guests with keys up to room floors. Seems like they do some blocking of cellular data connections in certain areas (i.e. Casino). . . Overall, a good hotel, by Vegas standards. Just watch out for the unnecessary fees.
This is my second time staying at the aria. The first time was shortly after it was built. I do have to say that I found the room to be dusty and not cleaned properly and that was upon check-in. The other thing that drives me crazy but the Aria is that they have do not have enough lighting in the rooms.  I asked for additional lighting and they brought some bulbs they were actually higher wattage they helped a little bit but still it was difficult to see to get ready to go out with the room so dark. The other amenities such as the casino the spa and the pool and restaurants were all good
I should preface this by saying I'm a bit of a hotel snob. Maybe not "snob", but due to work I've honestly spent multiple years of my life living in hotels, which is more than most people. I've had great stays at inexpensive places because they keep things clean and care about their guests, and I've had lousy stays at expensive places because they don't do these things. Aria falls somewhere in between.. . Actually no, Aria falls on the lower end of the spectrum.. . The non-hotel parts are great. The restaurants are nice and overpriced as expected, the casino is lovely, the shops are overpriced as expected, etc. If I didn't actually stay there, I probably would have given it 4 stars.. . However, the room quality was lousy. First off, there was a big section of peeling wallpaper in the corridor leading to my room. Really? Tape or glue would solve that until it could be properly fixed. I'm shocked that a hotel would allow that to be in the guests' sight, especially when it tries to market itself as luxurious.. . The room itself was "meh" at best. The bedside tablet to control the room is such a gimmicky joke, and might have been slightly impressive 12 years ago. It's a slow, laggy system with a lousy user interface, and it's completely asinine to use something such as this for simple functions such as changing the channel on the TV or turning the lights on or off. Unfortunately I was stuck using it to change the TV channels because the remote was dead. Speaking of dead, so was the minibar. It was maybe a few degrees below room temperature at the most. If you're going to use convenience to tempt me with soda, sparkling water, and various alcohols at 500% of retail, they at least need to be nice and cold.. . I ordered room service exactly once and the food was absolutely lousy. I would have thought they could manage a decent bowl of ramen (there are world-class ramen houses literally within a few miles of this hotel, so people around here should know what it's supposed to taste like) and it was beyond disappointing.. . The kicker is that my opinions are this low when it didn't cost me a dime. Corporate expense account for the lot of it. Had I been actually paying to stay here, I would have checked out within a couple hours of check-in. I can literally say it's barely worth staying here for free. It seems like if you want to drop the cash for one of their upper level suites you can have a great experience, but after this initial experience I'm not going to give them the chance when I come back for pleasure instead of business.. . To be fair, the Aria did stand out for me in one area, and one area alone: the staff. Everyone I interacted with, from the front desk to the waitstaff to housekeeping to the valets, concierge, casino staff, convention area staff, etc. were all pleasant and professional. The staff are the only reason why this place gets a generous two stars instead of one.
Beautiful Corner Suite we reserved. Awesome professional customer service. Very friendly and reasonable pricing.
We always stay at Aria. The service and standards keep us coming back. Our last trip was by far the best - the hotel is a few years old now and still has that new feel. Service has only gotten better with time as it seems they have all the kinks worked out by now. Aria is by far my favorite hotel in Vegas!
Amazing customer service. Very clean. Their buffet is good and is in the vegas top ten list of good buffets. Idk i just love this place
I really like the Aria - brand new and very high end - get ready for more of a high-rollers feel in the casino a lot of the machines and table games in here seem to have a higher minimum, you have to search a bit for the cheaper machines and table games . . Over all a nice ambiance - definitely a younger more hip crowd, a bit of a smaller sports book. and a good sized casino overall that is pretty easy to navigate - quick tip stay next door at the Monte Carlo where it is a bit cheaper of a room to just crash in and go to the Aria for other experiences to save some money
Rude staff. The rooms are nice, room service food was delicious but takes about 45 mins to come to your room. We broke glass in our room and left to go to an event expecting it to be cleaned, nobody cleaned the glass and when we came bak the room was dark my boyfriend cut his foot deeply. We ended up in the hospital, when we came back from the hospital, broken glass was still everywhere on the floor along with blood and this is after the hotel staff already know about the incident. . We went to javier's at aria and we weren't happy with a dish. They didn't want to take it off the bill and the manager called aria's security. They were rude and told us they will call the cops on us if we don't pay. I understand if they choose not to do anything about a customer satisfaction, but bringing up the fact that they wanna call the cops on their own hotel resident over not being happy with their food can totally ruin one's trip. It was unprofessional.They treated us like we were some peasants. We were paying so much for the room and room service and everything else to have a nice trip. But this one really ruined everything.. At the end we went to management and complained and they said they cant do anything about it and acted all careless. They really didn't care and i am not exaggerating. This is true story word by word. . Thank you
