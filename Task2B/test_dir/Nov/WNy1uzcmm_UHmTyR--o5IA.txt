This is our families newest favorite.  Love the pastys!  We try a new flavor every visit.  The beer menu is awesome too!  3 valley locations.  Find one!!
Although the pork pasty and mushroom+ soup were delish, the Indian spiced chicken salad was lacking.  Fast service but the loud planes, irritating patio music, along with the bothersome flies, had us scurrying along.  This was not our first time at The Cornish Pasty.  We now prefer the Guadalupe location.  Homemade soups, brews, and pasties are quite good.
First off, let me say that I adore this place. The vibe is excellent, the food is to die for, and the dim candlelit lighting just makes for the perfect ambiance. It's so... comfortable in there, but in the best way. Now, my husband isn't the biggest fan. His complaints are that the benches are hard and uncomfortable and he doesn't like that you sit with others, but hey, you win some you lose some, and I think Cornish Pasty is winning! (say that like Charlie Sheen and it makes it 10x better)
i am so pissed at my friends, they always recommended this place but they didn't tell me they pretty much serve nothing but bomb ass homemade hot pockets. Amazing beer selection, kind of dark inside but I like it that way. Got the Shepard's Pie Pasty, it was absolutely amazing, especially with their red wine gravy.
I was visiting Phoenix and Yelped a few places to try. My friend and I decided to go to Cornish Pasty in Tempe. It was dark and open seating, definitely had a pub vibe inside. We decided to sit outside at the patio to enjoy the Fall weather. . . I got the Oggie and my friend got Shepard's pie with a side Oven Chips - added the garlic and jalepenos. I love anything pie crust and these pasties definitely hit the spot.  The minced lamb from the Shepard's pie was  cooked perfectly and not too gamey. The Oggie was a classic and a comfort food. Oven chips were like french fries cooked with minced garlic and jalepenos that weren't spicy at all. I found out there's a location in Vegas and will definitely have to visit there to try the other pasties.
Cornish is great and one of my top go-tos!  It is such a great concept and culture for a restaurant.  There are several locations in the valley and they all have a slightly different vibe with a laid back foundation. It's definitely a hipster crowd but not in a way that will make you sick to your stomach if you're not so hipster.  The tables are mostly long picnic table style which makes the scene effortlessly chill.. . The menu concept is simple yet eclectic.  It's a menu full of pasties with so many variations for every taste bud out there.  There's the classic British ones and also some fun twists on Italian, Greek and Mexican flavors.  My favorite part of the menu is that they have a whole selection of pasties that are meatless and vegan.  They use meat substitute that tastes delicious!  It's a really nice treat for any vegetarians or vegans out there who are sick of eating salads at every restaurant.  . . I recommend visiting Cornish often and with all of your favorite people in life!  It won't let you down as long as your embrace it for what it is - inexpensive and chill
Not only are the pasties frickin amazing,  but the customer service is over the top. The owner saw us browsing through & asked if we've ever been there. Told him no & he just went at, explaining & answering whatever question we had. I can't remember what beer I got because I said surprise me, but lord have mercy, what a delicious ipa. & I know I should try other pasties, but that Cajun one has me hooked! Definitely will be back.
Guys, you need to do something about your takeout. Or stop doing it. The soggy undercooked pasties are just horrible. I write this from a 3 time experience.. . I dined in over a hundred times. Foods pretty decent at the location. Great selection of beers. I got to applaud you guys for that. . . ALso, your service isnt great ! and you don't have enough staff to take orders and serve them.  . . I would do more take outs if you could make an online ordering system. Over the phone, they just cant seem to hear with all the noise. And did i say you are understaffed.
So we came here for a nice meal. We had a party of about 13 people. We got in in a reasonable time considering there is no reservation.  However one of the people that ordered food in our group never received it.  Everyone was finished before they even acknowledged this.  It was handled very unprofessional. Because of this I will not be back.
Really great comfort food!  I love the royale with cheese and the chicken pot pie.  They have a huge patio and make good drinks.
Two word review. Food poisoning.  Not a clean place and proof you can put bad meat in a pie and sell it to consumers.
Every time I go to Cornish i feel like I'm in Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. It is very "hipster" , but in an awesome way. Everyone is super friendly and the food consists of a calzone type pastry with various different options for filling. I haven't had something I didn't like, though my favorite is the italian.
Very filling and tasty with lots of pasty choices. The beer choices are good and service was good too. Would definitely return.
My BF and I have been wanting to check this place out for awhile cause so many people talk about how awesome it is. I'm cheap so spending $9+ on an entree with no sides seemed like it wouldn't be worth it - boy was I wrong. . We did have some difficulty trying to find the front door as its not right off the main road (Hardy) you have to go the parking lot and there you see a door with the business name and hours, which still didn't look like the right door. We walked in and felt like we came in a side door or something but a friendly gal said we could seat ourselves. . The place was pretty dark and looked like it had been there awhile which didn't bother us. We picked a two-top table which seemed like it was on a stage, we didn't want to take up the large community style (looking) tables.. We were promptly greeted by a sweet gal named Casey. She made us feel comfortable as we explained we hadn't been there before. My bf ordered a tea and they had three options (Hibiscus, black and green) he choose the green and said he liked it. I wanted an Odell Isolation but they said they ran out so I went with a Union Jack IPA (az local) and was pleasantly surprised by the price when we received our check that it was only $4, awesome deal! . I normally eat vegan so I asked about the vegan pastie specials (two choices daily) They had quite a few vegan options on the menu (like 10) but all of them included a fake meat (Quorn brand) and I am not a fan of vegan food trying to be like "normal" food, just wanted veggies and nothing fake. She said one special was a "Philly cheese steak style" and the other was a spinach artichoke which sounded like what I wanted. My BF ordered the chicken pot pie one cause he knew that would be hard to mess up. He really enjoyed his, its what he was expecting - perfect and legit. . Mine arrived and I noticed mine looked different which I expected. I also noticed it had Daiya cheese on it which I wasn't expecting, I wish the server would have mentioned that cause I am not really a fan. To me Daiya has such a strong distinct flavor that it usually takes over whatever its on or in. This was no exception but I felt Like this time it was at least semi balanced where it didn't totally take it over but it was definitely a predominate taste. I know lots of vegans like that cheese but I'm a weirdo and would rather forgo fake cheese. . His crust was tasty since it had real butter and mine was a bit drier but still surprisingly good, even the boyfriend was stealing some from my plate.. Next time I'm just gonna get a non vegan one so I can get the full experience, I really wanted to try a curry one (with no fake meat).. Overall awesome experience and when u are there you feel like you are in a place of history, even if you are not - I am not sure ;)
So far not so good. I had to go through 4 different beers to find one they weren't out of. We ordered a scotch egg as an appy...nope, out of that too. So we ordered the Cornish meatballs...and strike 3. I hope when I get my food it at least tastes when I get it.
Literally, anything your warm heart desires...into a pasty. Great comfort food and big enough to take the other half home for later. Ordered a veggie rosemary chicken and the hubby had a philly cheesesteak. They have an indoor restaurant, the grunge bar, and an outdoor patio with heaters. Waitresses were very friendly and fast. Highly recommend. Will come back to try other different pasties when in Phoenix!
Amazing food , the chicken pot pie is nothing to write home about . But the tomato soup is amazing especially with the bread.
First time here and I got the PB&J and what a surprise! It came with a side of ice cream which left me confused. After tasting the great Pasty, I understood the ice cream was there to compliment the dish. Really shows forethought to the level at which this place thinks through each dish. Decor is cool too. Very happy, come try it, ill be back!!
Great food, I have tried many things on the menu and The Pilgrim is one of my favs.  I ordered The Royal once at the one on Dobson.  Wasn't much of a fan of that on.  Think I prefer the taste of a burger on a bun rather than in a pasty.  Really like the space and a great looking bar, it has a dark feeling which I think is great.
I have to be honest, when I walked in I had no idea what to expect. It was dark and very subdue. The waitress was very friendly and took our order promptly. Once your eyes adjusts to the darkness its was not bad at all. The food arrived quickly and was nice and fresh.. .  I ordered the "Bangers and Mash" and my wife ordered the "Shepherds Pie". We ended up splitting them so we could both try half of the other. I have to say it was really really good. The crust in which the "pies" are baked in are flaky and tasty. . . I slightly preferred the "Bangers and Mash" (Homemade pork with sage sausage, red wine gravy, grilled onions, mashed potatoes, & an extra side of gravy.) over the "Shepherd's Pie" (Ground minted lamb or seasoned ground beef, with peas & carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes, and cheddar. With a side of red wine gravy) But she got it with the ground beef instead of the minted lamb so that might have made a difference.
A great, very small place with big flavorful portions.  I usually get the cajun (comes with a pretty spicy chipotle sauce) that I can only finish a half of.  Service is great, people are very friendly.

We love Cornish and have been many times. I have never gone wrong with anything on the menu. Im always left full and satisfied with a pasty. They have a great atmosphere and large beer and drink selection. Staff has always been friendly and helpful.
The decor in this place is dark, warm and comfortable, which suits the food and drink excellently; the place has expanded since it first opened, buying the space next door and knocking out the walls. The original tiny location is still the main entrance point, with the kitchen and bar now located right in the middle of the establishment.. . The layout's a little confusing until you've been here a few times, but there's nothing confusing about the food-- it's excellent. I'll just read off the stuff on the menu that I've tried and liked: Under "Signature Pasties", there's the Oggie (steak/potato/onion/rutabaga), the Bangers and Mash, the Meat and Cheese (sausage, Cheddar, and Swiss), the Shepherd's Pie, and the Chicken Alfredo (with potatoes instead of pasta). Under "Premium Pasties", there's the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Pesto Chicken. As for the soups, I recommend the cream of leek, potato and Stilton -- it goes remarkably well with most of the entrees, and served with fresh bread and butter it's almost good enough to make a meal on its own. The sides include authentic English-style chips-- with optional garlic or jalapeno-- and there's a wide selection of desserts, all of which are worth saving room for. There's a similarly wide selection of beers and other beverages, including Guinness AND Strongbow Cider on draft. And all of this is available at a price that won't drain the life out of your bank account.. . Just to sum up my opinion of the place, I can safely say that I have NEVER had a bad dining experience at the Cornish Pasty Co. The service is always great, the food and drink are always great, and the prices are pretty damned good as well.
