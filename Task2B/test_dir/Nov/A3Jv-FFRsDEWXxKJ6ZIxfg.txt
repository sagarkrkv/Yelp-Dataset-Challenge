Disappointing considering this guy yells at people for sub par food!  We honestly just stopped for drinks and figured this was a safe bet-place looked cool and there were empty spots in front, perfect for people watching.  I ordered a grey hound and my friend ordered a mojito.  While waiting we realized we could have taken advantage of the happy hour menu which was never mentioned by our server.  (Would have been nice to know.)  After waiting much too long our drinks arrived but we were certain the mojito was wrong-it was in a clear glass, no fresh mint to speak of.  My friend had a sip and she said it tasted like the pre-mixed drinks you can buy in the grocery store in a can.  That is where I suspected my greyhound came from as well judging by the taste-it was horrible.  But if you are going to charge $14 (?) for a mojito at least fake it by throwing in a spring of fresh mint...but mAybe that was too much work.  So, we ordered from the happy hour menu next thinking this was clearly not a mixed drink place-we should have paid attention to the keg-decor and impressive beer offering.  I happen to love IPAs and was excited to see Dog Fish Head on tap...but no...it was out.  It was only 4:00 or so!!  Okay, so I ordered  Stone IPA, also. Rey nice.  Strike two... "Sorry-we are also out of that."  So the only other IPA was Lagunitas which I like.  At $5 (happy hour) it was a deal including the $5 nachos-over the top fattening but good.  I can't believe a restaurant of this caliber had the audacity to serve those so called cocktails we started with-they should be ashamed of themselves!
Being a longtime fan of Gordon Ramsey, I must admit that my expectations for this Pub were pretty high.. . Our server was very friendly and pretty good. We started off with the Pretzel Appetizer - not any better than any other pretzel appetizer you could get at any sit-down restaurant. We then ordered the scallops, mashed potatoes and lobster mac & cheese.. . Scallops - they were cooked decently, but surprised by how tasteless and bland they were. Mashed Potatoes - Very tasty and very lumpy, but in a charming way. Lobster Mac & Cheese - Not as tasty as I was hoping. Was even more disappointed when I CHOKED ON PIECES OF LOBSTER SHELL in my food.. . I did notify the server about the shells who then spoke with one of her bosses not more than 5 feet from me who said they didn't shuck the lobster from the shell, but that it comes pre-done. Now there are 2 things that really bother me about this situation: 1) I paid $27 for Lobster Mac & Cheese and it appears that quality is not a priority for this restaurant. 2) The manager didn't even take the time to come and apologize to me. I wasn't expecting this to be comp'd, but an apology for serving me lobster shells in a dish that is supposed to be void of it I think merits at least an apology.
Went last night for our daughters 23rd Bday, for her 21st we went to Steak at the Paris...she loves to go to his restaurants because they share the Birthday!. Food was amazing; seasoning was perfect & very "tasty".  We all agreed we were just as satisfied in the Pub as we couldn't get into Steak.. We will definitely be back!. Had Lobster Roll, Ceasar salad, Calamari, Short Ribs, Shepards Pie & Steak...OMG. Then they surprised her with a candle dessert...on them!
Gordon, I had high expectations. Took a bit for the bartenders to realize I was new and have not been helped. Once noticed I ordered a bloody marry and that was fantastic. I then ordered a 1/2dz wings and a medium burger with fries. I was expecting u wings to come first since they were an app but when they came the burger was served at the same time.... . I started with the wings. The second one I bit into was raw. yuck! What a turn offfffff. They got sent back and they brought me new ones but after biting into raw chicken in the first set I couldn't think about eating them the second time around. Didn't even really want to eat my burger after that. My burger was suppose to medium but it came out medium rare and the bun was soggy but at this point I just sucked it up and just ate it. I had to ask for ketchup. When it was brought to me I thought it was cocktail sauce but was informed by the bartender that was how they made their ketchup.. . Over all I give you two stars for the fact that your bloody Mary's are the bomb and I appreciated the managers checking in on me. Not charging me for the wings and hooking me up with a second drink. I've been in the restaurant business for 16yrs and I know shit happens, but when both items I order come out under cooked and the guy next to me is complaining about his scallops being under cooked as well You need to step it up in your kitchen and hold up to your name. . . Forgot to mention the menu is over priced. Your paying to be sitting in Gordon Ramsey's restaurant in Caesars palace more then the quality of food and service. $35 for a burger and bloody marry. Plus tip.
This review is only for the Sticky Toffee Pudding. . . Come here for the Sticky Toffee Pudding!. . What is Sticky Toffee Pudding?. . It is Sticky, Toffee and Pudding... . . Ok, really, it is a mini baked Date cake, drizzled in warm toffee/caramel sauce and served with vanilla ice cream.   If you like the warm chocolate cakes out there, you would enjoy this too. . . If you are not having dinner, and you just want dessert, they can serve you at the bar. Bartenders are nice, and sometimes you hear interesting conversations from the people at the bar.
Great foot, drinks and service by Christopher for lunch today.  We stopped in for a lunch bite and casino people watching and were not disappointed in the least.  I had the trio min-pie sampler and can't decide which is my favorite as all were yummy.  My husband had the fish and chips very well seasoned, nicely fried, not greasy and very flavorable.  The best part was our side, english peas with bacon and onions that melted in your mouth...well done and we will be back the next time we come to Vegas!
Okay if you were to ask my husband you'd probably get a rave review. I got banggers and mash which came with various flavors of banggers and I didn't care for that one of them was pretty gross, my daughter wouldn't even eat it and she's not picky at all when it comes to that type of food normally. My potatoes were good so I ate those, I also had some little sausage appetizer that wasn't great either. My husband liked his lobster roll and I'll admit his steak was much better then my food. We did get the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was really good. So Id' get that again. Over all I was disappointed and would skip this place to try other foods Vegas has to offer. It was also pretty loud and we had so many people bringing food or drinks I'm not even sure who our server was. It was kind of late and we were too hungry to wait for Creaser's buffet. I'd wait next time.
Though there were some really great things about Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill in Caesar's Palace, I left feeling like something was missing.  This is the second Gordon Ramsay restaurant I've been to, the other one was in London and wasn't the best experience.  The atmosphere at this pub was nice... lots of TVs and the room was huge.  We sat in the bar area and had to wait quite awhile for service and our food.  I also found what the waitresses were wearing to be a bit much... but to each their own.. . As far as the food goes, I tried the pretzels, pub nachos, sliders, and sticky toffee pudding.  The pretzels were amazing, especially the cheese sauce they were served with.  I only wish this has been a bigger portion.  The nachos were good... loved the kettle chips and sauce, but there were WAY too many jalapenos - jeez does anyone like them that much?  The sliders were standard... way over cooked.  As others have said the sticky toffee pudding is delicious... this is a MUST have at this restaurant.. . All in all, I would go back and try some different things.  They do have some happy hour specials, which is nice... especially in Vegas.
Stopped in for a couple drinks and bar snacks before seeing Absinthe. Drinks and snacks were good and they have a pretty decent variety of beers, but they definitely have the Vegas and Gordon Ramsay price tag. Cool spot though and good people watching if you're sitting in the area open to the casino. I had the sliders and a my husband had the kettle chip nachos - sliders were good but the nachos won. Worth I stop if you're looking for a quick bite in Caesar's, but not a place I would make a special trip to visit.
Food was good staff is friendly but I think pricing is way to high for pub food.
I had the calamari for the appetizer it was very well designed with two dipping sauces. I had the fish and chips for my entree and it was very crispy and very moist in the inside. Then I have the sticky toffee pudding with ice cream and caramel sauce and it was also moist and very good
i got the sheperds pie, which i thought it was pretty good, had lots of meat in it. But the best part was the sticky toffee pudding! OMG delicious, best dessert ever!
I've been looking forward to eating here for literally months. I browsed the menu online and arrived expecting to be quite happy. Unfortunately, the best I can report is that I left full. . . Our flight was delayed, causing my spouse and I to be about 30 minutes late for our reservation. Not a problem- they were able to seat us after a 10 minute wait. Unfortunately, after that we kept waiting. It took another 15 minutes to get water. 10 more minutes after that before our waitress arrived to take drink orders. We ended up placing our meal order at the same time, just to cut down on the delays.. . As a starter, my son and I shared an order of the Warm Pretzels....which arrived stale and significantly less than warm. The accompanying cheese sauce was glorified velveeta. My entree, the Steak & Ale Pie was okay. The description said the pie contained "root vegetables" so I'd been eagerly anticipating a pie rich with steak, potatoes, parsnips, turnips...all those lovely British veg. But no...I got a basic stewed beef with a couple of sad little carrot bits, topped by a crust that left my mouth coated in lard/shortening film. . . My spouse and son both ordered burgers and raved about them...but they both agreed that the fries reminded them of Burger King. Not what an English pub should aspire to emulate.. . Overall? Horribly overpriced (we paid over $100 for 3 entrees, 2 apps and 3 sodas) mediocre food. Cannot recommend.
I didn't enjoy much of the food here. This place is huge, and quite empty. Regardless, we sat down because I love Ramsay. . . Maybe because I'm not a burger fan to start with, but the lamb burger our waitress recommended to me was very lamby(heavy lamb smell) with a bunch of blue cheese which was making the whole burger even heavier. . . The crab cake(?) I forgot the original name, but this crab thing was simply imitation crab in an oily bun... Disappointed . . Also,we ordered the deviled eggs since I saw reviews on yelp: the taste was quite blunt. Nothing special and I don't really recommend. . . The only highlight was the fries and sticky tofu pudding. . . I would stay away from this place if you are a Ramsay fan, and go to the Ramsay steak house.
One of my favourite spots in Vegas! This is a great stop for delicious food that won't break the bank. I admit I first visited because of Gordon Ramsay (who wouldn't? :), but the food is tasty! I've had pub appetizers one visit, and then the salmon for dinner on another - no disappointment here. If you're at a conference at Caesars (like I was), definitely add this in to your lunch repertoire!
Ordered the filet for dinner and got the weirdest thing I've ever seen that I should have taken a photo of :-(. I ordered it medium rare...it came not only medium but the "filet" was cut in half and cooked on both sides before.  I complained and the waiter said that really was a filet (eh?  weirdest one I've seen and I don't think it's good practice to cut it in half before cooking it).. The one they replaced it with was indeed a filet and cooked properly.  The sides were terrible.  I don't know why Gordon Ramsey put his name on this...if this were on any of his shows, he'd ream out everyone in the kitchen and the wait staff for what happened :-P
I would say the food was very good. On par with one of my fave pub places in LV - Todd English's at Aria -- and the thing that made it 5 stars was service.  Ate at the bar.  Very friendly but not overbearing staff and quick food.  Though quick the shrimp cocktail was crisp and cold and just enough bite in the sauce and the steak was done perfectly.  The fingerling potatoes were a welcome small side to the good size steak.  Fed recommend if you are at Caesars.
Came here with a group of 7, . made reservations earlier in the day,. The service was on point,. Food arrived in a quick manor and was delicious!. Would definitely come back!
Had an amazing meal. Adam Rogers was our server and he made the night memorable for my family.  Superior service, delicious food and met executive chef Scott!  an expensive restaurant, but woth every penny.  . . Absolute must haves are the fillet and the sticky toffee!
Great fish and chips. Might be the best in town. Loved the build your own deviled eggs and was sad to hear they had redone the recipe because now they are just ok. Could add more beers since they claim to be a pub however their cocktails are made with love and homemade mix. The Bloody Mary was very good. Bartenders would benefit from shirts in the next size up but are engaging and helpful with menu advise.
Convenient spot. Hubby had BLT and maple flavor of bacon over powered the sandwich. I had the wedge salad: blue cheese, tomato, onion, egg, bacon dressing. Maple flavor complemented the salad. Good service.
walked in here expecting more since it was a Gordon Ramsey spot... was disappointed none the less.  The only thing I like was the place setting and silverware design.  Beyond that was all down hill.. . . I got the beer braised rib with creamy barry risotto.. the risotto was the only decent part of this dish... other friends in my group got salads, burgers, and steak but no one seemed happily satisfied with any of their dishes.  Just Pricey Pub Food with no flair or special touches.
The spotted dick served here is great, along with the horseradish and garlic ketchup. I usually don't put a lot of stock into the ketchup, but this unique blend was phenomenal.
This is the second time here and the bar service is impersonal, little eye contact and minimal effort. Unfortunately,we will not be returning.
I was a little disappointed.  The food was good, but overpriced and the service was slow.
Ordered beef burger to go and was excellent. I do recommend this restaurant for quick order.
Let me begin by pointing out we had lunch at GRP&G. A dinner experience is most likely different. The atmosphere definitively rings pub. Kegs are used in lieu of wall separations and the table we were seated at was really "homey" This was my first Ramsey experience so I was anxious to see if his establishments could hold up to the cartoon scrutiny he puts the contestants through on his over wrought Hell's Kitchen show. Are his restaurants held to the same standard? I would have to say GRP&G is up to snuff. The menu is interesting but smallish even for a lunch but it certainly does not lack variety. Chicken pot pie and a beef pot pie are available as well as the expected Shepard's pie. .We saw several burgers being served and they were huge! Nice touch adding beer suggestions with each dish. I did not partake but thought the beer pairing idea was genius. We choose to start with a Scotch Egg that was delightful but the chipotle and mustard sauce took took it to another level, We also tried the shrimp cocktail that was ....a shrimp cocktail...Not bad,  just not special. I tried the braised beef rib and it was very good.It was served over a risotto (and no...I heard no screaming coming from the kitchen) that was nice. Desert however went to a new level of decadence.  A brownie, topped with cheesecake, topped with Rocky Road ice cream, covered in chocolate and to add to the party a magnificent caramel sauce on the side. No fellow Yelpers, this is not Gordon Ramsey light! Service was ...interesting. Good, fast, ..really spot on with the timing ....but...well..leave it to say our server was ....interesting. I've seen a few trash reviews here complaining about 12 dollar fish and chips? Come on ...it's a celebrity chef venue inside Caesar's Palace!  Were you looking for a Denny's? All in all a pretty nice experience and I would try dinner next time. ...If you do get the same sever we got ...and you will know if you do ...Let me know if the word interesting applies!
Were I writing this solely based on the food, I would go 4 stars, but the service and high cost to food ratio knock it down to 3. . . We were seated right away, but in requesting that we did not get one of the "high" bar style tables we saw at the entrance, were shown instead to an oversize "booth" consisting of a table and two large but lightweight movable couches. This proved to be somewhat uncomfortable, I felt like I was hunching over my food the entire meal as the table was too low for the level of the couches and the couches better suited for lounging than eating. All I could think was, if I wanted to eat dinner at my couch in front of my TV, I would do so. Might be fun with a larger group but it was not very intimate for 2. . . So lets get to the food, we had the calamari appetizer which was light, perfectly fried and tasty, and also a decent size portion as well. The accompanying sauces were the standard cocktail and aioli, uninventive but appreciated. We both decided on the lamb burger, which was enormous. If anything the meat to bun ratio here is unbalanced, the patty could be downsized a little bit or bun upsized without losing anything, the meat overwhelmed the remaining ingredients on the burger to the point you felt like you were eating just a big pile of patty. It was a very good lamb burger nonetheless.  Meanwhile, the accompanying fries were nothing to write home about, and like the fried squid, they also came in a suitably large portion. . . The service was surprisingly poor, my iced tea glass remained empty at one point for more than 10 minutes during our meal, and we were not attended to promptly when sitting down. I suppose by American standards the service was "normal" and Europeans would find it too fast a pace. . . Lastly, the place was quite expensive, you do indeed pay for the name in addition to the food. Two burgers, an appetizer and two sodas cost us $85 with tip. I was expecting this, but its worth noting nonetheless.
