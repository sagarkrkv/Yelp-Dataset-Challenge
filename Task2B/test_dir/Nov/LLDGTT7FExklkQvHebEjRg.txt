We went to Joe's on a very rare day that my husband and I were off on the same day; while the kids still had school. After walking through the forum shops at Ceasar's we decided on Joe's. The wait to be seated was about 10 mins...that was for a tall table in the bar area, not the outer patio seating which was packed with lunch customers. We expected the wait as all the reviews warned of how busy the restaurant usually is. . . Once seated, we were greeted immediately and our drink orders were taken. I had the amazing Bloody Mary while my husband had a Stella. Everything came in a timely manner...my Bloody Mary had a gigantic shrimp in it which was fantastic. The waitress then took our order and was very helpful in explaining the menu items and seasonal pricing. My hubby decided on the Fishermans Platter (he chose grilled, you can also get fried) while I had to have the signature crab claws. We both also ordered the side ceasar salad and a cup of lobster bisque.. . The ceasar salad was good. Not amazing or anything but a well put together well dressed salad. Now, the lobster bisque was EPIC. Velvety and creamy...my hubby and I were licking our spoons and wanting more. I definitely recommend the lobster bisque to anyone (besides those with shellfish allergies of course). The main courses then came out and they were nicely presented, just simple seafood and simple condiments. My husbands seafood platter was fresh, light, and delicious. The stand out star being the scallops which were super sweet and grilled perfectly. My crab claws we're delicious...definitely a bit of work to get to the meat but well worth it. I wasn't a big fan of their mustard sauce they serve with the claws, so I requested lemons and clarified butter. No issues. All in all in was a delightful lunch that I would definitely do again.
Had an amazing meal at Joe's last night. The rib eye was cooked  perfectly and the side dishes of potato, broccolini, and cauliflower were delicious. Our server was Hope and she was fantastic. A+ for service in addition to her knowledge of the menu and our wine pairing. We will be back on our next trip to Vegas!
Don't ever order the Dover Sole.  Joe's has been upselling that crap for years.  The reason why the waiters always recommend it is because Dover Sole is $6 per pound, and it represents their highest profit margin, selling it for $45 per plate.  Do yourself a favor and order a truly expensive piece of fish, crab, or steak.  Also don't ever order Stone Crab when it's not stone crab season !  If it's not stone crab season, then you'll enjoy frozen crap.  Stone crab season is between 15 OCT - 15 MAY.
What else can I say abt Joe's, except that it's the best???  Do check tho..before you go.. If the crabs are not in season, they have to use frozen ones.. either way.. it's perfect!!  I went to Joe's in Miami for the first time.. n 2nd time in Las vegas.. I wish they open one in Los Angeles~ I would go at least once a month!!! Love!
Excellent! Love this place will return next time I'm in Vegas! I sat outside and I loved the ambiance. Service was excellent! Everything your looking for in a Vegas meal!
Great food and amazing service!!!  We dined here for my husband's birthday.  Hope was our server and she was wonderful!  She was very helpful and pleasant and made our first dining experience at Joe's spectacular!. . All of our food was delicious and well worth the money.  The stone crab was very fresh and tasty.  I had the Dover sole that was well worth the $48.. . Make sure you have the Havana Dream for dessert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  YUMMY!~!!!!. . We will definitely return to Joe's again!  . . Ask for Hope, she's great!
FYI: STONE CRAB SEASON IS OCTOBER TO MAY. . Just so that there is no confusion for people coming in the off months. Yes this place is a Joe's but it's NOT Joe's Stone Crab in Miami. They are technically not the same restaurant, according to our lovely, and very knowledgeable, waitress. . . Either way, it may seem weird to be a place with stone crab in the name and then not have it sometimes. Stone crabs are seasonal though so...the more you know. I don't think this place merits low ratings just because people are not aware of this fact.. . Luckily we came right at the start of the season so we had our fill of stone crabs claws and Alaskan king crab legs. . Service here was spectacular and we were seated at the most perfect booth off in the corner. It felt very private and secluded but we were still able to see the whole restaurant and were never ignored by the staff. . . Everything was brought out at the perfect time, at the right temperature and we had everything we needed. All the crab was well cracked and easy to eat, and that mustard sauce was as good as I remember it being in Miami. . . I would recommend the steaks or the sole with the brown butter sauce. They filet it at the table and it is absolutely delicious. . . If you have the bucks and you enjoy fresh seafood, you can't really go wrong at Joe's. I didn't have a bad bite to eat. Even the pretzel bread was amazing!
Finally made it out here since hearing about it! We ordered the select stone crab claws and they were super juicy succulent deliciousness! The mustard sauce that came with it was good but they were fine without it. We also got a half dozen oysters that were very clean tasting and not too meaty.  The waitress also suggested we  try the fried chicken bc it was a house speciality. It was decent, however for the price I would have rather tried something else.  Next time I'll stick to the seafood and maybe a steak.  5 stars for the service and seafood!  Will be back!
50 day dry aged bone in rib eye is all I gotta say. I still dream about that nutty beefy flavorful cut of meat. I also thought the filet 6oz with lobster tail was a great combo for 50$. For some, the steaks might be a tad salty but it was perfectly seasoned for me.
I gave this place a 3 and it's not because of the food. The food is pretty good.  We come here pretty much every time we're in Vegas. This experience I just wasn't satisfied with our service. We just didn't get the attention to detail that we typically do. Our waitress name was Alexa. . . . Fun for a group of friends but very pricey.
Had an amazing meal tonight at Joe's. Crab was delicious, service was great and the wine list excellent.  Thanks to Dave for a memorable dining experience. We have now definitely made this our go-to place for laughs and food. Come here and have an awesome meal without breaking the bank!
Birthday celebration.  Got us a nice table for dinner. Staff is always extremely nice and thoughtful.  Gave us many options and daily specials. Started with shrimp cokatil then We went with alaskan king crab. It is in season and was part of the last fresh shipment they got. Also ordered sides of Jennie mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Love love love this place. Pricey but worth it.
i ate here on 10-28-14 around 4:30 pm for dinner.  even though i made reservations i opted to eat in the bar.  the bar staff did an amazing job!  their service was top notch and they took the time to ask me questions.  i loved how joe's makes the customer feel welcomed.. . for dinner i ordered a crab bisque as an appetizer.  it was very creamy and delicious.  i enjoyed my 20 oz bone in ribeye.  i loved how the meat was charred but very enjoyable!  the side was fries was good too.  for dessert i enjoyed a small slice of chocolate fudge pie!  good stuff.. . a great mixture of great service and quality of food!  my bill before tip was $86.  i would definitely go back again!
In terms of food, I find this place a little overrated, but it was still very good.  I mean, it offers pretty standard fair, in my opinion.  I've snacked and drank here 2 times... once in the lounge where the service was mediocre and once at the bar where the bartender made an incredible dark and stormy and an aviation to perfection.  Actually, I can't remember if they were prepared to recipe, but they were both delicious.  Also, I like the ambiance of the place.  It feels like an east coast or chicago type place; Even though it's in a busy mall, it feels more like an independent restaurant.
I do not write reviews often, but when I do...Oh Boy!   Joe's from start to finish was AMAZING! Upon being seated in dinning room as requested on reservation(we did not want to sit in patio) we were greeted by Susanne our server.  Very nice, upbeat lady who knew we were celebrating my birthday.  She made a cocktail recommendation to my mom who unfortunately did not like it.  With out hesitation it was replaced with something else! Oyster? probably the best I have ever had!!!  My Girl friend and I split a Bone in rib eye and 1.5lb of King crab.  Susanne said we would not be disappointed and boy did she and the kitchen deliver.  The crab was cracked table side to our liking and even brought out Garlic draw butter!!! OH MY!!!!!  Dad had the Sea Bass which was amazing!! Mom had the Halibut also AMAZING!! I cannot recall an better birthday dinner.  Thanks to Susanne again for the AMAZING service.  Her team members  also took very good care of us on little request here and there. I was sure to tip them on the way out! My family and I will definitely be back here again soon!!!
Checked them out for lunch when vacationing in Vegas. I know they are known for the stone crab which I'm sure is phenomenal. So my review is based on the other food (well the ones we ordered) so it may not reflect the general greatness of  Joe's. . . We sat in their "outdoor" seating so we can people watch. Attentive service as per pro tool in any upscale Vegas restaurant. The lobster bisque was delicious. Tasty and not too salty. Creamy and satisfying. I opted for the seafood salad (but really I should've gotten the tacos). Small portions, lumps of cold crab and pieces of half shrimp with the shredded greens. I was not that impressed. The dish was pretty blah. We had a bottle of Rose to go with lunch. Not a bad deal for 60 bucks a bottle. The caesar salad was ok. Love that they use big fat anchovies with it. Though the salad was a bit on the tart side.. . The prices were pretty steep. Our bill was almost 300 bucks, for lunch!! Thats pretty ridiculous. I could've gone to Per Se and gotten a solid meal for that price. It was ridiculous also considering that we ate salads! Wow. So personally I thick it's overpriced and overhyped. . . I can cross this place off my list. Probably won't be gong back.
Alaskan king crab legs!!! Oh my god. They are only available 3 weeks out of the year, they told me. I guess I'll be coming back every year. It was the freshest, most delicious crab I have ever had. The market price when I recently went was around $75 per plate of crab, but it was a lot of crab.. . Also, the key lime pie was ridiculously awesome. I've always been indifferent to key lime pie. Joe's pie, on the other hand, was irresistible. Also, the crab bisque soup was superb. Everything I have eaten at Joe's was above and beyond my expectations. . . I'll be back next year when the Alaskan King Crab legs are in season!
Joe's Stone Crab was as good as Miami. The food was outstanding. The Stone Crab to die for, our salad wonderful and the entrees all great. Wait staff was good and attentive. I came here expecting expensive and I got what I came for and worth the expense. This is one restaurant in Vegas I would go again.
We don't usually go for fine dining while in Vegas, but our friends raved about Joe's so we made reservations for dinner on a Saturday evening. . . We started out with oysters (fresh and delicious, and they have a unique icy mignonette that was neat) and the Select stone crab claws, which were awesome, especially with the mustard dipping sauce. Our server showed us how to extract the meat, and it was super easy because the claws are already cracked. . . The bread basket contained a nice variety and the servers kept bringing out more whenever we ran low.. . For our main, we opted for the bone-in dry aged ribeye (one is enough for 2!) from the specials and it was amazing! A perfect medium rare, charred on the outside which imparted a rich, smoky flavor. In comparison, our friends' regular ribeye ($22 cheaper) seemed anemic. . . My favorite of the assortment of sides we tried was the brussels sprouts. The "big daddy taters" were good too, although I thought we were ordering the Lyonnaise potatoes (not sure if they're the same thing?). I'd say skip the unremarkable mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.. . Their Bloody Mary is really good. Comes accented by a cocktail shrimp and celery stalk, and the rim is encrusted with parmesan(?) cheese.. . One of the more satisfying meals I've had in a while, and service was great (thanks Leanne!).
First time tried to stone crab claws thinking it was going to taste good since I'm  a big fan of crabs. I also saw it featured on food network. my family ordered the stone crabs and it was flavorless meat and probably the worst tasting crab I have ever  tasted.... I was expecting sweet crab meat like some other crab species and this was not it. The service was slow too. Maybe their other food items is good but I was disappointed in the stone crab itself. Will not be back.
My wife and I had lunch at Joe's on November 5 2014 while in Las Vegas attending a convention. We were there at 3:10 PM so we decided to have lunch instead of dinner. I ordered the fish and chips and my wife ordered the fish tacos. The fish served with the fish and chips was horribly over cooked, there were 3 pieces of fish each weighed maybe an ounce each, they were full size pieces, just over cooked so badly that there was nothing left, the chips were just the standard steak fries that are served at about every nickel and dime restaurant across the country, nothing special. At $21.95 I expected something better than this.. My wife said the fish tacos were just ok, there were 2 tacos and some broccoli, nothing special, you can get better at Applebee's or Denny's for about $8.00, we paid $17.95 at Joe's. Add in $3.50 each for a couple of iced teas and our bill came to $50.70 less tip.. Bottom line: Joe's might be good for dinner, but if your looking for a good place for lunch, this isn't it.
Linda, the Brit, was excellent guiding us through our culinary experience through the wine, food and dessert menu.  We had the crab claws which were thankfully in season. They boil them in south Florida and then refrigerate them to be sold fresh at this gourmet restaurant. I wish we had ordered more of the stone crab and less of the king crab which was excellent and cut so easy to eat. Both excellent
We came here on a Saturday evening . And it was packed, we had reservations and came late and they were very accommodating .. . Ordered the crab claws. The meat was tasty but the way they cracked. The shells left bits of shells in the meat. . The cooked oysters were a hit with my friends. . The strip was ok. . The ribeye medium rare came out medium so they gave us another one no questions asked. . The baked potato was good. . The Alaskan king crab meat was delicious but was served cold. . I would recommend this place for a group of 5 plus. . The servers came around often to fill water :). . The only thing I didn't appreciate was the same server kept kicking the leg of my chair as he passed. Mofo
Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful in assisting with our meal. They recommended just the right amount of food and variety. . . As expected, the stone crabs were amazing.  The shrimp cocktail appetizer was delicious. . . I highly recommend making this a stop whether you are here in Vegas or in Miami!
We knew the Stone Crab name from dining years ago at the one in Miami, which drew us in for dinner several years ago.  We have been back to this restaurant in Las Vegas every time we are in town.  Dining in the Dining Room and on the patio (OK - not outside, but much cooler in the summer, and you can watch people strolling by) are both fantastic experiences, as the servers are VERY responsive, but we have taken to sitting in the bar.  The bartenders are excellent, we were there Nov 24th for lunch and sat at the bar this time.  The service was immediate, offering menus and drinks.  She was busy, but floated back and forth making drinks, while checking in with those of us sitting at the bar.   We get the same meals.  Crab Louis salad is the perfect size.  A little pricy, but they usually are and this one is loaded with crab.  My husband gets the lunch special of 5 medium claws with slaw (hand mixed at the table), hash browns, and key lime pie.  The mustard sauce is to die for.  The side dishes are too much to eat, as you need to focus on the claws.. . We have always had great experiences at Joe's but the friendly, smart service of our bartender, gives this trip 5 stars!
Came here yesterday for Thanksgiving dinner special since it was Thanksgiving.  The course was $38.00 for 4 slices of turkey breast and some dark meat, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes with marshmallows that melted in my mouth, and  asparagus. It was delicious!   We also had rib eye steak, crab salad, the kids ordered sliders.  They were all fantastic!  We went back again for dinner tonight because we're staying at Cesars Palace but also because the food was fantastic. Tonight i had their crab cakes.  Service is always superb and attentive. Definitely a 5 star restaurant!!!  I will be going back tomorrow....lol!
Staff was great.  Food was excellent. We had the grilled seafood platter and the stone crabs (select).  Excellent choices.  Wealso had the sauteed oyster mushrooms.  Again, great.  We go to Joe's every time we are in Vegas and love it.  Wish we had one in Colorado.  Wine is pricey and the food is pricey.  But good.  We even bought the cookbook.
A really consistent Lettuce venue. WE love the one in Chicago but were a little leery of a casino based location. Worry not. Precisely the same excellent service, and food.. . If you are not a seafood lover I would skip Joe's  While the steak are pretty good, the reason to spend a fortune is the seafood ...especially the crab selections. . . I'm not going to over review this but let it be said that Joe's brings the goods at whatever location you might visit   Great seafood, some of the best service in the industry...but ......It ain't cheap Yelpers  But that is OK with me
