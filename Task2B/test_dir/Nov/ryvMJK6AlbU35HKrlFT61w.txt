I've been here a few times and the food is impeccable! I LOVE love love the ribeye meat! OMG!!!! All the beefs and the lamb is delish!!!!! Oh and let's not forget about that salad bar! Oh my my my!!!! I wish I had an extra appetite or belly to bring with me! Lol. And the desserts are yummmmmy too!!!!! That caramel cheesecake thing....oh heck! Yummmmmmmmy!!!!! The service is always amazing, atmosphere is nice and the food.......need I say more! Oh yeah, make a reservation otherwise you have an hour plus wait!!!! But so worth it!!!!!
If you are squeamish at the sight of carnage, then this isn't the place for you.  Now if you believe as I do meat is your best friend, then read on. . . This is a carnivores dream come to reality and as you see slabs of carcasses being paraded around, your mouth will just water in expectation.. . You rookies to the scene will want to attack the well appointed salad bar and stuff yourselves with plenty of carbs.  This is protein-fest so keep your eye on the objective and avoid loading up on the salad bar. . . There is only two cuts of meat I eat here after having tried all the rest several times.  The flank steak is phenomenal and worth not being overlooked. It's seasoned to perfection and it gives you that gritty taste you expect from it being grilled on charcoal. . . Although my go to cut is the Picanna (Pee-ka-nya) which is mouth watering bliss. I always ask for medium rare and they will bring it to you cooked this way.  The marbling on the cut is fantastic. With a thin layer of fat on the outside of the cut, with their cooking techniques, it masterfully delicious.  I always trim the fat off my steaks except her. It's simply UH-Mazing. . . If by the end you have room for desert you are a champ and I bow in the front of greatness. I on the other hand never have room for desert here. . . If you want some carbs on your plate, serve yourself some white rice and then pour some black beans on top of the rice.  At first this may sound disgusting but once you try it, I dare you not to go back for more. Also try the sweet plantain. Before you move on to a new cut of meat, have a piece of the plantain to clear your palette. . . If you have your female companions with you, they can just eat off the salad bar for half the price. Bon appetite!!!
Top class. Staff was incredible,  food is amazing!   I was overwhelmingly impressed with everything. Definitely a new favorite!
It was my first time here. My family had talked this place up for like...2 years. And GOOD GOD was it worth the wait. It is clearly pricey. Just about $50 a head, but for all you can eat meats like beef sirloin, filet minion, and leg of lamb...it's an amazing deal. The food was INCREDIBLE. The meats are normally prepared medium-ish, but they will gladly take them back and cook them more if you wish. Our servers name was Samuel. He was attentive and an all around awesome server. His service and the incredible food is what will keep me coming back!! Totally worth the $$$!!
I go here about once a month & it never disappoints! The meats are fantastic & the service is (usually) excellent! The pricing for drinks is a bit steep, but the atmosphere & selection make it all worth it. Definitely a go to spot! Top sirloin & the cheese bread are amazing, a must try for any newbies! . . Tip: Go there HUNGRY!
No better way to celebrate a birthday and honoring Veterans than stuffing yourself silly with mouth watering meats and everything in between. TDB is a carnivore's paradise, from filet mignon to top sirloin to lamb chops the list goes on and on but I have to say the flank steak was my favorite. There's nothing much to add to what's already been uttered again and again about this place being good, it's one of those places you just have to try for yourselves at least once. For me personally, I never get my moneys worth at AYCE places so for next time, Friday lunch (they're only open Fri-Sun for lunch) at about $33 would probably be my best bet. According to our server Adam (who by the way was awesome!!!) There's only a few item difference in the salad bar area between lunch and dinner, but as far as the meat goes it's the same line up. Food, ambiance and service was all on point which makes it a 5 star experience.
My bf and I LOVE this place!! Our fave is the house sirloin!!! It's sooo good it melts in your mouth goodness!! Oh and the lobster bisque is yummmyy too!
The food here is really, really good for Brazilian BBQ. I loved that they offered Filet. No other Brazilian restaurants I've ever been to have had Filet. So that's a nice treat. . The meat selection came soo fast. Before we could take a bite there was another server with another meat selection. . So I'll be back because of the food. . . The service from our waiter left a little to be desired. She was slow with out drinks and very uninformative that there were going to charge us $3.00 for every 8oz of canned soda that we drank.. . Besides that, the food was good and I can't wait to be back in Vegas for another meal here.
Brazilian steakhouses, I don't like, I love! One word: Gluttony! This Texas De Brazil is such a great place to visit but ever since they went up on their prices for dinner and stopped their birthday 2 for 1 deals all at the same time we stopped giving them our hard earned money. We would tell everyone else also who loved steak like we did and they were just as disappointed as we were. We go to Via Brasil instead now, atmosphere and food is just as good and salad bar is a lot more fresh, better selections all around. Our disappointment has worn off since we started going to Via now. Besides its away from all the Vegas strip noise too, a lot better all around.
Been coming since opening day but for some reason last weekend was almost terrible. The seating was terrible because my chair was place in a high traffic area so everyone that works there was bumping into me all night. Food is still great but the service is lacking. I had to asked for the lamb chops twice and they didn't serve it until I was there for 1hr 30mins. Some of the fillet minions were also dry. The dessert menu needs upgrading and what's distasteful is that the manager was too busy watching MMA at the bar instead of making sure the customers were satisfied.
Went here for a retirement dinner for a friend. There were about 20 of us. I must say the service was excellent and the food was wonderful. I enjoyed every one of the beef entrees. I didn't really care for the pork but that was just me as the rest liked it. I'm not a seafood/fish eater but the group I was with raved about the smoked salmon and the bisque. If there was one minor complaint it took about 1/2 an hr to get our dessert after ordering which for us wasn't a big deal as we were not in a hurry. 5 stars.
OK, start off with the +, excellent, and I mean really excellent service from the wait staff. Part of the large cost of the meal I always appropriate to the service alone. The problem, both my wife and I were quite ill the next day, we called to advise them, no refund, no we will take care of you next time, we just got, "we had over 500 people yesterday, it couldn't have been us". Annoying as we spent $300+ over two sessions in the last month, and its as if they are implying we are trying to get something free from them, not the case.
The food was exceptional and the service was incredible.  Recommend the lobster bisque!  Filet Mignon and Lamb Chops are the best i have ever had.  Amazing dinner.
Service: Excellent. We had reservations for ten people for thanksgiving dinner. They called to confirm the reservation the day before and seated us promptly when we arrived. The waitress was friendly and efficient. The manager came by our table to check on us, which was a nice gesture.. . Food: Excellent. The garlic sirloin, bacon wrapped filet, regular filet, regular sirloin, and lamb are all must eats! You will get a card on your table, green side up indicates you would like more food, red side up indicates you do not. The servers with meat skewers will ask you to use your tongs to catch the meat as they slice it. The food is hot and absolutely yummy. The buffet area with cheese and salad is very good. The couscous and red quinoa are perfectly prepared. . . Atmosphere: Fun, average noise level, dimly lit. Good for family dinner or night out with friends. . . Overall: Can't wait to come back and would recommend to family and friends. My husband actually took several of his friends back the next day for dinner.
