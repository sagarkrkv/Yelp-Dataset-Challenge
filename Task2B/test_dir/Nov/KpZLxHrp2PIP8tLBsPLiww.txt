I got here around 10:30pm, I was visited friend from out of town at tower 1. Guard gate right in front of the property make me feel safe. The hotel smells fantastic. Nice, quiet and clean. Starbucks on site is a plus! The only down fall was since I got there so late the parking attendant had mentioned I could not park my car at the valet due to I am not a hotel guest. So I have to park at MGM self-park and walk back to The signature. . Good thing I wore comfy shoes that night....otherwise this review could be worse! LOL...Overall...The room is nice with large bath tub,separated shower and toilet.
We stayed here in Oct 2014, and I booked a one-bedroom suite through MLife. The hotel was discounted at quite a significant amount on there, so I highly recommend anyone to check it out! . . From McCarran airport, I'd say that the distance by car took about 15-20 minutes. Not bad at all. Initially I had called The Signature a week before to notify them that we'd be arriving to the hotel around 9am, & would like an early check-in. I had to verify several times with the woman if there would be any problems, but she assured me that the note on my account has been made and a room would be ready for me. HOWEVER, we arrived, checked-in, and Edward told us that our room was not yet ready. I informed him about our early check-in, and all he could tell me was that it was not a guarantee. Why did the woman on the phone not tell me this!?!?! We just arrived to Vegas, were tired, but luckily.... Also hungry so we left our bags with the bell-hop and went to breakfast. . . . The Room: . Edward called me after 11am to inform me our room was ready. When we opened the door to our suite, we were just so amazed beyond words. It was huge, so clean and so beautiful! Not to mention, a balcony also? The master bedroom had an amazing hot tub, shower, and two counter tops... one with a mini tv that catches the local cable. The bed in the master bedroom was so comfortable, not too firm not too soft... just right with really soft pilows! . . The living room area also includes a small bathroom, with a shower, toilet, and sink. This is perfect for guests because there is also a pull-out sofa bed in the room. The minimum capacity for this room is 4, but I believe it could fit so much more people ;) It's perfect for small get-togethers, a kitchen and bar top is also included with all the necessary appliances. Utensils are all available upon request. . . We didn't have any maid service until our very last day, but the custodian service was excellent. We needed cups, extra towels, and some other bathroom necessities... called the front desk, and everything was brought up in a timely manner.. . . Upon departure, we required a van/suv to head back to the airport (due to the amount of people in our group). The valet called it for us, and after they saw us waiting for 10-15 minutes.... they took the matter into their own hands, and decided to personally take us to the airport themselves... in The Signature-owned SUV. Might I add, they provided ice cold water for all passengers and the SUV was extremely clean and brand new. How amazing can it be that they would go above and beyond for their customers like this? At this point, the early check-in problem was no longer an issue for us. We are looking forward to returning to Vegas, and hopefully in a two-bedroom suite at The Signature next time. Highly recommend!!
I've stayed here 2 times and I loved it!! Every tower is different it has it's own theme to it. It's all suites with hot tubs and they are beautiful. The people in the front are very nice and friendly. There's an inside walkway to the mgm wich is great about a 10 minute walk I will definetly stay here again I loved it
Ive stayed here a few times and love these towers. The ONLY reason I'm not marking it as 5 star is because there is one RIDICULOUSLY LONG walk to the MGM Grand thru some walkways that feel like an airport. There are a few people movers but there needs to be more because after a night of drinking and walking, this additional walk just sucks. The rooms are big, nice, roomy. The bathroom area in its self is so fancy :)
Our condo was fantastic. It was 950 sq. ft. Was 1 bedroom, 2 bathrooms and had a fully stocked kitchen.  Even a sub-zero frig. This condo was a corner unit with the bedroom having floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides. The bedroom has a large oval desk with a motorized tv that rises up out of the desk. All the drapes are motorized. Bedroom has two closets. Another closet in bathroom. Bed was large and comfortable. The one thing it had that you don't find much in Vegas was a balcony. Our view was overlooking the pool area that rivals grounds found in Hawaii..    The entire complex is non-smoking and no casinos....and is a gated community with manned guard shack....but, an indoor walkway with moving sidewalks take you to the MGM Grand casinos with all the smoke and noise you could want. In other words, you can have a relaxing time laying in the sun around the pool(s) or a few minutes walk to the fast action and nightlife. .    Check in was fast....no line. Check out was on tv screen. Parking is free but valet only. The complex is beautiful inside and out and striking from a distance. .    The only downside is that the noise at night from the airport is noticeable. Tip: try to get the non-airport side..    Prices vary but I think we were there during a busy week for conventions because nobody was cutting deals. We got this condo (with daily housekeeping) for $135.66+Tax for each of three nights. That is a deal.
This place is awesome! My wife and kids love it. Its clean and the rooms are huge. You have at least 3 pools to choose from plus a lazy river. Balconies with amazing views. The only thing that I hate about this place is the mandatory valet parking. I absolutely hate other people driving my cars. They are careless and sometimes things have come up missing. I even had my custom rims scratched once. So from now on I drop the family off in the front and go park somewhere nearby MYSELF.
Pretty good deals for a major hotel on the Strip.  While the Signature is on Harmon, there is an indoor bridge to the MGM Grand with access to LB BLVD.  Spacious rooms at a decent value!!!  Only downside is parking is Valet only.
We booked our room thru Kayak.com and from the moment we stepped into the lobby- the staff treated us rudely because we didn't book with them directly. Seriously, no one books directly. That's why sites like kayak are in business. . The front desk girl told us if there were no complimentary waters in the room, we could come back to the front desk and ask for some. When we did- a different front girl staff argued with us for 7 mins. The conversation went something like this, 'We received no complimentary waters and we were told we could pick some up here.' Employee: 'Well...... if I felt like getting you some, I could. I feel like doing that though'. No lie. Just mind boggling. Not only things like that, but there was no maid service since we 'booked thru a 3rd party'. If you book 'thru a 3rd party' a cleaning service- off site- must be called even if you need a washcloth. Just so you know, they don't show when you call them. So, again, The Signature punishes you for using 2014 technology just by simply booking online. . It's a pain to be forced to valet park your car. There is NO self parking, unless you want to park at MGM and walk back to The Signature. FTR- it's a loooooooong walk. So you have to valet park. . They do have free WiFi and it was good and fast. So that's a plus. . Was the place clean? Yep- minus the drunk guy passed out, literally, blocking the door to our room. Again, no lie (pic posted to prove it). He was there all night long. All. Night. Long. No security ever came by to remove him. Matter of fact, we never once saw any type of security here. That's uncomfortable.. Would we come back? Naw. Much better places where you're treated like a human even if you didn't book directly with them, convenient to amenities, maid service, water and you can self park. . Kinda feel bad if you're one of the condo owners that rents out their condo. I'm not sure what you get for your money there, but it's not a pleasant experience for those who stay at your place. "/
Just checked in. Great staff member, Tanya, upgraded me to a suite. Very nice and quiet space. I was a bit leery of staying at MGM for this business meeting, but this really rates highly. An oasis away from the rest, but easy access if you want to partake!
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the MGM Signature.  I will most likely choose this hotel again the next time I visit Las Vegas.  Below are a couple of reasons why I loved the Signature:  . . 1.). It's connects to the MGM Grand.  No need to drive or walk outside the property.. . 2.) it's a non-gaming hotel.  I loved how the lobby and the elevators (especially) were not crowded and busy.  It was kind refreshing how peaceful it can be.  . . 3.) The property is gated which makes you feel very safe.. . 4.) Valet! I love that I don't have to worry about parking.  There is always someone at the valet stand waiting to retrieve your car. No wait!. . 5.). You really get your money's worth.  I highly recommend getting at least a 1 bedroom suite.  The pics on the website are pretty much on point.  I was not disappointed at all.  . . If I were to give one criticism, it would be for the staff to be more welcoming.  I wasn't always greeted in the lobby or valet.  It's not a huge issue, but it does make a difference.  Especially when you're treated very well when visiting other hotels in the area.
Booked a deluxe suite for a wedding weekend last week for myself the first night (Tower 1, Penthouse 36th floor), then shared a balcony suite with four of the other bridesmaids before and after the big day (Tower 2, 16th floor). . . I liked that it was a non-gaming, nonsmoking luxury hotel, and had a private gated entrance and 24hr concierge, private balconies and in-suite dining options. I did have one issue with getting locked out of my room and front desk was very helpful with sending maintenance up to assist. . . Depending which side of the Towers you get assigned to, you may be facing the Las Vegas airport and the back of MGM Grand, or facing more of the Strip. . . Fitness centers only available in Towers 1 and 3, Starbucks in Tower 1, etc. I really liked that it's connected by walkway to the MGM Grand (a bit of a walk) but no need to drive, catch a cab, or walk outdoors. . . Bellhops were good, I had them store my luggage in between check-outs and check-ins, or after I checked out but before I headed to the airport. . . Next time I'll be sure to use the MLife benefits/perks! . . Cab fare one-way to from the airport to the Signature was under $20.
Stayed at the Signature 4 days...rented directly from an owner. Arrived at approximately 6:45am, anxious to check in and rest after a long drive (did not happen--had to call the owner to get an early check in --hence minus 1 star) after an approx. 45min wait; we were checked in to a very nice spacious room overlooking the pool and monorail. . . Valet and Bell services were fast,  friendly and helpful.  put on your comfy walking shoes if you plan to walk to the adjacent MGM or the strip, it's quite a walk. Weekdays are not quite as busy as the week like rolled around and so did the crowd in the jacuzzi. I like the fact that it's a no gamling/no smoking hotel to provide a quiet retreat that is close to the strip.
Super impressed with the Signature Towers! Will use again!. I found the listing for our tower 1, 8th floor room thru AirBnB. Having been tricked by pretty hotel pictures before, I was sure this place would be too good to be true. I was delighted to find that it was indeed just as clean, friendly, and stylish as expected. . I learned that many of the rooms here are condos, timeshares or used as extended stay rooms as they all have kitchenettes and spacious bathrooms. They don't offer daily room cleaning either because of this, but they are happy to provide extra pillows, sheets and toiletries as needed (if you do need a room clean, you can call and schedule it for a fee). The towers also don't have a casino or formal restaurant, instead it has a small hotel bar and a Starbucks. For a weekend stay, these things weren't an issue for me, and in fact I liked not having them- it kept the place quiet.. The only downside is the 10 minute walk from our tower to the main MGM casino/hotel. The walkway between the tower and the casino is covered, clean, well lit, and easy to follow so all in all, it was an ok trek back and forth.
Was here for a bachelor party and the suites were fantastic. We were on the penthouse which was opulently appointed with an incredible amount of space and a fantastic view from the huge balcony.  The facilities and common spaces were also excellent.  All of this and the cost of accommodation was exceptionally reasonable.  I'd go back.  . . The only note is watch which tower you are in.  The third tower is a long walk from the strip.
