Food. $23 diver sea scallops shaved fennel. Three scallops, appeared to be fresh, slightly over cooked, mild flavor, nothing special. Just so so. . . $22 hand cut waygu tartare crostini. The texture was very soft and lacked something crispy or different to it.  They crack a raw egg into it and I think that gave it a slimey coating to the tartar. It has good flavor on its own but I wish that I hadn't ordered waygu in this tartare format.  It was difficult to tell if the meat was any good.  It didn't seem like but the egg and flavors covered it up pretty good. Good meat shouldn't be chopped up like this :(. The crostini is super salty but it was a nice size and good crunchy and fluffy texture.  . . $55 18 oz ribeye, dry aged angus, bone in, medium rare. It was served medium well :(. Flavoring was amazing! It had a nicely grilled flavor that was a bit smokey, sweet, and salty.  Great dimension and balance.  The downside... The meat was tough and at first I thought it was because I had a dull knife. It took a lot of effort to cut through the chewy meat. It had a lot of connective tissue.  I was really surprised and asked if this was indeed dry aged.  The outer part of the steak had great flavors but the inner part was flavorless and bland. Sort of like a 20 minute aged steak where it didn't have enough time to soak into the main parts. I so wanted this to be good but it wasn't :(. . . $15 baby spinach garlic oil. Fantastic!!! One of the best spinach side dishes I've ever had at a steak house.  Fresh, perfectly cooked, and flavorful. I highly recommend this.. . $15.00 Cinnamon Monkey Bread. Cinnamon brioche pecan toffee sauce, banana ice cream. Amazing!! The flavors had a nice punch to the palate and the ice cream was over the top! Don't leave here without trying this.. . Decaf coffee. Came in a French press. Very nice robust flavors for a decaf.  Excellent portion.. . Service. Attentive and friendly staff. Great service!. . Overall. Would not recommend the beef here. . Come here for coffee and dessert instead!
Very delicious meal.. My major regret though is ordering the tasting over the a la carte. We did the $145 domestic wagyu "tasting". My issue was that for 2 people, it was more of an apps, sides, and desserts tasting over a steak tasting. The amount of apps, sides, and desserts was absurd and kinda took away from the steak experience for me (and it looks like the tasting portion of steak is smaller than the a la carte portion). I struggled hard to finish my steak and left so full I couldn't see straight. Might be better for a larger group.. . Nonetheless, I tried various delicious things and here's my recap:. - rolls- salty and fresh! Leftovers were great the next day too :). -Lobster bisque- big ass chunks of lobster and lots of good flavor, a little too rich to precede a steak dinner though in my opinion.. -Persian cucumber salad- light, refreshing, crisp. -Frisee- with the runny egg and Gorgonzola it gets a nice creamy texture. Lardons on point.. - wagyu tartare- not the best I ever had but still enjoyable. - wagyu skirt steak- one on the most memorable steaks I ever had! Got it medium rare and loved every second of it. - wagyu rib eye- found this to be a let down, it was tough and would have preferred the angus over the Kobe if I did it again. . - Yukon mashed potatoes- best I ever had. - mushroom medley- loved it. - broccoli rabe- I usually hate it, but it's well salted and garlicky so, done very well!. - mango cheesecake- my dessert fave!. - sticky pecan bun- very tasty but too big and decadent for my taste. I had 2 nice bites. If I finished the whole thing I would have exploded. Good for sharing.. - fruit- whatever it's fruit. Good but had it not come with the tasting I wouldn't order. - sorbet- good and light. . So as you can see, loads of food and you def get your money's worth. The skirt steak wagyu was the winner with potatoes taking the silver.. If I could do it again, I would order one of the above salads, skirt steak wagyu, mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and mango cheesecake or the sticky bun :). . Service was perfect and the steak knives were weird.
Service and atmosphere is superb, waitresses were really helpful and polite. On the other hand, as you may know this is a steakhouse and ironically that's exactly the area where it fell short. We ordered the shortrib and the ribeye. Shortrib was OK a little on the salty side but the big disappointment was the ribeye. Lack of flavor and not tender add you would expect. I'm a big meat eater, so I know my standards are little high, but I know that they could and should do better. Being this my first time and given the experience I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.
Ambiance was great! Very attentive staff! My friend and I each ordered the lobster bisque and seriously 'moaned' while eating it....food of the Gods! My friend ordered the NY Strip and it was seasoned so beautifully and cooked perfectly (she gave me a taste!)...I ordered the house specialty short ribs...crazy good!! We shared a side because they're huge...white corn grits! Could not finish our meals....so much food! Would definitely recommend!
Yelp let us down this time.  I debated between 1 and 2 stars but settled on 2 because the steak (reason we came here) was good.  Ambiance was OK but we made a reservation and were seated in the bar area.  This was annoying.  Another couple sat down next to us and complained about it and were re-seated at a table.  So I guess if you complain they give you a better table?  The restaurant wasn't full (7PM on a Saturday night), so I'm not sure why we were seated in the bar area with a reservation.  . . Appetizers: We got shrimp cocktail and lobster bisque soup.  Soup was good, big chunks of lobster in it, shrimp coctail was good but size of shrimp was very small considering the price.  . . We ordered all of our food when we sat down and told our waitress that we were in a hurry and were very hungry, so please bring the food as fast as possible.  We then waited an hour for our steaks.  I didn't like how the menu had two options for steaks - grilled or roasted, the roasted was 20% more and our waitress offered very little information about the difference between the two.  Here is my take - I don't know what is the best way to cook a steak - I think the restaurant should have their method and sell it as the best method.  We ordered one of each thinking we could try each others to see the difference.  Unfortunately, the waitress brought us two of the same steaks and when we figured out they weren't what we ordered, there was no offer to bring another one, or anything other than a meek apology from our waitress. . . Steaks were good, but mine was luke warm, like it had been sitting for 15 minutes warm.  . . Got the broccolini and gratin potato for sides, both were very good.  . . Each had a glass of the house Pino and was good but pricey @ $17 / glass.  . . Ordered the apple vanilla crisp for desert and it was fantastic but way overpriced @ $15.  . . Total before tip was $250.  Very disappointing experience, much better options on the strip, not sure how this place got such high marks.
As the epicenter of the Strip keeps migrating north, the MGM Grand in general just doesn't seem to have the pull it once did.  I feel the same way about Craftsteak.  This was probably amazing in 2002 when it opened.... . ...but, I think the more recent hotels on the Strip learned from the MGM and really raised the bar.  The steaks at Craftsteak were good, but the overall environment, experience, and location just can't compete with the likes of Prime, the SW steakhouse, Botero, the Eiffel Tower restaurant, etc.. . The tables near the entrance felt like eating in a mall.  Just didn't work for me.
Came here a few months ago dinner time. I love steak and I usually order ribeye medium rare everywhere I go. I didn't order the famous waygu meat (maybe I should) but I had the chewy-est rib eye ever. Ordered also the scallops which was delicious and the salad was plentiful and tasty.
Craftsteak is legit. Rachel, our server, was awesome.  She was so attentive to our group. . . We brought our own wine but some of our party ordered cocktails - the French martini was delicious. . . The table bread was served warm with the perfect sprinkling of salt and the butter was soft (important details here...nothing worse than hard butter with bread).. . I ordered the $79 wagyu skirt steak which is a splurge but it was highly recommended so I had to check it out. It was delicious and could have easily fed 3 people. Good to know for next time! We got a variety of sides to share including the shishito peppers, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, spinach and butternut squash. The lobster salad was fresh - perfect squeeze of lemon.  The shishito peppers were not my fave, there was something missing so I ended up salting them. The shrimp cocktail came with 5 pieces of plump shrimp for $23. The cucumber salad was tasty. We ordered a side of fries for the kids, I think I ended up eating at least half of the bowl. Ha. They were cooked perfectly with the right amount of crunch and seasoning.. . Dessert was amazing. Apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream was delicious as was the souffle with caramel ice cream. I didn't try the monkey bread served with banana ice cream because someone was holding it hostage at the other end of the table.. . As you can see, our ordered a good portion of the menu so I can easily say you should try Craftsteak for a special occasion. It ain't cheap but good eats.
Amazing food! My second time there and i can't wait to go back. I had the surf and turf which is steak and lobster. It was the same thing I had when I last visited, so I had to order it again. Also had the whipped potatoes and the assorted mushrooms. Outstanding wait staff. They made sure the food was perfect. They also sent over a little happy birthday message on our dessert for my husband. Best steak and lobster I have ever had!
Ok. I'm going off the (proverbial) ranch. I've had so many great (and not so much) ribeye steaks over the years, I've decided it's time to start cataloging. Tonight I had the 18oz bone in ribeye which was perfectly cooked with the juices served in the pan. The ribeye was 8.3/10. The butternut squash side dish was amazing. The banana and rum raisin ice cream put me over the top, but their dinner rolls simply rocked. Nice Kosta Browne Pinot to complement.
The bisque, steak, mushrooms, oh hell, everything here is insane. It's the first stop we make here when we come into town and the last thing we talk about when leaving. My tip: Sit at the bar! The service is impeccable and you will always have a full glass. Make this one of your destination evening spots!
The food was excellent and the staff was even better.  The bread was fresh, moist, and delicious.  I ordered the lobster bisque and fillet mignon and it was quite good.  The attentive and polite staff never left me wanting.  I enjoyed it very much.
The service and the food was excellent. We had Kevin as our waiter. He made wonderful recommendations. We both got the 18oz bone in Ribeye and it was cooked to perfection. The lobster bisque was to die for!!
Great dinner...wonderful food, attentive waiters and beautiful atmosphere.  Recommend the shrimp cocktail, ny strip and the monkey bread.  The wine flight was great!  Thanks for the great evening. Randall the waiter rocks!!
Hands down one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Every single plate they brought out was nothing but amazing and sooooo good!!!! I reccomend anyone who is ready to drop down some serious money to eat here. So worth it!
Came back for another tasty Craftsteak meal. The food was good but the service was atrocious. We were seated and told our server that we had a show to get to in 2 1/2 hours. We were assured this would not be an issue. We immediately ordered (since we knew precisely what we wanted) and thought this would be a quick in/out since it was not particularly busy. Long story short.....we arrived at our show late. The drink refills came slow, food came out slow, and we waited for our ticket for what seemed like an eternity. I am only knocking off one star because the food was still tasty (but not as tasty as I had remembered it being). . . We will give it another try the next time we are in town but perhaps we will do it after a show!
I had this place 7 days ago and I still crave it!! The entire table got something different and the four of us are rather picky. Let me just say our entire table was beyond pleased! I got the chicken which is step 2 chicken and hard to attain at most restaurants. They bring you incredibly high quality ingredients and spices. You can taste the difference even in the fingerling potatoes. The chefs back there must really have it down everything was just awesome! It is pricey our meal for 4 people with 1 whiskey drink and 4 meals and 4 sides was 400$ +so make sure you look at the prices and don't be shocked by a big bill. This place is totally worth the splurge! Will be back 100 times every chance I get I will eat here!
I've been to nearly all the high end steakhouses on the strip, and this is hands down my favorite. The A5 Wagyu melted in my mouth... I really think it melted. Service was top notch, and everything from A to Z was perfect. The presentation of their food is a major plus as well. Having Silver Oak by the glass? Also extra points. Wonderful restaurant.
We hit it big with the slots so we decided to use the $10 bucks we won to treat ourselves to some steak.  I recommend the risotto as a side.  My bone-in ribeye was good.  Our server was very attentive and the service was great.  Drinks were tasty and reasonably priced.  We made reservations ahead of time and was seated within 10 minutes of arriving.  I was satisfied with my meal and do recommend Craftsteak.  This place is on par with say SW Steakhouse but not a birdie.
Craftsteak is delicious!! I highly recommend the 3 course meal, it is a ton of food so you can even order it portioned for 2 people and split it between 3, or be ready for some leftovers! The food is great and the staff are awesome!
Divine!  That really sums it up.  Have the hanger steak.  It is simple perfection and honestly enough for two.  Tender, with the juices perfectly sealed in.  I dream of my next visit to Vegas and another amazing meal here.
I don't know a lot about Tom Colicchio. I don't watch Top Chef. I have just never seen it. So my opinion on this place is not because I am a fan of his TV work. I am a real fan of his food! . I have eaten at many high end, low end, and everything in between "steakhouses". My experience here was perfect. There is no other word to describe it. . We ordered the chefs selection with wagyu skirt, and wagyu strip, both came out cooked to perfection. They were exactly the way that we ordered them. The service was completely on point, the appetizers delicious (steak tartar, shrimp cocktail, warm frisee salad, heirloom tomatoes), the sides were very good ( brussel sprouts, potato puree, and mushroom assortment), and the monkey bread and perfect chocolate cake made a great ending. You are probably thinking that the portions must've been small to eat all of this, but they weren't. I just kept eating because I literally couldn't stop. . I can't wait to go back. I enjoyed it so much that I want to keep going back until I don't like it anymore. . I guess I will make it a point to watch Top Chef because I am definitely a fan now.
An amazing experience.  i had the shrimp cocktail, rolls, flat iron, butternut squash, and ice cream and  sorbets for dessert. It's definitely  a budget buster, but it was worth every penny. Friendly staff! The waiter grew up about 20 miles from me.
Honestly, there was little that was memorable or interesting about our dinner here last Friday. The food is solid, but overly salty (my tongue was swollen the next morning) and verged on boring.
I'm not a big foodie so I don't know who this Tom guy is, but my friend who booked Craftsteak says this guy is a pretty famous chef on the food channel. I guess that fact gives the guy the right to charge a pretty penny for dinner!  Haha. . . Anyways, I had the 14 oz wagyu ribeye.  I have to say it was a pretty awesome piece of meat!  I asked for it medium rare (that's the only way to eat a fine steak) and it was cooked to perfection!  If you're penny pinching don't come here, but if you're willing to pay a bit more I don't think you'll be disappointed!  The food and the service are both top drawer!  . . My mantra in life...  Sometimes you get what you paid for!  Haha
Huge disappointment. . . When you go out for an expensive steak dinner, the one thing that matters most is the steak, right? If that is done poorly, nothing else really matters. . . I went here with a party of 7, and 4 of our steaks were poorly done. Mine was so bad I had to send it back - twice! I ordered it medium rare, and it came back overdone. It was solidly medium, and probably on the well side of medium. At a Sizzler-type place I would have just eaten it, but this place is called 'CRAFTsteak', so presumably they should be able to get it right. I genuinely tried to be polite about it, and our waiter assured me that if I wasn't happy with it, I should absolutely send it back. I waited 20 minutes for the replacement, and when it came it was lightly seared on the outside and totally raw 1 millimeter in. That absolutely felt like a 'fuck you' from the kitchen. One other guy at our table also sent his first one back. At least his second came back right. Two others said theirs also weren't what they wanted, but they didn't want to bother with waiting for a new one.. . The icing on the cake was the manager. He came by when my second steak arrived and had the gall to tell me that my black-and-blue steak looked 'maybe a little underdone' from medium rare. The most he tried was to offer us a free dessert. That's a straight-up Applebee's move, not what you should have to deal with at a premium place like this. . . Two stars instead of one because at least three of our seven steaks were cooked the right way. The sides were fine, and our drinks were good. The service was mediocre. . . A place like this should have better odds than a roulette wheel.
My fiance and I went here end of October 2014 for our anniversary.  We both are huge Top Chef fans and love to splurge on food, especially steaks!  When we saw that Tom Colicchio had a steakhouse here, we definitely had this on our to do list while in Vegas.  Customer service was superb!  Thought it was a little odd they had a photographer come around and take photos of you, then sneak up to you right after you get your check and try and charge you an arm and a leg to purchase the photos that were taken of you...The ambience was very neat and modern, one thing I didn't like was where we were sitting, there was a spotlight that was directly over me which made it feel odd, very odd to take photos with a light shining on your head!  Unfortunately, as hard as it is to say, we both weren't impressed with the Top Chef himself!  We both ordered 18oz ribeye, we didn't go for the wagyu cause holy crap was it pricey... the ribeyes were cooked perfectly medium rare, however there was no seasoning, no flavor, it needed the main necessities, salt & pepper.  Sorry Tom, but on this night, with this meal, I would say, Tom, please pack your knives, and go.
