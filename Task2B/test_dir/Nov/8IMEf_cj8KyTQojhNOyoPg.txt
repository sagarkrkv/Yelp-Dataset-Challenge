Second year here. Elevators still do not work and the front desk doesn't.have their act together. Expect long lines at check in and long waits at the elevator.

After many years as a loyal Caesers property  visitor I can say with 100 percent honesty this will be the last time!!!  Having just stayed 5 nights at the Rio I am so disappointed. From the elevators not working to the keys not working to the water completely stopping while I was full of soap (for a full 5 minites) in the shower I've had enough. I took my very valid complaints to the front desk at checkout, well unless you are a platinum or higher total rewards member forget it!!!!  My friends had less valid complaints and because they are platinum they were pretty much compt for their entire stay as well as getting a limo ride to the airport. We tried to use the fitness center and were told it is 12.50 if you aren't paying resort fees which I was because it's manditory for Gold level members. The whole experience was very demeaning they continued to make us feel like we were not as important as our fellow travelers from check in where we couldn't have rooms close to each other again no platinum level or higher. They did however take off $88 for our trouble. Wow I didn't expect to get my whole stay free but they didn't even care! Crazy since I actually paid for our room and lost alot of money there. Live and Learn! One star for the $88 comp
Old and run down. The bath tub and sinks don't drain right and you stand in your own water in the shower. Also some nice red duck tape to hold the carpet down in this room. Thanks for rolling out the red carpet for us Rio! . We over paid for this room and when we voiced our concerns they waived our resort fee. The Rio is not wort the money you think you will save staying off the strip...
I went to Vegas for the first time for my bday weekend and it was amazing!! I stayed at this hotel and I can say my stay was pleasant. Neither did my boyfriend, cousins or I have any problems while our stay here. The bed was comfortable and the sheets as well. The room was pretty cheap too, altogether it was about $300 (2 nights). It wasn't all glamorous of course but I think for the price it was decent. The bathroom was clean and so was the area where I got all dolled up! ;) Few things I didn't like was that the snacks and drinks they offer in a lil fridge are too expensive. $5 for a can of soda or a snickers? $10 for nuts? That's ridiculous! Of course one can take their own snacks but I just thought i'd mention that. Another thing is the housekeeping. On Saturday morning we woke up at 7 (yes, i know, it's early lol) and were out of the hotel room by 8 am. We went and explored the strip, had some breakfast, went shopping and didn't get back to the hotel until about 4 pm. As we walk to our rooms we see the house cleaners' utilities there and we are like "Wow, they are barely cleaning?" Neither my cousins' or our room were even cleaned!!! This is why it loses a star. I mean I would think they would have done this in the morning. My boyfriend and I even ate at my cousins room, we chilled for about an hr or so and our room was not cleaned yet and no one had gone to their room to check if we still needed the cleaning. We finally went back to our own room and as soon as we got comfortable enough to take a nap after a long day of walking there's a knock on the door. "Housekeeping" Seriously? At that point we just declined it because we were too tired. That is the only "bad" experience we had. Other than that, our stay here was pleasant!
Is there a minus 5 star review because that's what I would give to them! DO NOT STAY AT RIO!!!!! I have been coming to Vegas for years & years & never in a million years I would encounter something like this!. We stayed at room 12004 & we  noticed the smell of odor coming from the hallway, our neighbors told us that they had been complaining but they did nothing.. We came back to the room around 2:30 am & got woken up by the itch sensation & that's when we saw some crawling bugs on the beds that we slept in. I freaked out crying because It was all over my body (my leg & arms). I called the front desk & they sent the security up to our room. He provided us with bio hazard bags to put our clothes in. We left all of our belongings & got out of there, only to wait for hours. The managers at the front desk didn't seem that surprised when we told her, offered another room but we didn't want to stay there....not EVER again. We lost everything we brought, only the clothes we wear...& bumps all over my body. They only offered $50 to get a couple clothes to wear in the gift shop where average clothes are around $40-$100!!!!!!!! Las Vegas for I have come here so many many times! It really bothers me that they think this is a normal thing & even mentioned "Even WYNN Hotel has them!" WOW!!!!!
Charged A Resort Fee But No Services Were Provided   . . I was charged a resort fee of $24.64 for staying at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino.  However, the resort area, swimming pool etc, was not open on the date.  The sign outside of the pool area says it will not be open for the whole season.  How can they close the pool area and still think that charging a resort fee is fair?  I also stayed at Golden Nugget and had no problem paying their resort fee.  . . The room I got at Rio was ok.
Nice clean modern rooms. Great views. Take advantage of the shuttle system. Had a great time during my stay at the Rio.
It's an a nice casino with some great shows to watch and one of the main venues for the WSOP
Rio hotel is a nice hotel. Rooms are bigger than the hotels in old Downtown. Bathroom is nice, but the only thing that annoyed me was our room phone kept ringing at night. My husband answered the phone thinking it was the desk, but it was some kids prank calling. Rude & disrespectful. Other than that our stay was okay.
I got a full body massage here at the Rio Spa....wow Dexter the man with the golden hands.   That massage was probably the best massage I've had so far.  If in Vegas treat yourself to a Massage by Dexter.  You will not be disappointed.  Let's not forget the awesome  staff that works in the spa.  The attendants are on point. Excellent  customer service all around.
Here's the Rio:. . Great value (if crashing is all you're doing here).. Hard to find a spot so connected to all the places you'll want to go, without having to pony up for the "cool tax."  But if you're paying north of 100 bucks a room = not worth it.. *Room was a suite and it was nice!. . Irrelevant facility.. Nothing really going on here.  Pool is lame sauce, bunk club, etcetera.. . Staff is great.. Ricky at the front desk was on point.  Everybody was nice, that's all yo really want in a spot - for them not to get in the way of your stay.  Everyone seems to make the most of their "Off Broadway" status.. . *Breakfast at Hash House is a must.. Highlight of the spot.. . Only bummer: the ventilation on the casino floor during peak weekend hours is brutal if you're a non smoker.
Wow almost made me cry for being a good customer. I was playing their electronics craps machine, the machine would not let me clear my beat or cash out my money. An employee passing by and I asked for help, he was short and said press that button (collect) it miraculously worked.  My husband though it was me not machine so I tried playing again this time with a smaller bill as I didn't want to risk loosing too much money. It happened again. I gave up playing and after several games the machine let me collect my money. I just realized they don't let u take out ur money unless u loose!!!!. Steve D., gambling Manager, comes over without being called and asked what the problem; I was surprised as no one called him. When my husband and both tries to explain, this tone got nasty! I was so embarrassed! It was only $3 each hand that had been lost that I could take out. I never asked for it, I didn't ask for him yet when we tell him what he doesn't want to hear belittles customers. I have spent thousands as a customer and they lost me over Steves tone. Everyone in the machine was in shock over his tone. Never coming back!
Sort of a basic hotel that is off strip - a bit older of an offering with a smaller casino layout that is pretty easy to navigate through . . Restaurants in the hotel are pretty basic, there are 2 different Starbucks to keep traffic to a minimum - I have not stayed here, but I am here once a year for the national go-kart race that is in the parking lot each year -- which will be changing to a different location in 2015.... . The main attraction for the Rio is the buffet which gets very crowded when there are larger conventions or events going on at the casino - to which I have not been impressed with the food all that much. The Casino can get smokey and is probably not the best place for kids. . All in all - a cheaper off strip hotel probably one of the few originals that are left from the early 90's that came at the time right before the strip expanded past the mafia ran casinos that were torn down for what is there today.
