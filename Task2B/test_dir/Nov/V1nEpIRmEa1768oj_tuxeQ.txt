Nice, little lunch spot....by Arizona standards.. . The outdoor seating area is relaxing, provided that it isn't 1,000 degrees outside, but keep in mind that you will constantly be harassed by a multitude of flies.  It's disgusting and ruins the experience.. . The service can be hit-or-miss, but most of the time it is adequate.. . They lose a few stars when compared to Fired Pie.  Cibo doesn't seem to cook their pizzas long enough, which makes the interior soft, squishy, and unappetizing.  That is a pet peeve.. . Cibo is also more expensive.  Why?  Who knows.  I paid $10.00 for a single topping "lunch" pizza.. . At Fired Pie, you pay around $8.50 for the same size w/ unlimited toppings.. . In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have gone to Cibo for lunch.  Haha.
We had lunch here today. Great atmosphere and decor. We live in Ohio and search the world over for great pizza. This is very good Neapolitan style pizza. We also had a sandwich and it was excellent. Great restaurant.
We went with a big group and sat outside. They have a perfect outdoor setting. We started with calamari & the big tray of meats and cheese which I loved. We then tried all kinds of different pizza which was all pretty good. I would not say the best pizza I have ever had but pretty good. We got a couple of deserts that were made from crepes which were good as well. Not to die for deserts. Overall great spot. Would go back again.
The pizza is pretty tasty.  Solid thin crust italian style pie.  If i'm nitpicking they are pretty stingy on the toppings and I wish they were a dollar or two cheaper.. . Biggest complaint here is the building itself.  If you get stuck inside one of those tiny little rooms that were built originally as someone's bedroom with like 7 tables be prepared to hear everyone's conversation but your own.. . Ask for the crushed red pepper infused olive oil - it is glorious. Dump the crushed red pepper on that spicy sausage.  Heat lovers dream.
Great sandwich, delicious fries and pizza made the right way - meaning thin crisp crust (now there is a tongue twister for you), tasteful and not too greasy. I stopped by a few times during a business trip where I stayed at a nearby hotel. . . The outside area is great for gatherings, with live music and plentiful shade under the trees. . . For you loners out there, I can recommend sitting at the bar. Lively atmosphere, great service.
I really like Cibo. I've been here for lunch, dinner, and a special event at the "Carriage House." The food is really good. I prefer the sandwiches over the pizzas - especially the caprese sandwich.. They also had happy hour the last time I was there and the prices aren't amazing, but it's decent for what you get. I would skip the fried dough pieces. The fried rice balls are excellent, and the drink prices are really good.. Oh, and the little salad that comes with the sandwich is perfection. Plus, the weather is perfect right now and they have a large patio seating area.
One of my favs. The pizza is great and dessert pizzas are to die for. One of my go to spots for guests in town. Great cozy atmosphere for a date or just to catch up with friends.
AMAZING restaurant. Please please give it a chance!
My favorite place for pizza in Phoenix!   . . I absolutely love going to Cibo for many reasons.  What is there not to love about this place.  Cibo is a restaurant set inside of an early 20th century bungalow with beautiful hardwood floors and exposed brick. When you walk through the main doors, you are greeted by the hostess stand and a small quaint bar... there are several dining "areas" throughout the restaurant, as this was a "house" that has been renovated in the historic Filmore area just off the main downtown area of Phoenix.  . . The pizza here is fantastic.  People often compare this pizza to another popular pizza restaurant in Phoenix.  I don't think that there is a comparison.  Cibo is so much better.  I have tried several pizzas here, but my favorite, surprisingly, is the Genova.  I always order the pizza well done and the crust comes out nice and crisp.. . I love the Pear Salad as well.  The salad is huge and can be share between 2 friends.. . You must also try the lemoncello.  It is divine and the best in Phoenix that I've tried other than homemade.  . . Bon Appetite!
I had heard good things about Cibo and finally decided to try it. Luckily all of the good things were true! The food was great, only "complaint" I had is that the cheese and toppings fell off as soon as you lifted a slice, but it tasted great!. . The atmosphere is so cozy, inviting, and romantic. Great place for a date, or even just with friends or family. Definitely recommend the vegetarian pizza, and the Nutella banana crepes are to die for!
My wife and I tried this place (pronounced as 'CHEE-BO')a few months ago and have been back at least a half-dozen times since. If you like real Italian/Naples style pizza, this is your place. While they also do a specialty pasta dish a couple days during the week, pizza is really the heart and soul of the place.. . I like to dine here when the weather is nice and we can eat outside. On Friday and Saturday nights, they have a live jazz band outside. This can be a very romantic place to go and I highly recommend it for a date. . . All the deserts (except one) are using Nutella as an ingredient. I am not a fan of Nutella, but I must say the Pellani 2.0 is most excellent and only about $6. What is it? Imagine donut holes being served in a little metal basket with four wooden spears. You spear the donut hole with the little stick, then dip it in the ramekin of Nutella to your taste and enjoy! or, feed each other - very romantic.. . The prices for what you get are very reasonable. Parking can be a challenge or you can use their complimentary valet.. . Lot's of stuff to do downtown very close to this place (Film Bar, Angel's Trumpet, Crescent Ballroom, Breadfruit bar...too many things to do in this area that I can list here).. . Highly recommended, but very limited menu. If you like REAL pizza, in a unique and romantic atmosphere and very affordable. I only wish I knew about this place sooner.
I had lunch here with a colleague recently and we had a wonderful time. It was bit too chilly to sit in their lovely garden so we sat inside where it was more cozy. . . Lunch was excellent. I had the Polpette (meatball sandwich) and my friend had the PLT, both with a side salad. My sandwich was one of the best meatball sandwiched I'd ever had. The bread was chewy; the meat was flavorful; and the cheese was melted to perfection. The portion size for the sandwich and salad was perfect.. . The only thing this place has going against it is a lack of parking. I got there early so I could get free parking on the street about a block away (I don't believe in paying for parking when possible). There were meters and they have a complementary valet too for people willing to pay to park.
Was in phoenix visiting my bro early November. We had planned to eat at Breadfruit which is a jamaican restaurant nearby. The  wait was too long so we opted for Cibos.  Wow.  Must say i was impressed.  Lively atmospher. Fantastic food and wine.  Melissa was a great server. . . We had some wine at the bar for an hour then got our seat outside.  Perfect night with great food and service with a fun  atmosphere.  I now tell everyone to check out Cibos if in Az.   The people working here also love dining at Breadfruit.  It's refreshingly cool to see local businesses support each other.  This place is a converted house.  Thanks Cibos for a great saturday night.
Visited the Phoenix area from Chicago several times, and always wanted to try Cibo.  Glad we finally did!  My wife and I split a few things for lunch in the nice outdoor seating area.  The Alla Parmigiana sandwich with the side salad, and the Margherita pizza were all exceptional!  Definitely a return visit will be in order!
Their pizza is fantastic. I try a different version during each visit. Have not had a bad one yet!. . Try the marinara with mozzarella added. . . Not for those that have an aversion to anchovies!  Delicious.
If you cannot get into Pizza Bianco, come over to Cibo, or come to Cibo first and enjoy the great pizza, sandwiches, and soups made here. The ambiance here is great. It occupies an old home built in the early 1900's and a patio that makes you feel like home. Went one Tuesday Pasta night which used to occur weekly and still does I hope and had the best pasta since my trip to Italy. A hidden gem in downtown Phoenix.
Based upon the other reviews and word of mouth, we might need to try Cibo again. It was very underwhelming the 1st time. My favorite part was the patio. It's great, particularly when the weather permits. Love the atmosphere of the historic places in downtown Phoenix. . As far as the pizza goes, I thought Federal, Pomo, and The Parlor all taste better. Our waiter didn't help the experience either. Spilled one of our pizzas completely and was very unapologetic. . Might have just been an off night for them and/or our waiter, will probably try them again at some point.
What a great place! I yelped this restaraunt on the way to the airport. The service was speedyand the food is phenomenal. I got the funghi pizza with Italian sausage and my brother got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It was the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever tried. I only gave it four stars cause the service was a little awkward. Our waitress didn't talk much but it wouldn't be enough to prevent me from going there again. We will definitely be back!
Cute little place. Very quaint. We asked the server for pizza recommendations and was not disappointed. Just ask! Lemonade is delicious.
Great little Italian place close to the centre of Phoenix.. . I've been here a few times now and had a good experience every time. The food is fresh and the wine selection is great!. . Perfect spot for a date night or a lunch out with friends or family!
