This night club pool bar was having a D.J. Zedd was spinning for the Halloween Party last nite.. . We knew not to show up until 12 or 1, since another jock would before he comes on ( I have seen how this works before),. . To say it was cluster crowded was a understatement, they only had 2 small bars to serve 2000 people, the only table and seating available was the VIP. tables which cost thousands with bottle service!!. . It was just 2 of us so that wasn't a option.. . I was really disappointed that they didn't have any champagne just the cheap. well drinks, so I just danced on a stripper pole and made the best of it.. . This place is located in the Encore, a Wynn property.
It seems like a lot of people are dropping bad marks on XS because they are unaware of standard night club culture in Vegas. This review is more "Expectations Management 101" for those that have never been to a Vegas night club. I hadn't either until this year, but I'm hooked now and love it. . . 1. Las Vegas night clubs are all about image and building a culture of eliteness. If you dress poorly, expect to wait. If you are a group of guys, expect to wait. If you are dressed appropriately, have more girls than guys in a group and ask nicely, solid chance the bouncers will let you cut in line if those around you are in tank tops. (I've only done this at XS before. Once I asked, once a bouncer asked us.) Like most clubs, show up before 11 if you want to get in. Lines get dreadful at clubs everywhere after that. Come early and enjoy the house DJ, you know? . . 2. Unless you have a table, don't plan on finding a seat anywhere. However.... XS actually wins the award for being one of the more non-table friendly clubs. Whether outside by the pool along plant edges or inside along the walkway, most clubs don't even offer that much. That being said, XS with a famous DJ like David Guetta means about 8,000 people and zero space. So remember that if your shoes are hot as hell but will hurt like a bitch before you even make it through the Encore to the club, you might want to rethink what pair you will wear.. . 3. Do NOT leave your purse unattended unless you have a table. This has nothing to do with XS. Human nature doesn't say, "This isn't mine, so I shouldn't take it." If you want to dance and have free hands, bring a small clutch with a strap that puts the bag right under your arm pit.. . 4. Having to wait for a drink at the bar is normal. LiFE, Marquee, Drai's, and Hakkasan are the same. Again, it's a culture of eliteness and maximizing space; realistically, they can make a smaller bar to put in an extra two tables (which will rake in a solid 10K probably) since they know people will wait for a drink anyway. And at $16 a pop, it takes a lot more drinks to make $10K.. . 5. Drinks in Vegas are expensive, period. This is a Vegas-ism, not an XS-ism. I'm not a huge drinker so it doesn't take much, but if you are... I would highly recommend pre-gaming if cash is an issue. . . Since this is a review on XS... I should probably say something about XS in general, right? . This is a beautiful club. More space than Hakkasan, less space than Drai's. Dance floor is about the size of Hakkasan's.. Sound system and effects are solid, whether indoors or outside by the pool. . . XS is a little strange because you can show up dressed to the nines or with the intent of jumping around in a pool to the music. I think that might just be Sunday Night Swims, though. (I could be wrong...) Also, locals get in for free Sunday nights, I believe... . . If you need a promoter and are a group of mostly girls looking to get in for free, give Chris a text for the hook up... He will help you out. 702.722.8585 . . XS is easily one of the biggest money making clubs in this town, and I still like it much better than Marquee or Hakkasan. XS and Drai's are great ones to check out for your first Vegas club experience. Now that you know what to expect, have fun! =)
ZEDD + Vegas (XS) + Friends = Best. Night. Of Your. Life.. . Saturday night. Party poppin'. Glitzy people. It was awesome.. . The venue was huge,  amazing and just plain gorgeous. . Here's some tips: . - Buy your tickets online ahead of time. They're actually really cheap compared to the exorbitant prices at the door. ZEDD Saturday night ended up being triple digits for guys. Guys in our group only spent $35.00 by buying early. . . - Girls. Buy your tickets too. It's only $25.00 online. Your promoter can only get you in so far. A lot of people (mostly girls) were turned away at the second door where ZEDD and the other bars were because they didn't have full access to the club because they were brought in by either promoters or by their charming good looks.. . - Yes, apparently XS has two sections, there's the outer club that everyone has access to, and then there's the inner ring that is only allowed for people who paid (stamps are given out at the main entrance by security). So you're shit out of luck if you didn't buy your tickets.. . P.S. ZEDD, you are an amazing SOB. :heart:
One of my favorite clubs in Vegas!  Special thanks to our promoter Michelle who hooked us up at the last minute!  Hit her up if you need help with guestlists:  (908) 770-3570
Everything was going well until my clutch was stolen on the super crowded dance floor. As soon as I found out, we went to the entrance and asked the securities if anyone had turned it in. They were unhelpful. So immediately after I left the club, I called my bank to cancel my cards. We waited to come back to lost and found the following day. No one turned it in! After almost a day, I realized I forgot to call one of my credit card company and someone actually used my card!!! Ladies, be very careful of your belongings! It gets really crowded and you never know who is standing next to you! I learnt it the hard way! :(
Happening..crazy busy..long wait..super busy..super crowded. .worth it..... . Cover can be steep 55 green ones..
Came here for a friends birthday who loves EDM (I do not). So if you love EDM then this is the place to go. The decor is beautiful and so are the dancers! We were with a group of 8 girls who got in easily thanks to our promoter Daniel: 808) 375-3112
Being outdoors is not so bad in the summer.  Every time I came, Zedd was spinning.  One time I came, my friends and I were pushed outside.  That was lame, but whatever.  It was nicer in the water.  It was pretty hot too.  The misters were on.  2nd time around, we were in and outdoors.  The place was opened up to everyone, in and outdoors.  Time definitely went by quick when you're having fun.  My friends and I arrived so late, we started doing shots after shots after shots.  What a night...
Got presale tickets for this spot a few months ago which also happened to be Alesso's birthday. The lines were pretty long as expected which meant it's best to show up early! . . I really didn't expect Alesso's set to be so amazing but he really went beyond my expectations. Having also attended EDC this year, I'd have to say his set would be ranked among one of the top performances.. . Having been  here dozens of times, I have to say, it's still one of the goto spots every time we visit Vegas. This place is huge but usually goes beyond max occupancy if such a thing exists for Vegas nightclubs... The decor is awesome and it's probably a good idea to get a table here so you won't be so cramped with all the other patrons.. . PS: They have poker tables inside if you're in the mood to gamble while drunk.

When it comes to Vegas, this is one of my favorite clubs to head to.  Like any Vegas club XS has its pros and cons. . . Cons: . -The club ALWAYS seems to be over-crowded.  It's packed like sardines and makes going from the inside to the outside seem like an adventure.  . -They close out the inside if it is too crowded.  This definitely annoys me since I want to be inside watching the Dj.  . . Pros: . -Nice set up. They have a fairly large inside, two bars, one on each side.  Plus, onthe outside they have pools, two other large bar areas, and more restrooms.  Some clubs only have one restroom area which can make for long lines, I'm looking at you Surrender.  . -They always have great Djs here.  No matter which weekend or which day, there is always someone worth seeing.  . -They have night swim in the summer.  This is probably one of my favorite things to do in Vegas.  It's basically one large pool party where everyone is having fun together.  During regular nightclub events, talking to people may be a bit more difficult, but at night swim everyone is much friendly and open to mingling. . . All in all I love XS and I always look forward to coming here.
My 900th review is dedicated to the best night I had in 2014! I went here with my girlfriends to see David Guetta and had a blast. Beautiful nightclub and a lot of attractive people here ;). This club is pretty big, especially the outside area. I read somewhere this club was influenced by the curves of the human body... sounds kinda silly but once you see the club and the layout... it makes sense, lol.. . Getting drinks from the bar was pretty easy, as the bar is big and bartenders are fast. If you go with a group of girls, find a promoter and score free drink tickets! My girlfriends and I were literally on the dancefloor for 3 hours straight, no joke! All sober, no bar or bathroom breaks! I couldn't believe time passed by that fast. The club had good air conditioning, which is important...it kept us going lol. . . As for leaving the club with a taxi, expect to wait a long time. We saw a huge line that pretty much crowded the entrance... seeing that we decided to walk back to the Cosmo which took us 20 minutes so we can grub on our 5AM pizza :) . . XS always grabs the best DJs for every weekend. Definitely can't wait to come back here and go loca.
