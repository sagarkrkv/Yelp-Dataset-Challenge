This used to be our favorite hotel to stay in. Not anymore. My girlfriend and I came out to Las Vegas to celebrate her birthday. I booked the room a month in advance and everything seemed like it was gonna be a good stay. We were thrilled about the discount we got on the room since we were part of their Grazie loyalty program.. . Fast forward to check in:. . We get into the room and I rush to the restroom. When you gotta go, you gotta go. I look at the toilet and there are dried up urine stains on the porcelain toilet. . . I called the front desk right away and made it clear that this was unacceptable. For an hour I got bounced around from room to room and every room had disgusting and half-done cleaning jobs. I was passed on from customer service reps to security personnel to finally a housekeeping manager who FINALLY informed me that they are looking into it.. . Word of advice: if you don't value the money you spend on a "nice" vacation then by all means stay at the palazzo where sanitation and customer service are the last of their priorities
Great service, great hotel. Only problem I had was the clock radio was set at 6 am and I could not turn it off or unplug it.  Nice big rooms with nice big price.
When my mom checked in to the Venetian, they told her we were in the Palazzo and they didn't have any rooms left in the actual Venetian hotel (Palazzo is part of the Venetian) but that was just fine with us because the suites were amazing! We had great city and mountain views, big bedrooms, a large sunken living room with a couch, office area, and the bathrooms were awesome as well (with TV's!). We had a great time and loved this location. I'd definitely recommend it!
Best vegas hotel experience I've ever had. I go to vegas at least twice a year and can't believe I have just now found this jewel of a place.  Service is top notch, hotel rooms are first class too. Food and beverages were also very generous considering your in vegas. I didn't see one smoker the entire time I was there. It's worth the price if you really want a great experience! . Decent walk to the convention center and right across the street from the mall and the monorail
Customer service is top of the line. The staff is very kind and try their best to assist you. The rooms were also extremely nice and well maintained. I will definitelty be going back here.
Have stayed here a few times and it wasnt bad until my last experience. We got to our room and found wet dirty womens underwear inside the bed covers. Called front desk but they didnt seem to be beothered and just asked us to move to another room. The second room had a view if you call that an upgrade. But we stayed over the weekend and the first day i understand we forgot to remover our do not disturb so they didnt clean our room, second day we slept in and removed our do not disturb after noon or around 1 pm. We came back to our hotel at night and nothing had been cleaned, do they not check if guests sleep in? Called to ask if they can change our sheets but instead just dropped off fresh sheets and left.... Not a great experience and wont be returning here ever again
Came here again in may 2014 and noticed they raised the resort fee.. . I really like the palazzo I wonder if there is a way to wAve the resort fee
This is a really lovelyhotel and casino, definitely the nicest place I have ever stayed.. . We had a Luxury Suite (the most basic) and it was huge. We wouldn't have needed anything bigger. We didn't bother with a strip view booking and it actually ended up ok as we were overlooking the Wynn golf course with a view of the mountains, which I think is nicer. Everything was clean (though we did find a stray sock under the bed that wasn't ours!) and all staff we spoke to were very nice.. . They have a baggage hold and we left our baggage on check out day with no problems.. . The casino is small but I thought it was the nicest of those we visited on the strip, plus it connects directly to the Venetian if you want something bigger.. . There is a Walgreens next door (though you can't keep anything in the mini bar so don't buy any cold snacks that will need to be stored) and Fashion Show Mall is just across the road. It's not a far walk to major casinos such as Bellagio and Ceasars.. . I would definitely stay again, I don't think any other hotels on the strip can compare in terms of location and value for money.
