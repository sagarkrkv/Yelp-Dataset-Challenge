This is my first time writing a review but I had to mention what a terrible experience we had during the last week of December 2012. We waited for close to an hour to check in, thanks to the long line of foreign tourists, just to hear that our room was not ready and we would have to wait another hour. There was really no place to lounge around with our luggage until then, but we managed to find a tiny bench. After an hour I called the front desk, simply to be informed that our room was still not ready! I had to yell at three different people at the front desk to finally get the room I requested when making my reservation (two queen beds). All in all, it was an exhausting experience. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.
The rooms are a bit dated. The service at the Carnegie Deli in the lobby is atrocious.  The amenities in the room service very basic and nothing to write home about.  Beds are comfortable but they use an occupancy sensor on the air conditioning so you will come back to a warm room.  The worst part for a traveller in this day is that the Internet service is unusably slow.  Shame that they skimp on the easy things.
Had occasion to stay here recently due to a having an evening planned there. First of all, this place is showing its age a bit. The Front Desk staff were OK, a little rushed and not too friendly. Getting to your room here is a hassle. I'm a bit resentful of being forced to drag our bag through the entire casino to get to the elevators. I'm also resentful of paying $252.00 for an old room and getting shanked for a $25.00 "resort fee". This is just a straight rip off, a "because we can F*ck You" fee.
We checked in on Friday and checked out on Sunday.  The room was clean and nice. LOVED the bedding, pillows etc. SOUND PROOF we slept like zombies as couldn't hear a peep from any of the adjoining rooms. Nice place to put away your things dressers, closet space plentiful. Didn't appreciate the Wi-Fi though. Dined at the Burger place, Samba's LOVED it! Great food, prices and service the little semi-circle bar was cute and the bartender made drinks that knocked us off our stools ta boot. Left Japonais as they were a little negligent in the service dept. Went to LOVE by Circque de Soleil and it was fab! It's a haul to the elevators though and we didn't have time for the pool but it looked very inviting. Overall very nice stay could use more attention to service in the restaurants by the hostesses and the servers. Loved the location as well.
Wow! So all I can say is that I was thoroughly impressed with my most recent stay at the Mirage Hotel & Casino! Talk about receiving world class customer service! I recently booked just a one night stay and upon arriving I was greeted by a friendly gentleman in training at the Vip MLife members line. My expectations where exceeded by far! The check in process was easier than ever! I booked a king room on a high floor and boy was it worth it! The views in the towers facing the strip are breath taking! Watching the fire show outside of my window was fantastic! All the amenities were very nice as well as the bed was extremely comfortable! I would definitely stay here again!
When I checked in, my room was not ready. I called the front desk and they said they would send someone up to clean it. An hour passes by and no one shows up. They offered to give me a smaller room. No thanks. I mentioned it to them again, and they accused me of leaving the privacy indicator on the door. I didn't. Avoid this place. Dated rooms. Awful service.
when i checked in on a saturday evening the front desk staff were very polite and helpful.  they did a good job.. . my room was clean when i arrived.  the room looked nice and presentable.  the tv, bed and furniture were nice.  and after being in my room after a few minutes i realized i would be hearing the mirage volcano/fire show through the evening because i could see and hear the show from my room window.. . the workout room was nice and had a lot of equipment to get a great workout in.  i didn't have any problems during my stay.  for the price i paid was the quality of room and service i received.
Was so excited to stay here but unfortunately not the best experience.. . PROS: Our check in went smoothly and the desk agent, Arthur, was great. Room was a decent size and clean. Check out was very fast. . CONS:  Room was very hot and humid and remained so for our entire stay. About half of our lights worked and the wIfi wouldn't connect. After calling the front desk 3 times for help with the wifi, we finally got it working but it was awfully slow and kept disconnecting. BLT double charged my card for a meal we ate and I'm still waiting for my refund. The tram was out of service our entire stay. Our television didn't work and our hallway was littered with the same wine glasses and room service trays for 3 days even though housekeeping passed by them daily. . Now, here's the absolute worst part of our stay.......the cocktail service is HORRENDOUS!! We played the big wheel for over 45 minutes one evening without receiving one beverage. Every time we saw a server and tried to ask for a drink, we were told it wasn't her section and they would send someone which never happened. In our 4 night stay, we didn't recieve a single beverage while on the casino floor, yet at nearly all the other casinos we spent time in we had grear cocktail service. . . Don't think I'll be back to the Mirage again.
We didn't stay in the Mirage's hotel but we did get to spend some timein their casino. The casino itself was well organized and they had some really unique slot machines. The atmosphere here was laid-back, and not once we're we harassed by the staff like at some of the other hotels.. . In the end we wish we could have seen a show here, but the lobby was gorgeous, and we thoroughly enjoyed spending some time here.
I've stayed here many times over the years and the Mirage has gone from being the top shelf hotel to being a good hotel.  With newer hotels being built and the usual wear and tear, The Mirage is now somewhat of a bargain due to its prime location.  The rooms are still nice and the casino has a lot of variety in the games offered, but it cannot compare to Encore, The Venetian, or Aria.
I had a terrible experience with both, the Mirage Group Housing staff and the Front Desk staff.  I had a room block of about 30 rooms for my company, and the Group Housing department for the hotel was the most unorganized and unhelpful staff I have encountered during all of our events this year.  For starters, they couldn't seperate our sub-blocks out, which is a problem I've never encountered with any other hotel. This made it incredibly difficult to find the egregious errors that they had made when I sent over my final staff list.  The person I worked with in Group Housing had left "placeholders" on the final reservation list, when I had told her that the staff list and reservation lists should look identical. They didn't set up a master bill, which I had requested weeks in advance; and didn't find out wasn't done until my staff began to arrive and check in. . . To top it all off, I went over to the Mirage (I was staying at The Venetian), to file a complaint with a manager, and the front desk told me that there was no one, other than the front desk manager that I could speak to.  They were most unhelpful and didn't have any additional manager contacts that they could realease. Or so I was told.. . All of these problems were nonexistant with my room block of 15 at The Venetian; which is where our company will be entertaining the idea of taking our large housing block for next year's event.
Great deal on this room. We got room for $65 per night plus $50 dining credit. I confirmed this at Check in but yet it was bit applied at checkout until I had to call and ask for it!! $25 'resort fee' but the gym is included and is nice. Pool is nice too and lots of dining options. Pillow and bed were GREAT but shower sucked.
Been to vegas several times. Stayed in a different hotel each time, but this was definitely my favorite. Hotel is amazing. Rooms are fab and casinos are great. Highly recommend.
I always wanted to stay at the Mirage.  It is in a great location on the strip.  we stayed 3 nights last week.  the room was nice, comfy bed, nice views of the strip.  But the Casino area wasn't friendly at all.  the dealers of the games were so angry looking, never a smile or laugh. no talking orfacial expressions at all.  it was as though they hated their jobs and could care less about making it a fun experience for the players.  I did have one good experience with a dealer, he was great,  friendly and fun.  Thanks Carl!  But that was it.  after the first day of a  not so fun casino floor we decided to try some nearby  casinos.  they were much better.   I did play at the Mirage several more times but it was more of the same.  Super lame lame dealers.   I wouldn't stay at The Mirage again.
The room is nice, 21st fl. Strip view.  Really comfortable bed.  A few  things bother me:  1. The tile floor at entry and bathroom is really slick if you aren't wearing shoes or if wet.  2.  There are some plumbing issues... the shower head is a bit lame and disappointing and the sink seems to only like to give hot water.  3.  The wifi is slow.  4. Service is somewhat sparse.  5. Drinks and food are really overpriced.  So fairly comfortable room, but probably won't stay here again.  I think other properties do a better job.
