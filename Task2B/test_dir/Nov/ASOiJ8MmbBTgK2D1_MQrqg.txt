My wife and I celebrated my birthday here and I noted in my reservations that we would like to be seated by the window to enjoy the water show from the Bellagio across the street and they accommodated us perfectly!  The view was amazing and the service was quick!  Actually too quick, lol. The food was delicious, drinks were ok and the desert was ok as well. Great romantic spot for all occasions.
This is a great place in vegas to have a romantic dinner, right across the Bellagio fountains. The service was great. I have been here a few times and the food was always delicious, steak cooked just like we wanted it. Very decent prices for the quality of the food and the set up.
THIS RESTAURANT IS AMAZING!! At first I was a little worried to eat here. I knew I would be so disappointed if the food wasn't good for the prices. I was so wrong. I have been coming to vegas for years but always ate at buffets or just fast food. Being it was my 30th birthday me and my boyfriend wanted something romantic. . . We called the restaurant to make a reservation for the next day. They were very polite over the phone. The next day we were running late for dinner so we called to let them know. When we got to the elevator we were greeted then getting off the elevator a girl walked us over to check in. The lady who checked us in was very nice and told me happy birthday. We were seated at the window with a view of the cosmo hotel and the water show. It was beautiful.. . Our waiter came over and gave us the menu and asked if we wanted water. We also ordered a glass of wine. When we were waiting for our food they brought us bread and butter and something that was white I think he said cauliflower something lol. It was amazing. For our appetizer we got the pork belly. OMG it was so amazing! Then we got our food. I ordered the roasted farm raised chicken and my boyfriend ordered the beef wellington. They were perfect portions for us and so amazing. The staff was very very attentive without being too much. They kept filling my water which was nice being I was a little hungover from the night before. At the end of the night they gave me a chocolate mouse that had happy birthday written on the plate. Everything from the staff, the views and the food was perfect. I'm so beyond happy with my experience there and will definitely be coming back for another occasion. Our bill was $195 and worth every penny. Thank you for making my birthday perfect!
Want to have an unforgettable dinner and taste the best food in vegas? This is the place you need to make a reservation in. . . Located on the actual Eiffel Tower in the Paris hotel, this restaurant is an icon in the strip. You are taken in an elevator by a hostess and brought to the bar area of the restaurant where you check in for your table. . . If you call to make reservations be sure to request the fountain view. At night during the weekends the Bellagio fountains play every 15 minutes and you get to experience this great view from your table as you dine. . . The service is impeccable. Once you check in you will wait a few minutes and you can enjoy one of their signature drinks at the bar. . . The setting is low lighting and the noise is average. It's very cozy once you're inside. Dress code is implemented and this is a restaurant where you want to go looking your best. . . When you are finally  sitting be sure to enjoy the spectacular view that the location offers. . . All the waiters are very knowledgable of the menu and based on your cravings will recommend you a great plate. . . After placing your order they will come with a big tray of bread and you can chose which you'll like to eat from the variety that they'll bring. . . This occasion I had the beef Wellington and wow!!!! Made to perfection. The outside pastry was crunchy and the filet came medium rare inside. The flavors of the food are out of this world and you never want your plate to be emptied. . . For dessert we ordered the chocolate souffle. It wasn't the best we've had but it was pretty good. It was our anniversary dinner and they surprised us with a complimentary chocolate mouse that was very good. . . Our second time in Vegas and we HAD to make reservations here again. We're looking forward to going back and again having our signature plates in the best restaurant this city has!
All things considered, the Eiffel Tower Restaurant has my vote for best restaurant in Las Vegas.  . . Is it hands down the best food?  With so many to choose from, it's not a definitive yes... but, it's in the discussion, and we're probably splitting hairs at that point anyway.  . . Besides, add in the service, setting, and the spectacular view, and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant wins.
My mom surprised me in Vegas for my 30th birthday and took me here for a FABULOUS birthday dinner. I didn't even know this place existed! You take an elevator up and the views are fabulous. It was very impressive!. . The food is just melt-in-your-mouth amazing, the service is top notch without being stuffy, and they really went above and beyond to make it a very special night. We were continually brought bread, waters refilled, and even given a great tasting cauliflower soup (sounds a little weird but tasted awesome), compliments of the chef. The food was delicious and the service was exceptional. The waitress was so on top of her game, it was probably the best service we ever had. She was great, yet wasn't stuffy -- she was very personable and made us feel comfortable. When my mom made the reservations, she asked them to include roses on the table. They had a dozen of the most beautiful red roses ever -- they are seriously perfect and still thriving! I got to take them home in the vase, and the waitress provided a great gift bag to make carrying them out easier. The are full and open, still looking and smelling as beautiful today as they did this past weekend at the restaurant! She also brought out a birthday dessert, in addition to the delicious souffle that my mom loved. My mom also asked them to bring out a jewelry gift she had gotten me, with dessert -- they brought it out on a platter and had written Happy Birthday on the plate. They didn't skimp on anything here -- everything was fabulous! It was the greatest dining experience and they helped my mom make my birthday truly special and unforgettable!
There are soooo many restaurants in Vegas.... Do yourself a favor and skip Eiffel Tower. Filet should be buttery and not the texture of a top sirloin or a leather shoe. Potatoes were perfectly cold. There were so many employees and noone seemed to be organized. Try Strip Steak
Random info: Tasting Menu is $125, Wine paring optional, additional $79. Average individual entree ranges between $50~$80. The elevator to the restaurant is located in the middle of the Paris casino. . . Ambiance: Excellent. In terms of view of the Bellagio fountain this is probably the best place to dine! (Be sure to ask for a good table if you come here for the view ;).) . . Food: Good. The first time I came here with my girlfriend we had lamp chop and a steak. I thought those dishes were quite average. The second time I came here with my clients, and we had the chief's tasting menu which I thought it was definitely one of the better tasting menu I had come across. The Foie Gras, which is duck liver was amazing! . . Parking: Good. Free parking if you don't mind the walking. On the other hand valet is only $3~5 bucks depends on how much you want to tip. I always valet when I'm in Vegas it is so freaking convenient! . . Service: Excellent. First of all there are people greet you right at the elevator, and will escort you to the restaurant. If you are having the tasting menu, your utensils will be swapped out for clean ones after every course. And oh, beware they have restroom attendants, be sure to bring some cash for tips. Water is always filled on time, sometimes the VP/manager will walk around and personally make sure everything is ok. . . Conclusion: Hands down one of the best view in Vegas! Good food. Over the top service. A good place to impress a date/client. Dinner for two, expect the bill to be $200 if you order off the menu. $280 ~ $450 if you are getting the tasting menu.
View is AMAZING!  We did not have a reservation and they said the wait was going to be 30 minutes, but it was only about 10.  The lobster appetizer and the scallop appetizer my table had was very delicious.  I had the crusted salmon with a side of green beans and it was very good.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and crusted very well.  The green beans had a lemon foam on top that was a neat touch.  They also bring out complimentary desserts (5 small desserts) that were very good.  Make sure and get a view of the Bellagio fountain, they will go off many times during dinner and it is a fantastic view.
Hubby and I came here on a whim for lunch while I was taking a break from a conference I was attending and were completely blown away by the beautiful atmosphere, food and customer. . . We were seated right next to the window so we had a beautiful scenic view of the strip. I ordered the chicken Parmesan with vegetables and potato scallops. It was cooked very well. Hubby ordered lamb burger which was cooked well but not crazy about it. One of the best parts of the menu was the dessert! Creme brulee was absolutely amazing! We were also given complimentary passion fruit candy and chocolate truffles. . . Our waiter made sure we taken care of and the buss boy also made sure our water glasses were filled.
We had a reservation for 9:30pm on Saturday night. We arrived 15 minutes early and were seated right away. We had a table overlooking the Bellagio fountains and the Las Vegas Strip. The view was priceless. The servers were quick and attentive. If you are thinking of proposing to your significant other this is the place. Three couples got engaged the 90 minutes we were there. For dinner we had the rack of lamb which was delicious. Entrees are about 35-70 and cocktails are around 20 a drink. Good food, great scenery.
I was not expecting this.  My girlfriend and I sort of fell into the idea of having a French  meal during this trip to Vegas when we saw a travelzoo deal for another restaurant.  That planted the bug in our taste buds, so we started looking and doing comparisons and in the end, had to decide between here and another French restaurant (I forget which).  I was worried about this one because it looked so cheesy.  French restaurant in the Paris hotel which French people probably hate America for building, at a restaurant in the Eiffel Tower, which French people probably hate America for building.  I just didn't think they would do it right.  This is the middle of the desert for pete's sake.. . Stupid me.  Firstly, Vegas has some of the best chefs in America, so naturally the food would be good.  But it wasn't just good - it was spectacular.  Every bite was delicious.  And the restaurant has more to offer than just delicious food.  It has beautiful views of the Bellagio fountains.  I don't understand why anyone comes here any other time but at night.  You get the lights from Bellagio, Aria, Paris and Caesar's, and you get the fountain shows throughout your meal.  Further, our server was French (so I guess I was wrong about the French hating us for bastardizing their city).  He was gracious and helpful and couldn't have provided more perfect service.. . Shame on me, but I don't remember what my girlfriend got.  I think she got the sauteed snapper without the bacon (vegetarian), but it might have been the Pacific salmon.  I got the braised short ribs.  I was on a bit of a short ribs kick this year - getting in nearly everywhere we visited, and I think I got it like 3 times in New Orleans in April.  This was, if not the best, then top 2 or 3.  It was to die for.  The sauce was incredible, the vegetables were perfect, and the meat was just right.. . We ended our meal by splitting a creme brulee.  Unfortunately, still not as good as my girlfriend's creme brulee and why she doesn't market it to restaurants is beyond me.  That said, as far as non-girlfriend made creme brulee's go, then again, this was the best or at worst, second best.. . This is Vegas - if you come to a restaurant like this, be prepared to leave with a second mortgage, a payday loan, and maybe even an organ or two after you sold them to pay the bill.  But, when you choose right in Vegas, its well worth the money.  This was one of those meals.
I came here with my girlfriend we knew up front that this was going to be expensive but we put it in the back of our minds and enjoyed it for it was. The place is an awesome restaurant the views are spectacular and the vibe is very romantic. The food was delicious. I ordered the beef Wellington which I've never had before it was really good. My girl ordered the steak and said it was the best steak shes ever had which means alot because we've had some really good steak in Chicago. The breads they came passing around were really good too. Bill was around $250 with tip which was pretty good cause we also tried like 3 sides. Afterwards we took the elevator to the top of the Eiffel tower which ended up being a catastrophe cause my girl is terrified of heights which I didnt know lol. She ended up gripping the wall for dear life she literally had tears in her eyes so we didnt stay long. Overall very nice memory though.
Eiffel Tower is a delightful restaurant. You arrive via elevator, up through the "Eiffel Tower" structure in the middle of the Paris casino complex. The elevator opens directly into the kitchen pass, which is a unique and rather cool touch I've never seen before. Once you enter the dining room, a dim room with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the strip; you're greeted warmly. This is one of the few high-end restaurants I've visited where even a family with a small baby (admittedly a quiet, well-dressed baby) was welcomed by the hostesses. . . Our family had made a reservation several months ago, and had specifically asked for a table near the windows. We were given a delightful 3-top with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. Our service team was quiet and well-trained, although they did not quite meet the same level of service that one experiences at Twist. (No holding of chairs for ladies, etc.) My spouse suggested that I might be nit-picking when I complained that they only utilized their crumb scrapers at the end of our meal, rather than after each course. . . The food itself was classical and elegant. We started our meal with a cauliflower creme, sent out by the chef as an amuse bouche. Rich, "roasty" and delicious. My son ordered the filet mignon, which was perfectly prepared and delicious. My entree was black cod served on a bed of cauliflower couscous. The fish fell apart when I touched it with my fork- it was tender, moist and very well done. Easily the best non-salmon fish entree I've ever had. My spouse ordered the Wellington, which he was not thrilled with. It was prepared well and he had no specific critique...it just didn't suit him. For sides, we shared the brown butter spaetzl and the green beans. The former was delicious (if a bit on the oily side) while the latter were...just green beans. I'd suggest you be more adventurous if you dine here. . . For dessert, we ordered chocolate cake and apple strudel. My spouse loved the apple dish. I found the chocolate cake to be too rich to finish; which is saying something, considering that I am a die-hard chocoholic and the portion was small. The management also sent over a lovely artists palate of assorted sorbet, with a side of berries. They explained that this was an apology for a drunken diner seated nearby that had to be asked to leave. Considering that we had not even noticed an incident occurring in this very quiet dining room, I think this speaks volumes to the staffs discretion when handing front of the house issues. Honestly? The sorbet (Raspberry, Mango, Green Apple, Creme, and Chocolate) were my favorite desserts. I would order that again in a heartbeat. . . In short? Paris is now my second favorite Las Vegas restaurant (running behind Twist) and is recommended, should you find yourself in that part of the country.
