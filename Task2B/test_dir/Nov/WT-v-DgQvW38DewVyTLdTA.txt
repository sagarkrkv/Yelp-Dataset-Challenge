as some people may have said, i think it has been remodeled and the rooms were PERFECT. for paying 50 bucks a night, it was almost as if we were staying in a hilton honestly. . . the pool is alright.. i wouldn't swim there because there are much nicer pool parties else where so who cares. and the casino is aight and they have lots of arcades and food places upstairs. . . if ur young and going out at night, just beware that there are sometimes people sitting outside near the outside of the hotel building rooms but usually there are multiple entrances so you can avoid them. and just be smart about partying if thats what you're there to do.
Our expectations weren't that this place was going to be a high end stay. But, we did expect it to be clean and functional. Potato chips were left on the chair. The sink drained slow. The shower faucet couldn't be shut off completely without using a lot of force. The shower drain was clogged - in the time it took to shower, the soapy water was ankle high.  Called the desk three times (9:00 AM the first time) requesting repair only to be told that they had lots of maintenance calls and they would send someone as soon as possible. Finally around 7:00PM someone came. . . When I called, the lady said for the inconvenience they would comp two nites. At checkout, they asked for the persons name. We didn't have it. They apologized that all they could do was discount the resort fee - a whopping $26!!!!. . Never again!!
Thought I was going to have a wonderful room. I walk into my room and my room is filthy. It looks like no one has swept. Vacuumed the room or washed the bathroom. Not my favorite choice
Do not compare Las Vegas to Reno evvvvvvvvver!!! This Circus Circus in Las Vegas was so much nicer then Renos!!! The breakfast buffet was bomb too.. . I want to add there are different towers and such. We stayed in the west tower 30th floor and the room was awesome. Bathroom was big. Everything was clean and nice. Renovated rooms. Flat screens n such. But who goes to Vegas to watch TV anyways LOL.. . . We were going to stay at the manor motor lodge across the street but it was only $10 more a day to upgrade to a tower so we did it. The lodge looked a little run down from the outside but I have no clue how they look inside..
If I could give zero stars, that is how I would rate this place. I have been in 3 rooms, due issues during my two day stay here. My first room smelled like someone just cook Chinese food in it. The second room smelled like somebody had been smoking cigarettes in it all night and I found a bedbug in my bed so gross.  Some people say to stay in cheap places because in Vegas all you need is a place to sleep. I was not a believer and still aren't.  I will never do this again I will pay for a very expensive room next time.
This place is a scam. The machines took your money but wouldn't print out any tickets to be redeemed we wasted half an hour twiddling our thumbs farting around avoid at all cost. SCAM
So I was a little scared to stay here due to all of the bad reviews and because it was so cheap.  I'm guessing most of the bad reviews are for the super "cheap" rooms in the manor.  I booked a room in the casino tower on a non smoking floor.  I opted for the king suite room which was HUGE and unlike other reviewers said it did not smell like smoke at all and i'm very sensitive to that.  It was very clean and looked updated. The TV had a lot of channels more then most hotels do. Only downside I had was there was no fridge, but it was so cheap and nice that wasn't an issue.  This place is awesome for kids so much to do!  All of the staff I encountered were very nice and helpful, check in was easy and express check out was nice as well.  So do yourself a favor stop griping and try staying in one of the tower rooms its not much more then the super cheap $20 rooms.  I paid $42 for a king suite which had a huge bathroom and lots of room for the little one to run around.  Parking was also easy and felt safe.  Don't stay here and then complain about kids...that's what this hotel is for so get over it and stay somewhere else if you don't like it lol Will definitely be returning soon :)
I dont have anything negative to say at all about this hotel... I love it and its great for kids and family. Right when u walk in they greet you and welcome you. Its a very reasonable price. They have everything!! Circus shows, buffet, games, casino, fitness center, pool, small rollercoaster the adventure dome. The prices on food are great we love going to the garden grill for two people to eat is less than $30.... they have a mcdonalds and minigames. The only thing is that its far from the strip but its ok they have shuttle busses and bus. We always bring our car we live inS.D soo its extremely close by..... rooms are nice as well and have many to choose from. This is my second stay here soo we do love it.... love it here...
Circus Circus is closer to three stars than it is to two, but I can't give it a full 3 because there were a few things that needed to be improved in my most humble opinion. First, the good. The room we stayed in was pretty and clean and didn't smell like smoke at all. We stayed in the Casino Tower on the 8th floor in a non-smoking room, and even though we were in a non-smoking section (we always stay in non-smoking no matter where we stay in Vegas) we were glad that it didn't smell like smoke like other places "Non-Smoking" towers.. . Now the bad: . . Casino Main Entrance valet- there was like only two dudes. Took  about 15 minutes to get the car because these two poor guys were taking turns parking cars and bringing cars back. One or two more guys would go a long way. The entrance where the hotel registration was didn't have this problem.. . Ice Machine- It wasn't hot this past weekend. Ice machine on my floor was out of ice TWICE. No ice coming out and the thing said "Making Ice". We had to go down a floor to get ice. Not cool.. . The Room- Although the room was pretty, one major design flaw. The sink and mirror are on the INSIDE OF THE RESTROOM, NOT THE OUTSIDE, like other hotels, so if someone is dropping a deuce or taking a shower, you are assed out and have to wait to do things like paint your face, brush your teeth, shave or any other kinds of things you'd do while someone else is showering, which could be awkward if the person you are in the room with isn't your significant other. . . The Bed- It folded like a taco when I lied down in it which means it was worn, even though the white linen was nice and crisp and the duvet was neatly pressed and damn near new.. . Overall, it wasn't a BAD experience, but it was not a GREAT experience. I'd probably give it at least one more shot.
It took a long while but we finally figured out what was still old-school about Vegas and it's the manner at Circus Circus a three level row of hotel rooms behind Circus Circus without ballet that has self parking and you don't need to use elevators this truly is the right place for my father 83 years old still smoking still Kickin ass and still playing slot machines like there's no tomorrow thank God you're still a piece of Vegas that reminds us of what Vegas used to be
This place is still really okay. See my last review, every bit of it still holds but one update.. . Update: the sneaky underhanded "Las Vegas resort fee" (charged at all Strip hotels, I'm told, but amount varies between hotels) - $14.50 for one night stay as of 10/2014 (up from $11 one year earlier)
So my family and I stayed here because there is a three year old in our party and we wanted him to be entertained. This hotel is older but still quite charming. The rooms are clean and the place doesn't smell to bad of smoke like most. There are tons of families and kids so be aware. But the deals are good. The circus acts were pretty cool clowns juggling, acrobats and the likes. Games like at the fair. We didn't go in the adventuredome because he was too little. But we tried their pizza it was not terrible.. Overall it was a good stay. And hey pay the money check in early. It is worth it!!
Definately an older property ,   If you are with children there is a lit to do here.  The rooms are clean and quiet,   There is the ell of cigarette smoke everywhere.    The Casino is dirty and the employees are not held to high standards of uniforms and customer service.
Where to begin. When you first walk in you will smell the stench of cigarette smoke along with the grim darkness of the place. They put the hotel lobby in the far end of the building. I guess they figure people will gamble before reaching the hotel lobby. Kids everywhere and the people that stay here are pretty ghetto. I felt a little unsafe here and this coming from someone who's lived in not so great areas. I stayed in skyway tower. Room was clean but TV was old and not a flat screen.  Only reason I came here was because it was so cheap on weekends compared to everywhere else. The WiFi is wireless and painfully slow. The Keurig coffee machine made awful coffee, I'm guessing because it never got cleaned. Housekeeping never emptied garbage. It took forever to go from my room to the strip because the layout here is so misguided. I just read today that on Saturday about 5:30 am a woman was shot and was dead when police arrived. It happened near Circus Circus. What sane parents would bring their kids to this awful place or Vegas for that matter. Vegas is way overrated but if you have to stay for convention or a night then go to tropicana.
This place was dirty, found some pizza crusts behind a cabinet and a used kurieg cups in the coffee maker still.. Also went to Vince Neils Tatuado and ordered the breakfast special, the waitress came out with our breakfasts and I asked about where's the toast? she replied back to me we only bring that if the guest requests it? I was in shock! Clearly stated eggs, pancakes, sausage or bacon and toast. . . My suggestion is spend your money elsewhere, and pretty much just avoid this place, I know I will be in the future. . . proof of nasty pizza behind the tv console. http://i286.photobucket.com/albums/ll95/jubjubrsx/IMAG0692_zps6613c869.jpg
Let's see on the minus side:. 1. Only 5 minutes of (free) circus performers every 45 minutes. (Dangerously over crowded at each show). 2. Small overpriced rooms. 3. Noisy pipes (?) at night. 4. Big pink light (my room faced the pink adventure dome) coming in the window. 5. North end of the strip, far from the cool part of LV. . 6. Expensive restaurants (even the cheap buffet was still $20 a person). 7. Far from the monorail. 8. $4.00 for a bottle of water. 9. No fridge, no microwave in room. 10. My kid who was two inches too tall at age 8, for the kid rate, had to pay the adult rate of $29 for an all day pass on the kiddie rides. . 11. Wifi was non-functional. 12. "Closet" cubby, (no door) was too low to hang my long coat without dragging it on the floor. . . On the plus:. 1. Free parking . 2. Buffet food was good. 3. Furniture was fairly new. . Conclusion: there are just better places to stay in LV for the same money.
New tower room was updated.Great price for a cheap vegas trip.Pizza was excellent. Tanisha in Vip took care of me and was extremely professional. The place is older but gives you the old vegas feel. Pit boss at the crap table very professional and made the loss easier to bare..... For a cheap stay over.. This is your place if you in can deal with kids.
We found a deal online so we went with it.  Stayed three nights and from start to finish had a wonderful time!  The guy who checked us in [Joseph] was awesome!!  We have been going to Vegas for 6 years now and this was the first time we actually had a view of the strip!  The room was spacious and comfortable. It's a bit outdated, but we would stay here again.  We don't have young kids, but never felt like we were out of place, this hotel definitely caters to families...so if you don't like kids, do not stay here!  The Midway was SO much fun!  Carnival games, shows and goodies!  Looking forward to bringing our grandkids here.  It's almost at the very end of the strip, probably the only down side.  It's a little spread out also, it wouldn't be a comfortable walk to the pool from the West Tower (quite a trek). Vince Neil has a restaurant here, Tatuado, food was amazing! Will def stay here again, we never got to enjoy the rides!
This place is a dump. Since there is an amusement park in the casino they let everyone bring their 5-6 kids with them to the casino. The place badly needs refurbishment. Little kids get in the way as they stand with their parents while they are gambling. That being said, my 22 year old daughter was carded when she was next to her friend at a slot machine. Parking logistics is a nightmare.  You can tell that the gamblers here are not high rollers. Best advice. ...........STAY AWAY FROM CIRCUS CIRCUS! !!!!
Wish there is an zero star rating! If you don't want to sleep at all then stay there, because the loud AC sound like industry fan will constantly wake you up!
