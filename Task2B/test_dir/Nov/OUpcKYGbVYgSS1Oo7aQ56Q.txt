This place, despite being off the strip (as it is in downtown Las Vegas) is a favorite of mine. Love watching the sharks in the shark tank while in the pool. Rooms have always been clean and modern for us when we've visited.  We ate happy hour at both the Chart house and Cadillac Mexican restaurant. LOVE the Cadillac happy hour food and drink specials.. This place rocks! Chart house had ok  happy hour food specials, but great ambiance as you're looking into this enormous aquarium that reaches up to the ceiling. The Chocolate Box was worth it and needed - I picked up amaretto flavored and other truffles after our long trip to Vegas.  We've stayed 3 times in the past, probably will come back to treat ourselves to a Vic and Anthony's visit, a fine dining option in the casino. Doesn't get any better especially with the reasonably priced room rates. Definitely preferred over staying at the stratosphere, which is where we went to on our second night.
I love the golden nugget. I'm glad I had a good deal on the carson tower deluxe. I absolutely love the shark tank slide. the only thing was bummer is the shark tank slide i should have checked in a bit early to go on it, but next time i will come earlier.
Shark tank was great, even though it was too cold to go out and actually use the pool during our visit. Staff was friendly and attentive. I was worried that housekeeping was going to hate us, we had been on a cruise for a week then driven up to Vegas and had 6 bags and I was trying to find things in each of them. I did try to pick up after myself, but at the same time was exhausted and just wanted to go have fun. They picked up and kept the place cleaned. We stayed in the Carson Tower and had asked for two queen beds or one king. I like the extra bed to put things on but the hotel was nearly full when we booked so they booked us a two queen room. We checked in she let us know they only had a two bed room and could change us the next day if we wanted (6 bags.....) Got upstairs and was hugely disappointed to find it was two DOUBLE beds not queen, we are not big people we are both under 6ft and pretty average sized but come on 2 people in a double bed? Went to ask about the King room the next to get told they are sold out .. REALLY???? so I booked my room through you not a booking agent 4 weeks ago and I am stuck with 2 double beds? . . The tub was a little weird it kind of curves at the middle of the tub (like a u shape) so you get off balance if you step to the side ( I was sober and our friends said the same of their room) . . The toilet- now remember we have been on a cruise for a week so used to VERY loud toilets, dear lord the thing in the hotel scared me half to death- we were there fro drag racing I am used to loud that thing is powerful enough to suck down a small child!. and the lighting in the room is well DARK. . Over I love the place, just not the bathroom and the lighting, and will not be leaving the front desk next time until they put us in a QUEEN or KING sized bed. . . and I don't base my review on Starbucks-but seriously the slowest Starbucks staff I have come across! and I had to repeat my order 4 times, when I did I made sure I said LATTE at the end each time and each time I got an eye roll and a "ok what kind of drink is it" ummm lets see double tall vanilla LATTE oh I know a milkshake?
Hotel rooms are nice and big! Claim. Jumper restaurant located downstairs has delicious burgers, the pool is beautiful with a slide going through an aquarium. Would definitely stay there again :) . . The only down side is that we stayed in Rush Tower and since we arrived on a weekday and at night, the Rush Tower Front Desk was closed. We had to check in at the main front desk. Other than that, we were satisfied with the service :)
I've stayed at The Nug about 7 or 8 times since 2006; my most recent stay was over the Halloween weekend this year.  My stays have usually been for a group event that we have once a year there.. . ***  THE ROOMS  ***. . There are three room towers:  The Carson, The Better Tower, and The Rush.  . . Carson rooms are OK, with somewhat dated furnishings and somewhat beat-up hallways, but they recently got rid of the tube-TV's, at least.  They've always been clean and with hot water aplenty.  My last room had an under-the-window AC unit that was incredibly loud and rattly, and cycled on and off in 5 minute intervals.  If you don't pass out as well as I do in Vegas, it could be a problem.. . Another $20 or so a night gets you The Better Tower (I think it's called The Gold Tower?), which has rooms that are the same size as the Carson, just with newer furniture and plusher duvets.  Not that you'd ever want to snuggle up to a hotel comforter, but you get the point.. . Another $30 or so a night gets you the The Rush Tower.  These rooms are done up in 2009-chic dark woods and have a sofa lounger.  And I don't recall ever hearing the AC in them.  Rush Tower has its own entrance and check in desk too.. . *** THE CASINO ***. . Gone from OK to kinda sucky, and it's extra-smoky.  . Once upon a time they had single- and double-deck Blackjack without the 6-5 payout and all that other house-edge nonsense.  No more.  Even some of the 6-deck BJ's have restrictions attached.  Craps is like it is anywhere else, however. . Video poker has been dialed back from full 9/6 payouts to 8/5's or worse.. Occasional loud prostitute catcalls from little nuggets of the evening hanging out around the large central bar.. . *** RESTAURANTS AND WHATNOT ***. . The Grotto is pretty damn good.  Details to follow in a separate review.. The new Claim Jumper ("CJ's") is really good and 24 hrs.. Comped drinks aren't any more watery than the ones you buy, which are standard-strength.. The Gold Diggers nightclub isn't too clubby, doesn't appear to have a dress code, plays a mix of classic to current stuff, and provides a smashing view of Fremont Street.. There's a bar in the casino area that has fun classic rock and dance hit bands play.  Small dance floor is entertaining.. I'll cover the pool in another review.. . *** THE PEOPLE ***. Old and decrepit as all hell during the week.. Weekends are 50% oldies, 25% families, and 25% the rest of us.  It's Downtown, you get, for better or worse, anyone and everyone. I'll save my story of the guy with the Adolf Hitler tattoo for my pool review.
We are staying in the rush tower.  It is fantastic!  I haven't stayed downtown since I was a kid.  I usually stay at the Venetian.  We'll see how much I like the Casino but the room so far is absolutely fantastic.  It's like being in an Asian spa.  Decor is lovely, the sectional leather couch is great.  Anyway, a great value!!!!!   Stayed on 11/8/2014-11/11/2014.
best hotel in downtown fremont street.
This place does not look impressive from the outside, but give it a chance. It has a GREAT pool, which is a nice place to lounge and have a drink and a chat. I have been to their sushi restaurant and it was good. It was over a year ago, so I can't remember the details. There is also a candy shop with fun caramel apples that make good hostess gifts or souvenirs. I stayed in a room there a little over a year ago and it was a good value, but slightly shabby. Not bad, but not new.
The service here was seriously lacking. From the restaurant Grotto that refused to try to accommodate a party of 20 when they were slow but apparently "understaffed" to the bell hops at check out that took over  30 minutes to get our luggage after calling 3 times for the cart as well as waiting at valet for them to simply bring it out of storage. The place is lovely with much to offer but management has dropped the ball to have enough employees to provide the service to it's customers. The lack of effort to accommodate the guests was appalling.
We went to downtown Las Vegas to play a bit and walk around. We parked at the Golden Nugget. The sign for the charge for parking is hidden, purposefully, so you can't see it until you are leaving. The first three hours are free, if you know that you need to validate the parking at the cage. But of course, you would only know if you could see the sign. This is clearly done to deceive.. . The end result is that I won't be back to play at the Golden Nugget. If you need to deceive me out of $4, you are just shameful.
Well right now the review is not so good.  I have been coming here for 25 years and am very disappointed.  I booked a gold luxury room with VIP check in. Check in was fine except she checked me in under the wrong name. Stewart and not Swartz. I ran all over looking for the room. Gold Tower. Then they said Rush Tower then back to check in as I finally figured out I was checked in wrong.  That after providing a credit card and photo ID. Basically got a ops sorry from my second check in. Then they. Could not find our bags at the bell desk.  First they said they did not have a bell boy right now but we were first in line.  Well waited and waited and called again.   Sorry we don't have your claim check what do your bags look like.  So what was the first story we got then ?  They found the bags do we are all good now... Oops our room 1631 is right over Fremont Street and the Fremont Street Experience.  Guess we will not be sleeping much.  Sure hope things get better.
A very gracious lady Martha Sanchez called my wife tonight and apologized for the error. She offered to buy us breakfast in the morning and wanted to make sure we were happy. We appreciate her attention to this matter and felt she did give us excellent customer service. We have stayed her numerous times and will come back.
Terrible service. Took me like an hour to check in. They only have one person doing the registrations.  They also sell water for 4$....
Alerted them of a Facebook post where their employee was threatening to assassinate the president. Their response was to block me from their page. Now, because they employ trigger happy employees, I will no longer stay here. Besides, your entire hotel sucks anyway.
The hotel it self and the rooms are really nice. Very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The restaurants that we tried inside the hotel were both really good too. However, the cigarette smoke was almost unbearable. I was stuck in our room the majority of the time. I could not breathe, my eyes watered and we both reaked of cigarette smoke when we got back to the room. Honestly, it's kind of too bad because the hotel room was really nice. I guess im lucky because I was in it alot! Just be aware if you stay here. If you have allergies or are sensitive to cigarette smoke, don't stay here!
They fraudulently charged a "destination fee" of $23 on my credit card. They asked for the card for a security deposit, never mentioned these charges. I paid for my reservation through Orbitz.. . They get one star, because any business that commits fraud does not deserve to be patronized. I had stayed with them three times previously, but no more.
Stayed here last year for my birthday, made a reservation again for this year. Was thirty minutes late and they sold my room? Completely ruined my plans and night almost. Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Working in sales and customer service, I would have never told a customer their is nothing you can do... Will not be returning. Especially planning to spend $300 plus on a suite for one night in run down Fremont.
We were there for Thanksgiving weekend. We booked through last minute through Expedia. Just grateful to get a room I was surprised when we checked in that we were assigned a suite in the Rush Tower at no extra charge. The four stars are for the room which was beautiful. The bathroom was huge with a walk in closet. The minus one star is for the very loud air conditioner, so loud you couldn't hear the TV. The other negative was the parking. On Friday night we arrived at the valet at 9:00 pm and told there were no openings and to go to the other valet. That valet also had no openings and were directed to the parking garage where there was a long line of cars all seeking an open parking space that didn't exist. After spending 30 minutes in the lot we were directed to the Plaza lot and told we would be reimbursed the $5.00 fee. After hearing our plight the nice attendant at the Plaza didn't charge us the fee. After spending another 30 min in this lot with no luck I finally found a group leaving and slowly followed them to their car. When I checked out the next morning the desk clerk asked if I needed help with my luggage. I told her sure if she had someone available to trek to the back of the building then across the street and through a construction zone to get to my car. She declined.
