Wonderful experience here! Accidently entered on the Palazzo side of the property and instead of having to walk through the congested casino we were upgraded to that side. The rooms are all large with a sunken living area and light blocking drapery. We had 3 tvs (1 in the bathroom, which was also gorgeous with a hug tub, separated glass shower and the toilet in a room all to itself. There is also a vanity area with am exquisite bench) and plenty of comfort in the king size bed. I got this vacation at a steal and will definitely consider coming again (I don't gamble but had never been to Vegas so now it's off my bucket list)
I have to start this off with saying that even though I'm going to list a few complaints, I cannot give this hotel anything less than five stars. We only stayed here one night, but it was the best night we had in Vegas, hands down. I got a deal on the room so I'm not used to a hotel of this calibur.. . THE GOOD:. - Luxurious looking rooms.. - King sized bed was beyond comfortable.. - Completely sound proof.. - The curtains and blinds were controlled by remote. (I'm easily amused, sorry).. - Separate bath tub and shower. . - Security preventing random people having access to the hotel floors.. - Countless food/shopping choices on-site.. - Room service was wickedly fast/precise.. - Customer service at the front desk was unbelievably friendly/helpful. They allowed us to check in early free of charge.. - Held our luggage for free after check-out so we could ride the gondolas and walk around a bit before our next check-in.. . THE BAD:. - They didn't tell us WiFi was included in the resort fee, so that was lost potential. . - NO complimentary beverages. Not even water. (But the selection of in-room paid drinks was amazing - also the tap water was drinkable).. - Housekeeping woke us up at 8 am and 11 am even though we had late check out at 2 pm. That was honestly the worst thing, and it wasn't truly a big deal.. . I would stay here again in a heartbeat!. It may be overlyexpensive, but it was totally worth it.
So without a doubt, the Venetian is a gorgeous, luxury hotel.  And if you plan to spend most of your time in a romantic getaway nestled in a romantic room, this may be the place.  Us?  It's Vegas baby!  Time to get out there and have some fun! . . My boyfriend had a conference over in the Palazzo and had a discounted rate here so we decided to try it out.  The Venetian has been one of my favorite places to wander around in with it's gorgeous looks and great places to grab a bite or two of food.  I'm not a fan of the hotel however.   This place is well named as Venice is a complex maze of hard to navigate streets and canals as well.  I never knew quite where I was in the hotel and it took a good ten minutes just to walk from our room to the casino floor.   Since their rooms are in towers, you have to take an elevator up to the hotel lobby, walk down a long hallway, take another elevator up to your floor and then walk down another couple hallways to your room.  Simple in theory, but every time I came up I saw people having to stop for directions....just to get to their room!   At least there is gorgeous decor to accompany you on your aimless lost wanderings around the halls of the Venetian. Gas lamps, gilded accessories, comfy chairs to rest your weary legs in.... . Our room was very nice however, with a comfy bed, suite layout with separate seating area and a shower AND large tub.  Our view was of a parking lot and a parking garage, but had some mountains in the background that were nice if you blocked out the lower view.  All in all it was a lovely place, but next time I'll be staying somewhere I don't need a map and extra 15 minutes to navigate.
Stayed here for my girlfriends 21st and finally my 21st. Service and atmosphere is solid and absolute. I couldn't have gone anywhere else besides here. Next time we go back to vegas, we're most definitely staying here.
Loved it great experience exept for some big guy wearing a red ses shirt hit on my wife while we were walking by the covention center his name tag said john.. very upset but the venition itself was great
I've been to Vegas a bunch of times and staying at the Venetian was my favorite! We actually ended up in the Palazzo towers, and our suites were beautiful. They were large and spacious with a great bedroom area, and a sunken living room. The bathroom was amazing with a great jacuzzi tub and separate shower, and of course a TV (3 TV's total per suite!). I just love that the Venetian has so many great shops, restaurants, and of course that great Italian charm!
Not only was the room beautiful, the staff was great too. Ariella was very helpful during check in! She made sure we had everything we needed. She even offered us water and gave us a bottle of tooth paste since we forgot to bring one. . I will defiantly be staying here again thanks to her  great service!
So every Valentines day my bf and I would go to Las Vegas. I had called to book the room instead of booking online. I had explained to the lady on the phone that it was kind of an anniversary thing for us and she promised me the room would be exactly what I wanted. I hate when I pay for a "strip view" room and I only get a partial view or bottom floor room. When we arrived I couldn't believe the room we had! I have never been one of the double doors on the end and here I am standing in a suite on one of the higher floors with more than enough room for the 2 of us!!! The view was incredible! We could stand by the window and watch the Treasure Island show! I had never had turn down service before so it kind of scared me when the lady came in and did what she did. The staff was awesome and the location was wonderful. I was most impressed that when the fact that the lady who booked my room held up to the promise she made me. I will most defintely be staying here again :)
Very nice resort.  Staff was friendly and responsive.  We stayed in a King suite with a view of pool area looking west to mountains.  Room was fantastic - well appointed.  Among the few, would certainly recommend.  The Venetian and the Palazzo are connected via the Canal Shops.  Many quality restaurants and shops.
Best hotel on the strip, and I've stayed in just about every one. It's hard to stray from Venetian - really, youdon't need to leave the hotel... They have everything (high end dining and shopping, fun amenities, top notch night life including Tao beach club, extra friendly staff, and relaxation options). The location is fabulous too. . . There are other recent reviews stating that the rooms are outdated but I strongly disagree. Our room was huge, modern yet sophisticated, and so clean. The bathroom was my favorite, with double doors, a gorgeous makeup parlor, and separate tub for two.. . The one thing I can say was a tad annoying is that if you overlook the pool areas the music from the beach club is constant and loud, but a) this is vegas, why are you in your room? And b) the thick curtains drown most of it out.
The hotel is getting old. twice during my stay the keys would not work and it took them 30 minutes to get me a new key. The front desk clerk said I can get a room upgrade for a better view, which I took but I could not. Find the view... Stay at the Palazzo if you have to stay at this property..
Very smoky casino. Not sure why but much worse than any other hotel. Could smell smoke every time coming down from elevators and entering hotel from outside. . Rooms need severe updating. Can tell they haven't been updated since opening.
Oh, please come to our hotel, pay four times more than other places, and enjoy our construction noise, soft bed (this is a MINUS for us...we like something supportive), and down pillows that poke you in the face just as you're falling asleep. . . Thought it would be nice to finish our trip with a stay at the famous Venetian, but I'd say skip it. It's not worth the inflated price.
The most beautiful hotel on the strip. We got the king suite through Expedia which costs about 170 a night. The room was gorgeous with marble floors and two levels. The sunken level was a living room with an L shaped couch, desk, three chair dining table and tv. The upper level had a king size bed, double nightstands and tv. The bathroom had a double sink, separate makeup vanity and chair, tub, glass shower, and another tv. We had a slight view of the strip. We loved our room. The hotel is connected to the Palazzo and has 50+ restaurants, probably close to 100 high end shops, and 2 casinos. We arrived early to the hotel and were allowed to check in to our room at 10:00am. Great service and beautiful hotel.
I think its the 2nd or 3rd best hotel on the strip... I think that Ceasers is the best. It is very nice inside. service is great. But nothing over the top when I stayed. Thats why i gave them 4 stars.
I absolutely love the Venetian. The rooms are amazing, it's full of fun shops and activities and is gorgeous. Stayed here for the first time this past trip and have been spoiled for staying anywhere else. If you can afford a room here, I would definitely indulge. My only gripe is that front desk service was not so great; our room keys didn't work even after swapping them out, and needing security to get into the room each time is not fun. But considering the high quality of the Venetian, it wouldn't deter me from staying again.
Nice place to stay. Our room was huge! It's a nice looking place. They provided good service. The crowd in this hotel is a bit older though. My preference is Cosmo but this is definitely my #2 choice.
The Venetian is absolutely beautiful. The property is so huge you could get lost inside for days! The architectural and interior schemes of the casino-hotel are one-of-a-kind.. From high end restaurants (Mario Batali & Wolfgang Puck as such) to the food court, anyone on a budget can eat at the Venetian.. . I have stayed at the Luxury Suites here, and it's one of the nicest rooms on the strip. How nice is the bathroom inside the luxury suite? As my good friend's girlfriend quoted, " Phil, oh my gosh I could live inside this bathroom".. . Only gripe I have with this establishment is I am down like $2500 at the blackjack tables. Come on Sheldon Adelson, let me win sometimes!
I've stayed at many hotels on the strip, but this experience of staying at the Venetian far exceeds that of all my other vegasexperiences. . . The room is HUGE, beautiful, comfortable and luxurious. . As a girl all I need is a huge space, nice view and CLEAN bathroom. . Let's talk about the bathroom: 1 shower 1 bath, a separate room for the toilet, 2 different sinks, huge bathroom, lots of mirrors, white tiles, AND best part yet: a separate makeup station, with a chair and magnified mirror  . . Lovely stay . We also got in-suite dining part of the deal. Felt like a queen to be honest. Lol
