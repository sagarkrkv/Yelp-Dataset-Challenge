Food is good but not out of this world. The cook could learn to be more kind to the customers.
With tons of modern casinos and hotels on the strip, there's really no reason to venture to palace station. But within this outdated casino is a wonderfully delightful seafood "bar", conveniently called oyster bar.. . I was told about this quaint little location by my best friend before my recent trip vegas and was even warned about the long lines and waiting time. But I will say this get there as early as possible because the waiting time can be ridiculous. Here's an example, I went on a Monday night at 1AM in the morning and wasn't seated till 2:45AM. Yes for a Monday night that's insane but so worth the wait. The yelp reviews alone gives you a taste of what to expect.. . So when my wife and I finally got seated we shared a dozen oysters. They shucked the oysters in front of our eyes and I must say they were fresh and delicious. With just the right amount of horse radish, and hot sauce made it a perfect appetizers. We then order what's clearly the most popular dish, the pan roast. It's a combination of seafood and what appears to be a very tomato bisque type soup, with a definite taste of Parmesan cheese. It's served with a scoop of rice. The presentation reminded me of gumbo. The process alone to make this tasty dish is worth watching. The chef entertains you while cooking multiple dishes in what seems to be a roasting/ stemming pot. . . With seating for about 10-12 people there will always be a wait but the staff are pleasant and entertaining. They make you feel at home but definitely don't take shortcuts with their food. Since it's off the strip it's a place you will have to make a detour too but I'm telling g you it's worth it. Despite being in a smoky and outdated hotel, the oyster bar is clearly the shinning jewel of this location. I guarantee I will always make a personal stop there everytime I'm in Vegas.
Ok...so the food was decent, although the oysters were watered down a bit but none the less huge! The way this place is set up it's literally a bar in a casino with about 15 chairs available. You literally have to wait in a line and wait until someone is done eating in order for you to sit and order. We waited for close to 2 hours. It was not worth it!!! The service was mediocre. What truly ruins this place is the set up and the ridiculous wait time.
This place is so good and like everyone says it is worth the wait.. . It is only bar top seating with 18 seats i think. So the wait can be anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours. . . I usually always get the combo pan roast. Its like a bisque with seafood and spicy.Comes with rice so that helps with the spice. I have once tried the bouillabaisse  and it was also tasty the broth was lighter compared to the pan roast. I have also had the clam chowder which is also good. We always get a dozen of their oyster, I mean what can you say about oyster other than delicious.
My friend jt told me about this place.  Ive been coming to LV since 1978 and my first time here.  WOW I got the combo pan roast.  Fantastic!  and i had no wait since i got there at about 8am on a Saturday, three seats taken.  Got in, pigged out and freakn loved it.  Great prices, spent 50 total.
Best gumbo I've ever had!! I tried oysters here for the first time; the texture wasn't for me but the rest of my group seemed to love it. The wait time can be a bit long due to the limited seating, but it's definitely worth the wait. :)
Everything they say is true. Amazing and worth the wait. We had the pan roast. Made the mistake of sharing it with my husband. We will be back ordering one each next time. The steamed muscles were fresh and tasty in a butter/wine/garlic broth. Thinking of driving out to Vegas from San Diego just for that.
Came here last night with my gf and let me tell you, the wait is excruciating. They need to expand a bit and have more tables because they tend to have a long wait time due to the fact of the seating, or maybe a limit at the table because they were people just chilling after they were done Eating taking selfies smh. Wait time was 2 1/2 hours!! . . . . We ordered the house gumbo cause we saw on yelp people suggested that and the pan roast combo. We also ordered a dozen of oysters. Oysters wasn't all that great it tasted gross. I've tasted better oysters at other places that are much more fresher and sweet tasting. The house gumbo came out good but I wouldn't go back and wait for that long just for that. Customer service was great I have no negative comment about our server. I'd give better ratings if there service was a lot faster by adding more chairs and tables.
Woohoo! As good as it gets !
We were there early for breakfast, made it just before the line started........wonderful food that was prepared expertly at the counter. Bouillabaisse and oysters for breakfast.......it was incredible. Not inexpensive but one of those meals worth the cost. Even my Hungarian heritage bland food wife could not believe how great it was. She finished everything on the counter. Wonderful stuff. Viva Las Vegas!!!!!!!!!!
Hands down the BEST OYSTER BAR IN LAS VEGAS. If this place is the first oyster bar you try in Vegas I feel like other oyster bars were very disappointing.. That's how good this oyster bar is. Yeah, intense right?. . The only thing that is really unfortunate is the waiting.. But it makes you want it more! I definitely do not recommend going with a large group. I say four people the most. The wait is sooooo worth it at the end I can guarantee that.. . I crave their food every time I think about their delicious pan roast, oysters, and clam chowder. (Like I am right now) I've tried other things but those items that I just listed are my absolute favorite. With the pan roast I ask for the rice on the side. . . Customer service is good.
Wow, I now understand what the hype is about. We went at 9am and were seated right away. We had the combo pan roast which was absolutely amazing! It was so full of flavor with a nice balance of creamy and savory. The oysters were super fresh, shucked to order. The cioppino was not my fav, but the hubby enjoyed it. Pan roast and oysyers is a must! The best part though were the chefs/servers. They were hilarious and gave us a free gumbo taster.
Holloman is so amazing! Best chef ever, great spirit and even better food. . . Wait is super long but totally worth it.
Hands down the best seafood off the strip. The linguine with clam sauce is bangin!  Go there! Its fresh and atmosphere is fun coz everyone is enjoying the food. It's a bit of a wait on the weekends but not bad on weekdays. Go!
My body was defeated after waiting in line for three hours. Yes, three hour wait for this restaurant. Granted, it was the day after Thanksgiving. Thankfully, it was revived by amazing tastes of seafood medley presented by the Oyster Bar. . . We had half dozen oysters to start off our unforgettable experience. Oysters were big, nicely chilled, and fresh to the death. . . Gumbo and Alaskan New England style chowder was served next. You can ask spice on the side. I did that since spicy is not my thing. I'd say both dishes were definitely one of the best I've ever tasted. Portions are quite large, so can you take the amazingness home.. . Food was good. Service was two thumbs up. The only downside was the waiting time. Three hours is a long time.    However, it was definitely worth it.
The stars and amount of reviews say it all. Pan roast (level 5) and oysters rocked my thanksgiving night. Even though it was midnite, we still waited an hour. It was worth every minute of the wait. Do not come here starving because of the wait. Have a snack beforehand and you will be set for bliss when you get seated. Also if you come between 1am-9am, there's a sweet happy hour on oysters and drinks. . I think the chefs name is Holoman or soloman... Either way- he creates culinary delights!
waiting is 1-2 hours, but you know what, totally worth it! Love the combo pan roast the most, very flavorful, lots of seafood, and the rice to mix with it was properly cooked. Linguine with clam was good but not outstanding. will go back to again for the pan roast even have to stand in line for another 1 hour or longer
Alaskan clam chowder spicy level 5. Combo panroast spicy level 5 . . Clam chowder was really good and it comes with a lot alot alot a lot of seafoods. The portion was really big too. My girlfriend and I could not finish both dishes. We barely had panroast which was little salty. I personally do not think their foods were worth the wait. Air in casino was shitty.
