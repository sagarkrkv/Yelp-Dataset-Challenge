I read about all the shows available in Vegas before deciding on this one, because it's description was so interesting. It said "alternate lifestyle" which piqued my interest. But the show was bit of a let down itself.. First, even though we bought the most expensive tickets in the house, our seats were trashy. We were seated on a side row, and all actors faced towards the front area 80% of the time. . Second, there was no story to the play. It was just another regular cirque du soleil, that you can see anywhere, with partial nudity added to it. There was no "lifestyle" whatsoever. Without a story, it was hard to stay engaged. . Third, there were a lot of actors on stage at various times with one main actor doing the stint. It was hard to focus on the main actor while those in background kept doing their tidbits.. . In my opinion, this show is a one-time watch, but not definitely a must-watch as people say. You are not missing out on anything by missing this one.
Loved this show! Worth every penny! I didn't have high expectations because I feel asleep durning O but hands down this show is a must see if you are comfortable with sex. You can get cheap tickets on the strip at half price tickets! Stop thinking about seeing it and go do it!!!!
Great show!  Funny, risque, awesome performances.  Husband and I saw it during our 20-year anniversary trip to Vegas.  We wanted to see a show that took advantage of our kid-free weekend.  We had great seats in the second row so were incorporated a bit into the pre-show antics.  Super fun evening all in all.  If anything I could have done with more cirque (amazing athleticism!!) and a little less of the risque asides (funny but not as impressive) but would recommend this show.
This show is not for the prudish but if you're curious, I say go for it but be very warned lol. Before the show started, half naked men and women came out feeding some of the audience strawberries. Some were even flirting with the couples. This show is an extremely sex driven, lustful, artsy type of show. Definitely take your significant other and have a good time.  You will see a little bit of everything, have a drink, let your hair down and enjoy.
This show was awful.  I've been to many Cirque shows and I have no idea how they allow this show to exist.  There were minimal acrobatics, just a lot of toplessness and bad jokes.  That's $88 and 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.
I've been to many Cirque shows and loved every one of them. I typically like the music, show value for the entertainment it provides, choreography, makeup, costume and so on. . . This show starts with the comedic actors drawing in the crowd and it drew me in as well. Once the show started, it quickly turned into a cabaret show. There was little acrobatic display, no flying of performers, and the whole show had sex as the underlying tone. I found the skit with the two guys dancing, kissing too much and from there on I thought...when will this be over?. . I won't return, I can't recommend it to a typical cirque enthusiast, unless you're aware it's a cabaret show.
Sexy Cirque show. Check out peep holes in the hallway. We had champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.
I loved this show it's very sexual but hey it's vegas!!! I recommend this show to any couple!! The theater is not too big so anywhere you sit is great.
This show is ok, worth seeing at a discount.  I actually thought it would have some drop dead beautiful men, woman and other.  They were some nice looking folks but no show stopping numbers.  The girls in the glass, were very good.  One of the more voluptuous dancers, long beautiful hair and big boobs was actually mesmerizing.  I wish i knew her name so I could give her credit.  . Was expecting more beauty than I got.  The acts were very good, but nothing amazing.
I went with extremely high expectations. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met. I didn't feel the passion/connection among the actors. Sure they get naked, have some fun, and are naughty. I thought there would be more of a connection where you could feel the love and passion between the people on stage. I think this could be done with appropriate music and eye contact and caressing.
We arrived in Vegas and decided to get in relaxed state of mind pronto by attending Zumanity. It was pure joy and super fun. The theater is lovely, set is beautiful and music haunting or jovial as needed. All very well done. But what makes this show is a fun loving and very talented cast. No matter their roles, all the performers are exceptional. This is Burlesque at it finest with talented singers, dance, acrobatics and fun campy skits. We sat in the sofa seats and enjoyed the proximity to the stage, you may well be party to some of the skits in the show but it is all in good fun. Let your hair down and enjoy this romp!
It's arousing!  But I should note I am easily aroused.. . The male performers are like Chippendale buff but the acts all seem to show they would be very interesting in bed and not just a pretty bod.  The kinky outfits are cool too.  Again, I'm should note I am into kinky outfits.  The outfits reveal chests and butt - super tone, young, and smooth.  Not that I'm only into those traits.  I wouldn't want any cute average guys, yummy bears and otters, or sexy daddies in the Yelp universe to think I wouldn't be into them, because I would be.. . I sat in the nosebleed balcony seats a little to the left and thought it was great.  The prime seats could get you called on stage and I am not into that.  But it made for some fun audience interactions.. . My ticket was comped but I heard they were about $30 the day I picked them up at the box office (located next to the Zumanity theatre and food court) but listed in the $70s range.  Definitely don't pay listed price for these seats.. . I didn't realize it could go that cheap but I don't know if it's normal or not to be that low.. . Ohh yeah, there were lots of boobs.  Not my area though to go into details.. . However, the guys seemed really well manscaped.. . Not the most acrobatic but an interesting show.
Save your money and see another show. Very disappointing and very "uncomfortable" show to watch.
My bf and I went to see this 11/17/14. It was sexy and fun! Lots of boobies and super talented people! The hosts were really funny, but I would of preferred less of them in between acts. It's like you watch this sensuous act and get all caught up in it and then BAM you're confronted with silliness! I'd rather stay in that sexy moment for a bit :) The theater is really cool and it looks like all the seats would be great!
Unfortunately I cannot give Zumanity more than 3 stars. Acrobats and costumes and music were great, but the jokes were just not appropriate and unnecessary. It spoilt the whole experience. I was expecting more from this show. And I thought it was a way overpriced.
