This is not a luxury hotel but a timeshare/condo hotel.  I had to be moved three times and still jot great. Furniture watermarked, scratched and dirty. Kitchen cabinets are chipped and worn.  The hotel is not that old and obviously its customers do not take care of it.  If you stay in the animal tower, you will hear dogs barking.  While staff friendly the rooms are overpriced for how they are maintained. But if you are in the mentality that you rented a timeshare or a condo then you will be pleased.  Nice to have a full kitchen but you have to call three times to get cups, teakettle, silverware etc.  Just know going in and you may be happy
We stayed lots of Hotels in Vegas.This was the first time stayed at Vdara couple days ago.This was the great experience.Great service.Great personel.Most important you don't need to find parking space by yourself.Valet taking care of parking no extra charge.Very helpful.If you stay other Hotels sometimes trying to find parking it takes forever.When I go to Vegas never stay other hotels.Vdara my favorite.Thanks Vdara giving us great experience for our vacation.See you guys as soon as possible.Thank you.
This hotel was a very disappointing experience. I like to travel with my dogs and Vdara advertises being dog friendly. I called them before I made any reservation to get detailed information on their pet policy. . . They told me that they provide dishes and crates for the dogs so I wouldn't have to bring my own. . . I drove there so I could have easily brought my puppy's cage and dishes for my dogs. However, since I was told I wouldn't need either I didn't bring any of them with me. . . After I checked in, exhausted from my long drive 2 tiny crates arrived at my room. The hotel says up to 2 dogs combined weight per room 70lbs. The crates they brought were too tiny for my 43lb Springer and my 30lb puppy could be crammed in but couldn't lay down or sit comfortably. . . They delivered blankets, a bisquit and a room service menu but no baggies as promised and no bowls. So I called downstairs 4 times to get no answer and went down to speak to them finally. I was told they only had paper dishes and no larger crates. . . Obviously the paper dishes are not so reuse able with water and difficult to clean from food too so I had to ask for a new set the following day and didn't even get real dog dishes, no attempt was even made to give a a real bowl from room service. . . Then my second night the puppy got stuck in the tiny crate and suddenly 2 different size larger crates appeared at my door after being toldmany times that they had nothing larger. . . My dogs were dying of thirst the entire stay and everytime I needed to feed them was a project. This was not relaxing!  It was frustrating and some of the hotel staff were apologetic but most couldn't be bothered helping me with the dogs needs. . . If you can't make proper accommodations you should not call yourself pet friendly!  I was charged a fee for having the pets but not given the necessary accommodations for them as promised. . . Very frustrating. . . I also got no bell service at check out and the valets were not helpful with my bags loading up my car when I had 2 dogs in my hand too. . . The beds were not comfy either and all around Vdara was a HUGE disappointment.
Hotel  is convenient, but really not worth staying off the strip.  I most likely will not stay here agin but would recommend this for someone staying for a conference, with kids or for someone who does not like a casino.  I knew there was no casino ahead of time.. . . The spa is amazing and our massages were fabulous!  Joan and John were great!  Fitness and Swedish massages were lovely.. . The hotel was clean.  Check in Staff was quick and valet was also very quick!  . . Overall decent place to stay.
The following is the email I sent right on 8/22/14 (Fri) after the pool service at the Bar Vdara on the 1/F of the hotel. They just sent us back an email that they received it with no follow up at all. Since I am checking others on yelp. I am going to post the email here.. . Dear management, . . I am your guest at room 270XX with my husband staying sincethis Tue and will be leaving today. Yesterday after we came back for dinner at Adir and went to Bar Vdara for a drink. We were standing at the entrance and waiting to be seat.  No waitress came over to us even it was not many guest at the bar. There was a bartender pointed us the way and told us to seat ourselves while I could see there were several waitresses standing behind him doing nothing.  After we sat down for a while, no one came over to us to say anything. My husband saw a waitress brought a drink to the table behind me and she even looked at him but still didn't come over or say anything to us. We stayed another two minutes and waiting to order some drinks. After several minutes, still no one came over. My husband said this was ridicious and we left. Then we got some drink and cake at the market located across the bar. We had a very bad experience at your bar and would like to report to the management since I believe the management should know about their poor service to their guest and someone need to deal with it. We never has such pool service in a hotel restaurant before and it is not acceptable.
V for Vdara.. . On the last leg of my recent Vegas trip, I spent three nights at Vdara, one of the many properties in the City Center Complex.  Though this hotel does not have its own casino, its sister property Aria, with its casino and many bars and restaurants, is only a short walk away.  . . We had a corner suite with a spectacular view of Aria and surrounding areas.  Amenities of our suite included:. . *A kitchen area complete with refrigerator and small dining area/table.. . *Small living room space with a sofa, flat screen television, and coffee table.. . *Spacious bathroom with dual vanities, soaking tub, make-up counter/area, generous closet space, and a roomy stand-up shower.. . *Push button controls for the blinds/shades for the entire room.  Very convenient and helpful.....there was just a wee bit of difficulty locating all the various controls.. . *Complimentary (and very comfortable) bath slippers.. . Overall, I liked our suite very much.  The kitchen and living room areas were a very decent size, while the bathroom was much larger than I expected.  There was also a placard in the kitchen area stating that kitchen utensils and accessories (pots, pans, etc), were available on request.  As far as the bed is concerned, it was soft and extremely comfortable.  . . I feel my only gripe about the room is that we had some difficulty, initially, locating all the controls for the blinds.  Also, I did wonder why two doors were given access to the bathroom (one from the bedroom and the other via the kitchen).  I thought that was a bit odd, though the door access from the kitchen could be locked from inside the bathroom.  Lastly, there was a slightly vinegar odor in the room when we arrived, and so maintenance was sent up to the room with an air purifier type device.  Thankfully, the smell disappeared later that night.. . Lastly, some hotel amenities I took advantage of were the Starbucks and convenience store/coffee shop in the lobby.  I commend the baristas at the Starbucks, as they exhibited much teamwork the morning I visited.  Adversely, the store is part coffee shop and part convenience store.  You're able to order pastries and coffee, while there is a self service section for water, juices, sodas, snacks, etc.  Items are a bit pricey, but hey, you're paying for the convenience after all.. . BOTTOM LINE:  A pleasant 3-night stay at the Vdara Hotel.  I wouldn't mind returning to stay on a future trip.
I always stay at the Vdara when I'm in Vegas since my familyhas a room here. I love how the lobby always smells so good and how friendly the valet and front desk workers are. The studio I'm always at is always clean and housekeeping is great whenever I need extra items, even cookware! . . I guess the only problem I encountered was that housekeeping once complained about how much towels we asked for. My son loves bubble-baths and he made a huge mess one time so we had to use all the towels to clean up the mess he made. I guess they didn't really think about the fact that I was just trying to help.
This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in.  The rooms and bathrooms are huge and they have a little eat in kitchen area (which I was told is because they were originally meant to be condos, but they couldn't sell them)
Las Vegas probably needed a hotel (or condo/hotel) like this, as it's for a very different clientele.  . . The hotel tries the wellness angle, where it's non-smoking, doesn't have a casino, and even allows dogs in some rooms/floors.  It's next to Aria, which is set back off The Strip more than you'd think from a map or pictures.  Like Aria, Vdara too pipes in a smell throughout, but it's more floral than Aria's vanilla.  . . The pool is (or was, as they've since added more umbrellas for coverage) infamous for their "death ray", which has been known to literally melt plastic with its intensity.  . . Officially, there are dining places in the Vdara, but they're more in the "grab a snack" category than the restaurant category.  Vdara's website refers you to Aria for actual meals.  . . For the wellness minded person who isn't in Las Vegas to gamble and was sort of dragged along by his/her friends - or for those who can't travel without their dog -  Vdara is your place.  . . If you're like me though, and you were just trying Vdara to try it or because you found a good rate, not having any sort of casino is too much of a deal breaker.  I thought Aria being next door would be fine, but it'll still take you a 10 minute walk to get to a machine or table because they're deceptively farther away than you might think.  If you just want to gamble for a few minutes as you're killing time, it's not really that close.
My go-to hotel when traveling to Las Vegas for business. The staff are extremely competent and professional. I appreciate the security at the elevator banks ~ nobody gets by without a keycard. . . Rooms are beautiful (I have a sweet view of Lake Bellagio's night light show, the new Ferris wheel and the City's neon lights).. . I was able to pre-purchase my room at a great rate which included a $50 food credit to be used at their market, Starbucks, restaurant/bar, or room service. It was quite handy for snacks and waters during my stay. . . Whenever next in Las Vegas, I'll be back.
This place is gorgeous!  I went to Vegas for business and got an amazing suite with a small kitchen, beautiful bathroom with a large garden tub, a shower, a living room area and a king size bed.  Everything was clean and the room service while you are there are very thorough.  The room service is fast and delicious - expensive but what do you expect for room service in Vegas.  The staff are all very accommodating and they offer the ability to check out on your cell phone - you don't even have to go to the desk.  Would love to stay here again.
Arrived at desk at 1:25 to check in. Was told "TSA" (cleaning staff)/are in the room, will not be too long of a wait. Now I've been waiting one hour in the lobby, told by front desk they're still in the room but no ETA and no further information available. Bad first impression to say the least. What I was initially told no longer seems truthful. If its going to be a long (over 30 minutes wait) please just be honest and tell me when I am trying to check in. I understand if your staff is very busy but just be forthcoming about that this is so frustrating.. UPDATE: They upgraded me (complimentary) to one higher type of suite. Front desk agent was very understanding and acted with great calm and poise on my final visit to the front desk (I was not in a pleasant mood). Changing this to four stars as they made up for the initial mishap without any friction. Thank you.
What an amazing hotel! The rooms are gorgeous and spacious, very well decorated with a "spa-like" feel. I had a mini suite with a powder room at the front, a living room with a couch and desk (TV TOO), a kitchen with a full fridge, stove and microwave,  and a beautiful corner view (lots of windows). The blinds are push button and the bathrooms are huge (large stand alone tub). The hotel does NOT have a casino which was no big deal since there are so many within walking distance (Aria is right next door). The place does not smell like smoke at all.  There is a bar in the main lobby with all kinds of different libations (expensive!) and a "market" as well as couple different restaurants (pizza, mexican food etc) and a Starbucks (always crowded). I love this hotel and will stay often. Also the security team stands near the elevators and asks to see your key (very safe!).
On my last trip to Las Vegas I stayed at Vdara Hotel & Spa.  I loved that it was smoke free and did not have a casino.  The front desk staff were very accommodating and professional (quick service).  The room was fantastic, spacious and very much like an upscale apartment based on design.  The pool was lovely... . . One criticism, if you like fine dining their restaurant dining choices are limited. Looking for fine dining I recommend you walk over to Aria Hotel, plenty of great choices... . . All in all a great property for business or pleasure. I will go back.
Long walk from the strip to hotel. Best part of the whole week was when I got my "RESORT FEE" 4 days $84.00.. $84.00 for what. November? winter? I guess walking by the pool is worth $84.00. Don't get me wrong it is nice the room was great but thats all.
My fiance (now husband) stayed here when we came to Las Vegas to get married and honeymoon.. . We had a wonderful experience and I would definitely stay at Vdara (or any MGM property) again.. . Every single staff member was helpful, especially that first day when we were getting use to the lay of the hotel.. . Unlike some reviewers *ah hem* I always make sure to read my paperwork before signing up for anything.  Read up on all the amenities, resort fees and taxes and included this in my planning. Just makes sense.. . The room was spotless, and was cleaned daily and checked at least 2x a day.  There was an optional turn down service, but we turned it down.  The waters left in the room by staff we highly appreciated! We left a tip for the staff every single day.. . The windows were huge and really let you take in the mountains in the background, and the city at night. You could not beat the view from our room. 38 floors up we could see the Eiffel tower, Bellagio fountains and the High Roller (new 550ft observation wheel, tallest in the world atm). . Since we were there a week but only brought carry-on luggage, we also made use of the washer/dryer.  It is just a small stacked set made to handle shirts and pants, not larger items, which was fine.  The Vdara provided complementary detergent and dryer sheets on request.. . There was an in-suite kitchen, and being able to save leftovers and heat them up properly to eat tomorrow was a blessing. . . The Market Cafe in the lobby was nice because of convenience (but you will pay for it of course). . It was very nice to 'get away' from the city when you were ready to sleep.  No casino, no smoking, quite and peaceful.  And if you are a night owl is is a short walk away are Bellagio and Aria, both are excellent properties to visit. Bellagio has the gardens and fountains, both have casinos. Also there is a free tram to Monte Carlo and Crystal Shops. . . To those complaining about walking, why on earth would you choose a Las Vegas Vacation? And why on earth would you stay here if you wanted to be on the strip?  Do you not know how to read a map scale?
Incredible experience. Non smoking, clean, beautiful, connected to Bellagio and steps away from Aria.  My dogs loves the dog park and everyone was so pleasant.  I will never staycation anywhere else.
First time here and we will be back. From the initial greeting of the front desk staff, to the bellman that assisted us with our bags, the hospitality staff and all of the employees in the hotel, we could not have been treated more like royalty.. . Our room was a corner suite which included a guest half bath, full separate kitchen, stackable washer and dryer, work area desk, pull out couch and a master suite with the most luxurious bathroom separate tub and shower dual vanities and a wraparound interview that was breathtaking. . . If you have not stayed here before I highly recommend this property which is located in the center of all the action just one block off the strip.. . We have found our second home away from home and will be back soon. Thank you Vdara!!
Their hotel is nice, but their shaving kit is a joke. Had to go out of my way and walk to Walgreen's to get something that even worked. My facial hair isn't even that coarse, but it took going over the same spot 10 times hoping the razor would eventually rip the hair out of your face, since the blades were too dull to cut anything. I gave up, and walked to Walgreen's with a patchy face. The cheapest two-blade plastic razor there was able to finish the job going over my face once.
Great location, incredible rooms, and tremendous value booked via: hotels.com.  Boutique, so no casino and no smoking = outstanding, fits what we need in business travel to the dreadful business convention venue that is LV.  Only suggestion would be to open lobby Convenience store and Starbucks earlier.  For those of us that business travel, 6am is LATE...will stay again when in LV.
Money well spent.Room was awesome & the view was breathtaking! Definitely coming back.
My gal pal and I decided to stay at Vdara for our first visit to Vegas in late July. We got a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful corner suite on the 50th floor - clean, spacious, two bathrooms, washer/dryer, and a kitchenette (full fridge/freezer, dishwasher, stovetop - you just need to ask them to send up pots/pans/cutlery) which was great for keeping food costs down!. . It is on the other side of the Bellagio (further away from the strip, about a 10 minute walk - blocks in Vegas are huge!) and it was really nice to not have to walk through a smoky casino every time we left our hotel. There is a Walgreens kitty corner from Bellagio that had a good assortment of fresh and frozen food, and alcohol. The concierges were great - they helped us book discounted Cirque du Soleil tickets, make restaurant reservations, and had lots of advice for restaurants and bars (including guest list and passes for day pool parties). . . I liked the pool area, lots of umbrellas for shade, but also the ability to close them if you wanted to tan. There were a lot of children there though so I imagine that was a function of Vdara being a casino-less hotel. . . Vdara doesn't have a complimentary airport shuttle service, but they can arrange for a shuttle, and other airport shuttles do stop there. They do have complimentary luggage storage though. Regarding the resort fee - our travel agent had advised us of this ahead of time, and that this was common practice at the bigger hotels, so we weren't surprised. . . Overall I enjoyed my stay at Vdara and would definitely consider staying here again.
My husband and I recently stayed here for the first time. There's not a bad thing I can say about this hotel. We had the most basic room, which still had a dining room for two and a couch! Plenty of room for both of us. Easy access to Bellagio through a outdoor hallway and also the strip via a 5 minute walk inside the Bellagio. Although it does not have a restaurant, the Market Cafe has plenty of premade sandwiches and salads too choose from and a menu you can also order from. Only downside is that the Cafe does close at midnight for people who stay out late, but it didn't hurt our experience of the hotel. Other than that, this hotel has all you can ask for. Beautiful room, great views and love that it is all smoke free.
I seriously don't even know where to begin with how impressed I am time and time again with the level of service that Vdara provides each and every time I visit! Vegas has a hotel for everybody and after staying at almost all the MGM owned properties I think it's safe to say that Vdara is my favorite one and I'll explain briefly why! The fact that this is a non-gaming property puts its above the others and the fact that you don't smell that horrible stench of cigarette/cigar smoke when you get back to your room is even better! Don't get me wrong I love a little gambling here and there but it's a hop skip and a jump to get over to the tables if desired when staying at Vdara! The valet employees are all very fast and efficient! The front desk employees are all professional and pleasant to deal with when checking in/out! The rooms are AMAZING! Booking even the deluxe suite will do you right! Oh and if you are like me and bring your dog everywhere Vdara caters to us animal lovers! Very pet friendly :-) Will always be my first choice in hotel stays!
My friend and I stayed at the Vdara this past weekend for a Vegas weekend and it was a great experience. Vdara is one of a few newly constructed developments on the strip. I did not realize the Vdara was just a hotel. The best part of this property is that it is not like your other hotel/casinos where smoke is everywhere. This property is modern, clean, and convenient to the strip.  If you are not a gambler and want a property that is relaxing and modern, this is the place to stay. I really do not have any negative things to say about this hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean and the bathrooms were very clean and modern (includes a shower with glass doors and an actual bathtub). It even has a kitchen inside the room which was convenient! Overall, our experience was amazing and the hotel staff were great. One night we had ordered room service at 4am and the food and service was top notch. This is a place where I would come back again.
This is a really nice hotel...you won't have to figure out if it has that personality that will fit yours like many in Vegas...nice and very reasonable if you can hook up with one of their internet specials...great for romantic adults and great for families as well....a can't miss...
Love this hotel, no casino and it is smoke-free!  Suite was spacious and very nice.  I love the interior - the decors and layout of room.  Very comfortable, beautiful view.  The only thing i didn't like were the white towels.  They didn't look so white and had stains on them (even the new ones I requested). Kitchen doesn't come with pots, pans, utensils but you can request for them (no charge but I did tip them couple times, just because I requested so many things). I was on the 52nd floor, room 52003.....city view. Try requesting a room with an even #, i think those rooms have way better view (with fountain).  I asked to see if they had any complimentary upgrade but they were booked for the weekend, so no luck there! Overall, great experience!
Enjoyed our stay in Vdara for the most part. . . Pros:. - Great value for your $.. - Non-smoking, non-gambling. . - Included valet. Very friendly and will provide you directions to anywhere you're going.. - Modern. - Soaking Tub. - Huge windows with automated shades. - Great bed (feel so great in the morning!). - Starbucks on premises. - Cafe (although we never went there, too expensive and limited choices). - A short walk from Aria and Jean Philippe Patisserie (amazing crepes, don't miss out!). - Easy checkout. You can check out on your TV, just make sure the bill looks right. . . Cons:. - Was not as clean as we'd like. Hair in the bathroom, dirty windows, furniture smudges.. - No in-suite kitchenette. Wouldn't be a big deal if it didn't take over 40 minutes to get anything from housekeeping. . - We were charged $5 for a tiny bottle of water in the cooler. We thought this was complementary b/c the description of prices mentioned a specific water brand and that wasn't what we drank. Not a huge deal, but the fact that it was so difficult to distinguish what's charged and what isn't doesn't sit well with me. . - Walls not as thick as you'd like them to be. Woke up by the screaming sound of someone next door. Not sure if all the rooms are like that, but our was. This is probably a one time thing but I'd like to mention it anyway. . . Overall this hotel has a lot going for it, away from the bright night light but close enough that you could walk there. . . Tips:. . Vdara is right across from Aria entrance (there are several). Once you go up the ramp and see Aria, just keep driving around until you see Vdara valet. . . An excellent crepe and other foods place called Jean Phillipe Patisserie is right inside Aria (just go left as you exit the lobby). . . There is a tram that will take you down the strip a ways (easiest access to the strip). The walkway to the tram is inside Vdara right next to the Starbucks. There's no easy way to get to the strip directly from hotel, I recommend taking the tram every time.
I really like the non-smoking and non gambling aspect of the hotel.  It is almost attached to the Belligo and Aria.. . We had a corner suite and it was an amazing view.  . . We did have some items missing from our hotel room, which I hope was an accident but seemed suspect.. . The room had a washer, dryer and dishwasher.  Weirdest part is they don't the dishwashing  tabs which made it pointless to have a dishwasher.  . . We will 100% return to this hotel.
What a gorgeous hotel!  Their rooms are pacious, clean, and modern.  We got a room with parital view of Bellagio fountain and amazing view.  The service staffs are polite and friendly.  Only valet parking, no self parking. There is a mandatory $28 resort charge (pool & gym). You won't smell like cigarettes on your clothes and hair because there is no casino inside this hotel.  No cigarette smokes to bother your eyes, nose, skin. I would definitely come back.
