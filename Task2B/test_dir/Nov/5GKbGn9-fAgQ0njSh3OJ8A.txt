Had the chicken and waffles and it could possibly be the worst thing ever. Being from the south and having had many chicken and waffle entrees; this was the worst. For a restaurant that is suppose to be so good they fail at this. On top of that is poor service. Slow. Ask for something an hour before you need it. Horrible experience.
I cannot understand how this place has so many 4+ star ratings. The environment is nice and it has a decent vibe but avoid the food. A better meal can be found at Fazolis. First off, they gave me a menu that was outdated. So my original selection was no longer offered. I settled on shrimp scampi which was essentially like eating tough rubber balls. The side dish of Alfredo was also horrendous. Finally, I thought I might be able to redeem dinner with a piece of cheesecake. Well not to disappoint I had a large completely taste free block of cheese with barely thawed berries. . . Oh and the fun didn't stop with dinner. This dinner continued to reward me well into the night with a severe bout of intestinal distress. AVOID THIS PLACE.
This review is for the LAVO party brunch over Halloween weekend.. . Let me just start by saying, this was the highlight of our Vegas trip.  I went with a group of about 50 or so friends and we all loved this place.. . About 10 of us girls and one of our guy friends were able to get in for free because we arrived about an hour early and had a fantastic promoter! . . We had a table around the bar area upstairs and they had goodies set up at the table for us, glow bracelets and necklaces, flower clips, mustaches, just fun little things that we thought were pretty funny to try on.  It was Day of the Dead theme so we all had flowers in our hair.  We received bottle service throughout brunch and were even served five amazing dishes including eggs benedict, my favorite, and belgian waffles amongst other delicious dishes.  Service was great, the staff was extremely helpful and courteous.  . . Once all of our friends began showing up, we were all pretty tipsy, having an amazing time, the DJ was killing it the whole day and none of us wanted to leave! I may or may not have spent $200 on Patron shots, but I'm just going to keep pretending that that did not happen.
I've been to LAVO nightclub like...3 years ago and my only memory of it then was how tiny and dark it was and having to weave in and out of the crowd.  I've never been back aside from now, but for their "Champagne Brunch" on Saturday.. . I'm still confused why it's called a Brunch at 2PM, but whatever,  Everyone got in free, including dudes, if you have a good promoter. Only the bottom room is open where they have all the tables set up.   It was open bar for the girls as well from 2-3PM and the bartenders were not stingy about that AT ALL.  There's an indoor dining area, the bar, and an outdoor patio area.  They play loud club music with the windows drawn, but there's no dance floor if that's what you're looking for.   Inside seating is reserved for table service.  Outside is first come first serve.  Nice place to chill and get your (Free) drank on.  . . Crowd was kind of bougie looking to be honest, but then again, it is Vegas.  It was a nice pit stop before hitting up a buffet.
Our friend heard about the giant kobe beef meatballs so I made an Open Table reservation within the hour and we walked over from our hotel!  The staff was very friendly and welcoming and we got a booth in the corner which was warm and inviting!  We decided to eat family style and get a taste of everything.  We were served complimentary garlic bread served with a tomato based sauce which was tasty.  We ordered a beet salad and the beets were good but the dressing was a bit on the sour side.  Then we had the Kobe meatball cut into four and it was humongous, tasty and filling!  Good thing we split it.  Next was the salmon oregano which was a hearty portion and very moist and delish.  The ending dish was the spinach and artichoke pizza which was hardy and had tasty mushrooms but nothing spectacular compared to the salmon.  All in all a tasty dining experience.
If you want a party during the day in the cold season, this is the place to be, especially for brunch on a Saturday.  When my friends and I came, the place was already packed.  We had to wait out front, but luckily it wasn't a long wait.  During the wait we just talked about how easy that one lady's job was just sitting on a high chair in a bikini looking pretty and we were wondering how much she got paid doing that lol. . There was guest list (brunch time 2-4pm) for ladies and gents, but only the ladies get complimentary champagne. We went through my promoter and it was suggested that we book a table; he was right.  Mainly for the ladies, it's $100 per girl.  You get food and drinks.  It was hard to walk around when my friends and I were there, so I would suggest booking a table if you're willing to throw down some money and have a good time.  My friends and I came kind of late, so next time we'll come earlier.
We went for dinner, and there was no nightclub.  We had a pleasant dinner with 6 friends.  Service was excellent, and I'm still dreaming about my salami and cheese platter.
While my most recent dining experience at Lavo was not as stunning as before, I and my party enjoyed an excellent meal.  As an opener, Baked Clams Oreganato yielded very garlicky clams but they were accompanied in their shells by a very tasty sauce.  And, the buttery Garlic Bread that came with the meal was so good that I sought and received another loaf--and, after its arrival, polished off most of it myself.  A Caesar Salad was an excellent Caesar, with unusual Pesto Croutons and requested anchovies.. . This time for my chosen entree I went more rustic, and, opting for some fine peasant cuisine, ordered Spaghetti with Kobe Meatballs, which featured large meaty balls, a superior thick tomato-based sauce, and fresh Ricotta and Parmigiano Cheese.  The dish was quite satisfying, as was a side of Roasted Rosemary Potatoes.  Diane also enjoyed her well-pounded Veal Parm.. . Service was excellent and attentive.  The only discordant note was really the too loud driving music played nonstop by the DJ.  It did not harmonize well with digesting food or trying to carry on a conversation with one's spouse and friends across a dining table.   . . Loss of a half-step, and so a half-star, this outing.  A 4-1/2-star experience overall!
