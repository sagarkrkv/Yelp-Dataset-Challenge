Really truly not my favorite. Check-in takes so long that you have to wait in roped off, winding snake line (like at Disney World) just to give your name and get to your room. After a long day of travel that is the last thing I wanted. The front desk staff were also unhelpful-- I had to ask where the gym and the pool were, no one offered that information and the gym is hidden inside the spa (way back), and the pool is randomly on the 6th floor so you'd never find it alone. The lobby has hideous lighting that is constantly changing and made me feel sick while I waited. The room was huge but the space was all wasted-- there was no refrigerator so we threw tons of leftover food away during our stay (not what you want in a city known for food), the television was positioned so that you couldn't watch it from the bed without straining, the decor was hideous and my back hurt every morning when I woke up from the terribly uncomfortable beds. My husband's company booked the room for us but I'd never stay here again even if it was paid for-- the tackiest hotel in the tackiest mall on the tackiest part of the Vegas strip, it just doesn't get any worse than that. The wifi was apparently free but also really really bad-- not fast enough to stream a movie or do work from the room. . . The only reason I thought of giving the place two stars instead of one is because Koi (restaurant on premises) was delicious-- but all of the other food was mediocre at best. The pool also wasn't scenic or particularly clean-looking but the staff was super nice and attentive out there and it was really big so there was plenty of room for guests to relax by the pool without being on top of one another, which was nice but it was just such an ugly pool space. The one staff member working at the gym was nice as well and they gave out free water bottles and apples. The view from the room wasn't so hot so I hope no one paid with that in mind. I'd go elsewhere.
PlanetHollywood is a great place to stay in Las Vegas.  The location is one of the best, it is pretty much in the middle of everything.  You have easy access to the entire strip.  The hotel has great options for food and since it connects to the mall shops you have everything you could ever need without even having to leave the hotel.  The casino area is small but still nice.  Check in and parking are easy and the service friendly.  The rooms were great and the beds comfortable.  I guess all the rooms have a movie memorabilia, ours had stuff from Natural Born Killers.  The room was very large and the bathroom one of the better ones I have had in Vegas.   They actually have good lighting and a huge bathtub.  I was happy with my stay and would stay here again.
The casino is nice the only problem is you have to go thru an army of very aggressive sales people to get in. . Not worth it. One of the worst spots on the strip. . I yelled at one of them to leave me alone and they surrounded me and my wife. . You have been warned
Good location, nice variety of food options. Pool sucks. Rooms are okay, lay out and furniture seemed a little odd to me, and only a small window to enjoy your view. We had the Air Bud room, did anyone even see that movie???  Prices are fair so if pools aren't your thing it's a good choice, but if it's summer and you're jonesing for good pool time, look elsewhere.
Halloween weekend in the 33rd floor Apex Suite.. . There is no way to beat Planet Hollywood's location and things to do. Large Casino, shops and restaurants all around the miracle mile, starbucks by the front desk, Pin Up pizza and Pinks outside that makes perfect hangover food, ABC stores to ensure you have absolutely everything you need without having to even step outside. And if you do step outside, you are right in the middle of the strip! 10 minute walk to the bellagio or cosmo, 15 to ceasers, paris right next door.  It's excellent.. . If you do end up wanting to splurge, the Apex Suite is where you want to be. We did the 2 bedroom extender, over 2,000 sq feet, iPod dock, gaming tables, huge tv's, and amazing views. We could watch the bellagio fountains from the living room! Had a group of 9 (4 girls 5 guys - early 20's mind you) that all slept in this suite without bumping heads!. . Don't want to walk through the sales people to get to the front desk? Get valet service for your car, it's FREE and they work off of tips. If the lot says 'FULL', proceed to go in because they still offer it to guests staying at the hotel!. . Also, check in can take a little bit of time, but nothing ridiculous. The key is to stand where they can see you and get their attention, no that's not ideal but it's not a big enough draw back for me to lower my rating for this hotel.  Friendly people behind the desk, helped me with everything I needed.. . I would definitely stay here again!
Great stay from start to finish! Beautiful hotel, great upgrade to a room with the BEST view of the Bellagio fountains! Thanks To Jameson who was very friendly and helpful at the front desk. Awesome staff! Not to mention the shopping mall attached was awesome!
I loved Planet Hollywood! We stayed here for Spring break one year and had so much fun. Having been back to Las Vegas several times since then, PH always has the youngest crowd, staying up until the wee hours of the morning, when everything else gets pretty slow and quiet around 4 am. Planet Hollywood has a great atmosphere and probably the most convenient location on the strip in regards to distance to the other casinos and restaurants. Our strip view from the room was great, I think we paid for that view, though. The room as well as the rest of the casino were perfectly clean and maintained. I've stayed somewhere new each visit to Las Vegas, but I would definitely stay here again. It's fun for groups. It's just a fun casino!
Third time I've stayed here in the past several years the rooms are looking more run down everytime. definitely needs to be updated and have some maintenance done to bring it back up to how it was when It was the Aladdin.. everything else in the public areas and the staff was fine
Great people,  very helpful staff! Room was very clean and very nice. Food was fantastic at Planet Dailies with great service. Can't wait to go back again. Hip Strip view at the hotel is highly recommended! !
$22.40 early check-in fee. $24.94 mandatory daily resort fee - includes WiFi, access to the pool, and unlimited local calls.. $5.00 minimum Internet kiosk if you need to print your boarding pass. . See the pattern here?  Talk about how to nickel and dime a person.. . Of the three fees above, we only found value in the early check in fee.  Standard check-in is at 4pm.  We arrived at 11am from our SFO flight.. . Our room was the Hollywood Hip Room which is a standard room, part of our Costco Travel package. You can upgrade for an additional fee.. . Big con - smoke rises.  Our hotel room was on the 31st floor.  When you wake up in the morning, you can smell the cigarette smoke.  Doesn't choke you but who wants to smell smoke. . . Planet Hollywood is part of the Total Rewards program under Caesar hotel and casino now. You can use the casino issued players card at over 30 different properties.
1)  Resort fees.  Come on.  You're going to charge me $25 for (a) a pool that is closed and (b) 512K wifi (yes, that's a "K").  Seriously?  With a straight face?. . 2)  Loud rooms.  I could clearly hear conversations in neighboring rooms and in the hallway.. . 3)  Try replacing the toiletries.  I'm there for four days; I shouldn't have to beg for shampoo.. . I used to recommend the PH.  It's in a good mid-strip location.  There's decent music on the PA (Bowie, Costello, Ramones, etc.), but it's pretty worn down these days.  There are better choices these days.
We didnt say here, but we sure wish we did.  . We stayed at the Monte Carlo and found ourselves coming to Planet Hollywood almost everyday for something!. . The casino floor is beautiful and very lively!. We had a couple of meals at Earl of Sandwich.. We also had dinner at Gordon Ramsy's Burgr.. We saw Brittney Spears at the theater at Planet Hollywood.. . As you can see, there is a ton to do here for the younger crowd and I would recommend staying here if you are looking for some lively action.. . In terms of location on the strip - Planet Hollywood is in a great location! You are right by the Bellagio and only a few minute walk to Cesar's palace.  The other nice part is that the casino floor is very close to the strip, unlike at Bellagio and Cesars where it seems like its a mile walk up the door!. . We also had an encounter with the front desk and they were wonderful! . So very friendly!. . Looking forward to staying here on our next trip!
Not the best hotel I've stayed in (I would give the room 2.3-3 stars), but the service was amazing. I came here on a business trip and my executive assistant booked my stay for the day before I flew into town. Therefore when iarrived my reservation was canceled. Amy, at the front desk went above and beyond to find me a room, she was friendly and professional. It was a great experience.
The shops and attractions are what initially encouraged me to book at Planet Hollywood (aside from Ms. Britney Spears), especially since it's in the heart of the strip. You're in walking distance to it all! Planet Hollywood's Rock Bar, La Salsa Cantina, The Shops, Cabo Wabo, and (the late) Eli Roth's Goretoriumall captivated me. These places alone I will come to everytime I return to Vegas. . The hotel, however, is less than satisfactory. The rooms are quite dated and worn. If there is more than one person in a room forget about closet space! We had no refrigerator and no microwave. We were continuously having issues with our safe constantly jamming. Towels were scarce. . Even though Planet Hollywood is home to many of my favorite spots, I do not think I will be staying there again. I was definitely fooled by the glitz and glamour of the casino, the actual rooms are nothing like. Great place for shopping, dining, and entertainment; not for staying.
Wow what a blast I had. Winning a few dollars at the black jack tables. Free drinks. And awesome staff.
Ok , here's the break down. . $20 early check in fee .. Wtf never heard of that. . $25 resort fee. This is for your "free wifi " and you get speeds of 512 kb with it. Is this the 1990's ??!! . In this day in age wifi should be free and fast. Couldn't even look a picture on sites like this one due them taking forever to load. . As for the rooms they are super dated and run down. This hotel needs a serious facelift. . The only reason I did not give it one star was its location on the strip and the miracle mile mall is a great place to walk around , have a drink and people watch. . Next trip it will be back to the Cosmo.
Awesome stay, the girl who checked us in made an awesome job at a first impression of Las Vegas. She helped with direct us with things to do whether it cost money or just free attractions. Gave an upgrade and the room faced the strip so we got to see the Bellagio water show ever night without the crowd. The room was actually nice and clean and the bathroom was clean as well. . . Negatives:. The only thing wrong with the room was the water pressure of the shower head, it was so powerful I felt like my skin was going to come off. Literally.  . And wtf do we pay for amenities we don't even use? We should get to pick and choose what we'd use, I never went to the pool, gym, used the wifi, or all that other crap. I mean if we're shopping and gambling that should be enough, you blood sucking monsters. . . Other than that:. A great place to stay, it has a mall in it. Lots of places to eat. If you don't want to walk too far to a liquor store there is one downstairs. Live environment and doesn't smell like butt, cause New York New York smelled horrible every time we were in there. There's Bar and Grills at almost every exit on the main strip so you never really have to walk too far. In a great spot right across all the main attractions. Perfect for the Bellagio water show.
There is ROT associated with this hotel.  . . The superficial elements are one thing (and they leave much to be desired) - but rather I'm talking instead about its management, and some very nasty tactics they  used to tack over a hundred dollars in extra fees onto a PRE-PAID hotel bill.  The whole incident was very "unkosher," to put it nicely.  (I'd use a harsher term, but I'll refrain here...you can probably imagine.)  I have the backup in writing, so I've taken the matter to my credit card company.  But adding insult to injury, the hotel's Assistant Manager stood back and said "Not our problem." Such actions should be condemned in the strongest possible terms, if only because they are the precise opposite of hospitality.  Disgusting.  Despicable.  Worth avoiding by staying elsewhere.. . If someone from the hotel were to contact me I can provide additional details, including the names of the individuals in question.
I recently stayed 2 nights at the Hotel on the 38th floor. I spent a little over $200 for the two night (including a $25 per night resort fee). When we arrived we noticed that the room was the last floor on the North Bank of elevators. Apparently there is some kind of industrial complex above the 38th floor and it literally shook the walls of the room and made the loudest rumbling scraping noises every 15-20 seconds. We couldn't even sleep. . When we checked out we mentioned how terrible the room was and asked what was on the 39th floor. The check-out person told us "Well if you're a light sleeper you should have told us." So apparently they know that the 38th floor has noise issues but they put guests there anyway and if you don't complain then you're SOL. . Also, the glasses in the room had lip marks on them, so we had to hand wash them with a rag and soap in order to drink from them.. Would not recommend.
I remember staying at this hotel back when it was the Aladdin, and when it became PH, I was a bit curious how they integrated the "Aladdin" theme into their overall space, because they didn't change the Miracle Mile shops or their buffet, which is still named "Spice Market.". . We finally had the chance this past weekend to stay, since it was one of the more reasonably priced hotels for a trip on a whim, and it was a great location - super central, close to the Cosmopolitan (where we like to eat and drink), Paris (more eating) and Aria (even more eating).  Husband booked us a Strip-view room, and we were in the north tower on the 37th floor.. . Great views - we were directly across from the Cosmo and could see (and hear) the Bellagio fountains.  However, the amazingness of the room pretty much stops there.. . -The bathrooms were outdated. -We had a nice little accumulation of dust on the side tables (and even after housecleaning came by, they were still dusty), and the entertainment unit/shelving looked pretty tired. -There wasn't much of a theme to the room, basically one or two posters of old movies. -Saturday night there was this strange whooshing sound around our window - it did that every few minutes for about an hour, then went away. -The worst part was when I turned on the sink Saturday night and no hot water came out.  I waited a few minutes, then gave up and continued to brush my teeth.  The next morning, still no hot water (just from the sink, the shower was fine).  We told the front desk upon checking out, so hopefully they went and checked it out.. . Basically stay at PH for the location and price, as it's cheaper than Cosmo and Aria but still near shopping and good food.  But for a nicer, more modern stay, go to Aria or Cosmo.
We stayed this last weekend at PH and had an awesome experience. The room was clean and the bed super comfy.  Loved the oversized bathtub and the Strip view. The halls smell of smoke but no issue with that in the room. Friendly staff. ..Great location. Skip Planet Dailies-slow service andthe food is not so great.
I paid about $70 per night . For that amount it is a good value . Great location and pretty darn good restaurants . Gordon RAmsey burger was very good.. Negatives. The wi if is very slow, and the guest hallways could use an update.. Overall a good value.
First time we stayed here it was during construction when they first opened. Since we come to Vegas a lot I like to try new hotels each time. Wanted to give PH another try since a strip view room was pretty reasonable. Line for check in moves faster than others I have experienced so that was ok. Valet and baggage claim was great throughout our entire stay. A little disappointed blinds were broke when we arrived and had to call maintenance to fix. What's the point of strip view if i cannot see out of window. They did fix it within a couple hours so I was satisfied, housekeeping was great, staff is friendly, I think the rooms could use a little upgrading, the bathtub is HUGE and the view from 35th floor was cool. Able to see Bellagio fountains also. Just a note there is an old Paramount picture outside of South elevators and if you look and find Robin Williams on it you can clearly see he is the only unhappy person in the picture, that was very sad to see, because it was a long time ago.
I really like this hotel/casino. The rooms are nice, not that you spend much timethere. The bathtub was enormous...and I like a good soak. The bed was really comfy. And the shades keep out that pesky sun, trying to wake me before 10am.. . The casino dealers are very friendly. I always have a good time playing there. It'll be my future Vegas home base.
Younger party crowd casino hotel.  We went here in the summer on a weekend fri to sat. . . Pools 2 stars... Pool was older.  One pool was a drunk fest party pool, and the other was more mellow.  Pools are older and not glamorous.  Pool deck is HUGE.  Pools were clean and maintained given the party atmosphere.  The pool deck did have a nice view of the strip.. . Casino 4 stars... Casino and lobby are nice here, and it has a party atmosphere.  Clean and fairly new.  Koi restaurant on the mezzanine was good.. . Room. 3 stars.  We got a regular room, and it was moderately new, but clean.  Bathroom had a nice shower stall and was big.. . Planet Hollywood is a better hotel than flamingo or ballys, but not as nice as mirage or MGM.
Have yet to spend the night at Planet Hollywood's hotel.  Their casino and Miracle Miles shops are a different story.  They have a good selection of shops to browse and restaurants to eat at.. . I like the casino here.  Okay, I am bias.  I have gambled here 3 times in the past.  Each time, I finished with more money than I started with which is a very good thing.  The smoke filled casino does not bother me when I am winning.  . . Anyways, Planet Hollywood lately tends to be a place we walk to when we are in Vegas.  Great location in the heart of the Strip.
YIKES. We had a very bad experience here, unfortunately.. . I went for a work trip and you can't imagine the thrill I had knowing we were staying in the same hotel that Britney is preforming at (the teenage girl in me is still star struck) but honestly, I've never had a worse experience in Vegas. The first day our room wasn't even ready when we arrived, by the third day our room hadn't been cleaned once, and the fourth day our neighbors took it upon themselves to hotbox their hotel room which led to the vent pumping their smoke into our room. At first the hotel did NOTHING about our neighbors and told us that this was impossible. Finally after much pestering they sent a secutriy guard up who immediately confirmed our suspicion and told the front desk to move us. They then refused to give us adjoining rooms like we had reuqested when we booked the hotel and didn't even offer us a discount despite spending 5 nights there! . . Terrible, terrible, terrible!
The only reason why this hotel is getting 3 stars is because of its proximity to Urban Outfitters.  Right on the strip, many of the popular hotels and eating areas are located within walking distance.  And my favorite store Urban Outfitters is right downstairs in the Miracle Mile Shops.  So if you're looking for convenience, location, and price, Planet Hollywood is a great place to stay....if you don't care about lavish amenities.  When I booked the hotel, it averaged around $80-$115 a night.  Very reasonable for a strip hotel.. . Yet...this hotel comes with crappy old movie memorabilia inside your hotel room.  We had some obscure 1995 Cindy Crawford movie poster hanging in the bathroom, an entire costume/outfit from the movie glued to the freaking wall (taking up an entire wall space where a window could have gone), and a Cindy Crawford book permanently implanted inside a table.  Not the most classy hotel room decor.  The windows (or should I say window, as in ONE) were too small, which was unfortunate because it had a great view of the Bellagio Fountain.  You also could hear the water running very loudly in the adjacent hotel rooms.  It actually sounded like Niagara Falls was in the next room over.  They need to work on sound-proofing the rooms because we could hear youngins clubbing it up down below.  Not pleasant when you're too old for that shit and you want a good night's sleep.. . There was only one sink, but a separate shower and tub, which is always nice.  Two sinks would have been nicer though, because sharing sinks with the hubby isn't fun.  They do have 24 hour room service, which actually had great pizza that was very similar to Round Table.  I can't complain much though; the room was clean and the maid service adequate.  3 stars all around.
Let's just say, it's refreshing to step into the lovely Planet Hollywood and to be embraced with quality decor, great service and overall good energy and vibes.. . I come to Vegas all the time, since I am from Los Angeles, and have tried a variety of places....I have two high strong recommendations. . 1) planet hollywood. 2) aria. . . Have a great Vegas trip and good luck ;)
PROS: Affordable room rates, GREAT location on The Strip, connected to the "Miracle Mile" shops, has a Gordon Ramsey Restaurant, and $9 worth of Starbucks cash daily.. . CONS: HORRIBLE PARKING for guests,  the Hotel Valet fills up quickly and thus closes allowing only for self parking.  This was a killer and may not book with them again.
