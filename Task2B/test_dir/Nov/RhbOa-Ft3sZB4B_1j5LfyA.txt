This place is a dream come true... Greeted at the door by a gentleman by name of Nick. . Restaurants could take customer service lessons from Nick and his staff.. I had the P.B. & Banana Pancakes..off da chain. . Wish they had a one these back in Frisco... Thanks again for great food and service.
Super friendly people & huge portions for breakfast. It's close, but not on the strip so prices aren't nuts. Would definitely come here again!
Mr. Mama's is extraordinary! The model for running a successful food business should be pretty straight forward:  provide stellar customer service, operate with efficiency, keep the restaurant clean and above all, serve the best food on the planet.  Why is this so hard to achieve?  I don't know the answer, but I do know that Mr. Mamma's has figured it out.  I wouldn't have expected such a down-to-earth, truly fabulous establishment with reasonable prices in Las Vegas.  I continue to be amazed...
Breakfast done right! Friendliest staff I have ever come across. Very knowledgeable servers and everyone smiles crazy concept. I had the biscuits and gravy which rival the best I have ever eaten. Huge pieces of bacon and sausage. I also tried the breakfast burrito which was really good. When I'm out in Vegas again I know where I am getting breakfast. Thanks!
Found this place on Yelp thought over 800 people gave it high ratings it must be good. Well ..IT WAS! I had the French Toast , 2 eggs, and Hash Browns . French Toast was amazing thick piece fluffy bread - perfect egg ration with a hint of cinnamon- The eggs are also delish fluffy (scrambled ) with parsley gave it a fresh taste. The Hash Browns I ordered them crispy they were good not great - next time I'm doubling up on the French Toast and skip the Hash. . . Service : Amazing - Friendly , feel good type of place!
Awesome! We had the MAMAs Sandwich and the steak & eggs. Both were superb! The staff was very friendly and attentive.. . Super Fruhstuck! Sowohl das Sandwich als auch das Steak mit Eiern waren klasse. Die Preise sind mehr als akzeptabel und der Service ist freundlich und zuvorkommend. Parkplatze direkt vor der Tur.
Great place!  Went based on reviews and we all loved it. Good service. Short wait for a table (10min). I got the cheese steak and next time would get breakfast. My 2 others with me got breakfast and I has a taste. That's why I say it.
Leaving to go home from vegas, stopped here for a quick breakfast.greeted at door by owner.  Food was perfectly prepared and served in a flash. Will defenitely go there next time in vegas.
Friendly service, manager or owner came by to check on us. Good omelette, nice balance between eggs and content, moist and fluffy not over cooked and just eggs as you find in many restaurants. Choose home fries over hash browns, home fries were well seasoned and yummy, hash browns were cooked perfectly but under seasoned. Why a three and not a four? The coffee, not horrible but just meh. Typical diner coffee and a bit weak. I would go back and give something else a try.
If you want a hearty breakfast,  come here! Food is great and service is superb!  :)  I recommend the homemade chili and ice coffee here!
Came here on Yelp recommendations and did not disappoint, Solid breakfast, great waitress, and friendly atmosphere.
Good food friendly atmosphere.  I will be back to this one.  I had one of my favs biscuits and gravy!  I think I will branch out next time.
Do yourself a favor, ask to sample the gravy...it's ridiculous. I would have given it five stars had the pancakes been better. They seemed to be missing some flavor depth. Ham is good, eggs are good, service is good. . . I also like that the place doesn't try to cram 400 people into the place (which they could). . . Overall, their Yelp reputation is well deserved. . . P.S. They're moving in two months (today is Nov 7, 2014).
Food was great and the service is amazing. Staff is so friendly I would come just because of them! I had the mamas sandwich and it was perfect for lunch. Big portion so I gave half to my coworker and she loved it too. Glad to have found this place!
The wife and I were looking for a breakfast joint off the strip and found Mama's via Yelp ....glad we did ! The service was over the top for a joint like this ...the guy at the door was totally cool and seated us as soon as a table cleared.The servers also care for each others tables without asking ...that was a nice touch.Our drinks were never empty.. . . I had the biscuits and gravy ....definitely a different take on the gravy.I believe it was maple enhanced making it sweet and savory and piled onto some fresh biscuits...toallly bomb gravy! The bacon was fried perfectly ...."stood" up when you held it but not overcooked or limp... I swear our food came in less than 5 minutes so we were in and out of there fast.. . Loved this joint ...well worth the 10 minute drive from the strip and a 1/3 of the price as well !
Very very good food ! . I were there for breakfast. . I eate the pancakes. A friend had the cheese omelettes with American cheese. We will come back.
We found this place because of my friends that had visited the during a trade show. First off, this place is well worth the little out of the way drive off the strip. We were greeted by Nick, the owner of this fine establishment. He was very helpful and made the little wait enjoyable. We sat down and the staff was very fast and courteous. I ordered the French toast and eggs and my gf ordered the Cinnamon bun and side of ham. Both very very very very delicious. This will become a regular stop for us everything we come to Vegas. Keep up the good work Nick!!!
We found Mr. Mamas on Yelp and decided to give them a try as they are so highly rated. We were met at the door by Nick, and he's very nice and personable. We were given a 45 minute wait time but were sat in 25. There's plenty of staff and good customer service.  The food is good and plentiful. Nothing really exemplary about the place for us but still, no complaints.
After searching for the perfect breakfast place for a year, we've finally found it! Mr. Mama's is THE place for breakfast in Las Vegas. . . We were a party of two and were promised 45 minutes, but waited an hour to get a seat here on a Sunday morning (we arrived around 10:20). While we waited, we were given a menu to look at while more and more people arrived and joined us to wait to be seated. . . Once we were seated, we were promptly greeted and given drinks. Service was quick and hospitable and our glasses were never empty!  We ordered a cinnamon roll, breakfast burrito, and full order of biscuits and gravy.  Everything was great and we left with full tummies- there was waaaaaay too much food, but we didn't mind because it was delicious!
Stopped at Mr. Mamma's for brunch today, which is almost hidden in a small strip mall.  The owner (who happens to live a couple of developments down from me in Henderson) greeted us as we walked through the door, added us to the wait list, and gave us a menu to peruse while we waited.  He advised that there would be a 15 minute wait, but it turned out to be less than 10 minutes.  While we waited I noticed that he interacted warmly with everyone who came in and kept a keen eye on the food coming out of the open kitchen as well as on the service.  This is an owner who takes great pride in his restaurant (IMO) and I appreciate that.  Once seated our waitress was quick to take our order and bring our drinks.  The iced tea was fresh brewed and I am told the coffee was very good ($2.50 each).. . We started with the cinnamon roll to share.  This thing is huge!  It came out hot and fresh.  The icing was too sweet for my taste, but I ate around the icing without issue. $3.50. . I had the short stack pancakes (2 cakes) & eggs with extra crispy bacon.  The pancakes were also huge, but they were fluffy and had a nice traditional flavor.  I almost got through one!  The scrambled eggs were good and the bacon was thick cut.  $7.45. . My dining companion had the steak and eggs w/ hashbrowns.  He advised that the hashbrowns were fantastic, and that the steak was okay, but he would likely order something different in the future. $9.95. . We felt that the pricing was reasonable, the staff fast and friendly, and the food was good.  I like that you can order breakfast all day, but the burgers and some of the other lunch orders coming out of the kitchen also looked appetizing, so I may try one of those next time.. . As we were leaving, the owner shook our hands andasked about our experience.  Nice to see he cares this much.  We will be back.
As soon as we walked in I had a feeling I was going to love this spot. We had about a 5 min wait for our table, and during those 5 min my boyfriend had a conversation with the owner about what he should order. The lamb gyro was on the specials board and he was talking about getting that...the owner said he had to be honest and it wasn't his fav. and recommended another sandwich except wrapped in tortilla and grilled. Then went on to say that if he didn't love it that he (the owner) would buy his meal. Needless to say my bf found it to be amazing. I had eggs toast hash browns and French toast and holy cow: those hash browns were AMAMZING. Whatever they season with is perfect. Everyone I was with was beyond happy and even more happy with the check when it arrived. Absolutely recommend this spot. The only downside and reason I'm giving 4 stars versus 5....I really love some mimosa with my brunch and this spot doesn't serve any alcohol.
They critics don't lie. This place was cheap and the food was fantastic. I had the Cali Omelet and my Wife had the Greek Omelet. The service and good and the food was super good!!! Take the time to get off the strip and come and enjoy a really good breakfast!
Quiet off the strip breakfast spot. Food was good not great. Their pancakes are huge and service is excellent. We got the veggie omelette and it was nothing special.
We are in Vegas visiting from Virginia and we decided to try something just out of the city. Found this place on yelp.  The service was great. We were greeted by Nick(the owner)and he even shared some of his family history. Very nice.  Between the four of us we order a basic breakfast of bacon and eggs, biscuits and gravy and French toast.  Oh and I almost forgot the huge cinnamon rolls!!  The food came out fast and  everything was cooked perfectly. If I am ever in the area again I will definitely be stopping by
Great Bfast spot. I go there twice a week at least, always satisfied. The gravy is like nothing else. yum!
Quite probably the best breakfast in LV &  definitely the best and friendliest service!
ANOTHER BIG TIME FAIL FROM MY YELP COMMUNITY!!. . Craving some serious breakfast after a long night of partying. I had already bookmarked this restaurant prior to my Las Vegas Trip based on the stellar reviews. We ventured away from the strip to this restaurant located in an industrial area inside a small strip mall don't flinch youmight miss it. . . My wife and I arrived at 1pm., placed our name on the wait list, Very friendly gentlemen greets us and tells us there is a 25min. wait. I says no problem. We were seated within the time frame, our waitress takes our order right away as we were starving. I usually stop at Starbucks to get a coffee when eating at most breakfast spots as the coffee tends to be weak but I overlooked my instincts lazily and decided to try theirs. Well unsurprisingly the Coffee was super weak. As soon as I added creamer it turned milky instantly. My Bad $2.50.. . Food/Prices- I opted for the DENVER OMELETTE with home fries and Toast Price was decent under $9. I asked the waitress if I can sub bacon for the ham that comes with the denver she said no problem.  Our order took a little while to come out. The presentation looked great big portion for sure; better than it tasted. My OMELETTE- TOTAL grease pit, they used tons of oil to cook it, plus the cheese stuffed inside was your poor quality cheese used at most LA style burger joints that increased the greasiness further. First couple bites were very mushy eggs were not cooked that well, upon further inspection I also noticed very little bacon in my omelette so I began to open it up and noticed they didnt even cook the bacon at all prior to stuffing it in my omelette. The potatoes were the only thing that came out good they were hot and crispy. I couldnt finish it even though I was starving i did enjoy the potatoes but was very dissapointed. . . My wife ordered the French toast special, served with Eggs and Bacons under $9. Her eggs also cooked with tons of oil, bacon was good. The French toast that everyone raves about was weak yo. First of all it was served cold, next it had no flavor you couldnt add enough syrup to give it flavor. No moistness, no tastes of eggs or cinnamon ever touching the bread. Maybe they dipped the texas toast in milk and pan fried not sure. Was a total fail. . . Waitress came by asked us how our food was, I told her I was disappointed with the french toast coming out so cold. She opted to warm it up for us but by this time I was completely disillusioned with my meal. I decided to pay, leave and will not come back. . . Prices are Good; Portions are Big, Service Is Good, However, I prefer quality over quantity food was not on point. Sorry Yelpers this was a fail dont do it! Should have tried the breakfast spot at my hotel not worth the hassle of leaving the Strip.
The biscuits and gravy here are AMAZING. No seriously, biscuits and gravy is my go to dish when ranking a place. This is the best I have had. They nail the biscuit, and the gravy is rich and flavorful. My wife had said that the omelettes are absolutely top notch. We have eaten breakfast here every day since finding this gem. . . The staff are cheerful, friendly and fast. If you are looking for a great breakfast spot, look no farther.
Great service.  You feel like family as soon as you hit the door. Food was great, with a very big selection for breakfast. Owned by a Greek boy from Michigan. We will definitely be back
Great prices, fast friendly service. Def recommend! My husband loved the fluffy pancakes!  I am always looking for a place to cater breakfast for my sales team so I will be calling Mr Mamas very soon!
Very nice man at front door managing the line, kept Ya informed of wait times etc was very efficient and friendly.  Food was amazing, and didn't take long for how busy they were.  Waitress forgot my toast and due to that she gave me my drink for free because she felt it was the right thing to do. . . Highly recommend and would go back if I lived closer.. . I had the chicken fried steak it was very very good and the gravy is also amazing
Thus place is so great.. great atmosphere, and food. When we visit vegas again, we will definitely be back here for breakfast.  :-)
What a great experience we had. My Wife and I love good food, and nice people, and this place has them both. . . We had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Cali Omelette. Both absolutely delicious. Not greasy like many breakfast places in town. Lots of flavor and spices. And the Cinnamon Roll was also amazing. Very soft, warm and fluffy. . . The people are very nice and there is plenty of staff so that they can spend more than the usual attention on each guest. The owner Nick is such a nice guy, and he has a great philosophy; focus on his product and the rest will follow. He spends his money on his staff, which makes the product amazing for his guests, and they leave happy and tell the friends and then yelp about it. That is money better spent than on advertising a poor quality product. . . Definitely recommend this anyone who loves good breakfast and nice people for a great overall experience.
All I can say is amazing all the way around. Nick which was I assume the manager and the hostess was so welcoming and checked on us at all times. The food is delicious. Only thing as a warning the hash browns have oregano on them.
We went here for the first time today, and it was really good. You have to try the biscuits and gravy. I had the veggie omelette, and the potatoes which I really liked. My dad had the chili omelette and the chili was amazing. The husband had the sausage and eggs and he really liked it. Everything is a decent price, for the 3 of us we spent less then $40. It was about a 30-40 minute wait, but I think it was worth it. I would come back next time I'm in Vegas. If your a local, I would get it to go, so you don't have to wait. The owner greets you at the door and was nice, he was honest about that wait, they were so busy that people didn't want to wait and left.
All I'm going to say is Mama's Breakfast Burrito, best ever. Do it!
Stopped in for a quick breakfast while on the road, and was pleasantly surprised by this little haven amongst mediocre restaurants. . I was greeted by the owner as I entered and he did a great job checking up on me throughout the meal. Ordered coffee, and the short stack combo with Pancakes, eggs, and bacon. While the eggs were a little on the dry side, everything else was cooked perfectly and tasted great for being a traditional breakfast. On top of it all, the prices were VERY reasonable - paying under $13 for a VERY filling breakfast with the combo, coffee, and a muffin.. If I find myself in the area again, I'll definitely stop here for a quick, delicious, friendly, and affordable meal!
Had the Chicken fried steak after seeing so many reviews.  It was very good.  Next time I will have the biscuits and gravy.  The same gravy comes on both and boy IS IT GOOOOOD!  The service staff is friendly and the it did not take long to get our meals.  Good food at a good value.  Not much more you could as for.
Super Yummy, fast and very friendly service. Large portions, enough that we took some home and the kiddos ate it for lunch. My sons french toast was even good leftover
This place is always packed and for good reason.The friendly service begins with a greeting and a smile from the owner. Coffee is great here, according to my dining companion, but alas no herbal tea for me. On to the food, though. Today we had western omelets. They arrived quickly (with a smile) and were oh so tasty. Nicely seasoned and filled with enough veggies and sausage to add to the flavor but without overwhelming the eggs.
No glitz and no glamour here. It good hardy breakfast food. It is only a few miles from the strip and I am tired of the same old thing and I was not disappointed.
Very nice experience overall. Food was great, generous portions and very nice staff. Would definitely go here again if I get the chance.
Cool owner, great service and ALWAYS packed....that said, the food is as average as average can be...did I mention its always packed....
Good food, great service! The host at the door did a wonderful job of keeping us posted with the wait time and made sure we were fine with the time frame he quoted.He under promised and over delivered and we were promptly seated .The server was equally efficient, she was quick and attentive and the food arrived minutes after we ordered . Wonderful experience from start to finish .
Probably the best breakfast place in Vegas. Definitely the best I've had. Great service, delicious food and low prices. I had the Cali omelet and my bf had the chicken fried steak. They even have French Vanilla coffee creamer. Definitely a great "hole in the wall" find!
This was the absolute BEST breakfast we have had in a LONG time. The pancakes were nice and fluffy, the eggs were delicious and the bacon was cooked to perfection! The guy at the door is a great host and pretty funny. The wait staff is very attentive and everyone seemed to be helping each other. We will definitely be back!
Thank you my fellow yelpers for the right on reviews. The customer service was great and everybody was friendly. Nick is very proud of his establishment and also shared a family story of the pics he has on wall. I love the fact of how spacious it is and they do not pack you in like sardines. If this was a breakfast spot in Los Angeles they would have added at least 15 more tables so that when you get in and out your seat it's like moving down a movie aisle row with butt in people's face, ridiculous!!! But anyway our fabulous waitress informed us they are moving to a bigger location next year, so I'm sure this will be even better. So I had the biscuits n gravy, they let me sample it first because it is a distinct flavor, and something different. Flavorful and fresh plus they have nice size portions. We will return because we're always in Vegas and I have to try that cinnamon roll totally forgot when we were there.
The Greek omelet was amazing. Seasoned perfectly, cooked to perfection. I'll come for breakfast next time I'm in town.
Went for breakfast based on the yelp reviews and was one of our least favorite breakfasts in Vegas. French toast was good as was the hash browns. Bacon was overcooked, dry, flavorless and tough and didn't even finish half of the order. Biscuits and sausage gravy is on the menu but they warn you the gravy has meat other than sausage and it was not good. Salt and pepper helped a little but walking out, none of the four people who ordered the gravy was eating it. Not sure the point of having a product that you warn people about when they order. The biscuits were dry and overly brown so overall not much flavor. . . Prices were good, and fairly busy and seemed like mostly egg and potatoes were being enjoyed but also saw a lot of food pushed aside, pancakes included.
Friendly family fun business!  Coffee was exceptional!  Service was attentive and FAST!!!!  Served French Vanilla Creamer.  Served everything in the menu so I could get a hamburger and my daughter could get the Philly Cheese Steak Burrito and my husband could get Waffles.  The Bacon was perfectly cooked with a nice thick rind.  Get there early or prepare to wait cuz it is popular but worth it.
Very friendly quick service.  Came here once before and the kids were the ones who wanted to come back.  Great omelets and meatless friendly which is a plus for me.
First off, the customer service here is great! That was the best part of the experience. The staff is very friendly and accommodating and I really appreciated that. . . The reason I'm giving Mr. Mama's 3 stars is because the food did not live up to the hype. It wasn't BAD food, by any means. It just wasn't amazing, like the Yelp reviews led me to believe. We had the cinnamon roll, biscuits and gravy, and the Philly cheesesteak burrito. The cinnamon roll was okay, but not better than a Cinnabun. The biscuits and gravy were a little bland, so I had to add quite a bit of salt. The Philly burrito was good, but like I said, nothing worth driving to the other side of town for. . . If you live near by, it's definitely worth a try! But if you live further away (like we do) hold off and try something closer to your neighborhood :-)
Really Great customer service! And food was out in a timely manner.  We heard their french toast and Cali omelet were the best here.  They weren't lying. Eventful was good. Definitely will come back next time I'm in Vegas
