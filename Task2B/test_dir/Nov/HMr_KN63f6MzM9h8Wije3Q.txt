ARGH. Difficile d'evaluer le New York New York. Il est tellement beau de l'exterieur! Le detail est bien travaille : on a vraiment l'impression d'avoir un petit New York a cote de nous: la statue de la liberte, le Brooklyn Bridge, le Chrysler building... Tout y est ! 'J'etais emerveillee en arrivant devant.. . Mais en y entrant, un peu comme le Paris, je n'ai pas vraiment trouve de choses ressemblantes comme a NY: dans le concept oui, le fond est respecte: les immeubles et les escaliers a l'exterieur, les pizzeria, les vendeurs de hot dog, mais voila rien de ressemblant sur la forme. J'ai ete tres decue.
Loved this place and the vibe. The New York theme is charming. A great place for my first trip to Vegas. It's also connected to the MGM which is nice.
My boyfriend and I decided to come here to try our luck at the roulette tables here and this place is the worse casino ever to gamble.  When we walked in we noticed that NOBODY was here gambling but that didn't stop us.  We went to a roulette table where it was a $10 minimum and decided to play.  First off the tables seemed filthy and dirty with stains all over like they don't know how to take care of their tables.  My boyfriend accidentally spilled his beer on the table and the dealer looked at him with a disgusted look and rolled her eyes at him and off top that was the first negative thing I noticed.  He continued to play at the same table and was standing at the corner of the edge of the table where its hard to reach all the numbers on the other side.  Usually when he can't reach all the numbers he gives his chips to the dealer and tells her which numbers he wants his chips placed (which is NEVER EVER a problem at any other casino but here) and after a couple of times she seemed very snobby and gave him attitude about it.  She actually told my boyfriend to move closer to the middle so that she wouldn't have to place any of his chips for him because it was so hard for her to do! I guess it was so difficult for her to do because that means she would have to pay attention to what's going on with the game.  After she told my boyfriend to move with such harsh attitude that's when we decided to leave! Worse customer service ever!!!!!!! Who the hell hires these people?! And they wonder why people don't gamble at their casino.  . . New York, New York please get your sh!t together.  I will never be coming back here for anything.  Worse casino ever.
These people are deceiving & cheats! They promise you certain deals then do not honor them. We had to spend our limited time by going to the front desk 3 times to fight for all their hidden charges. Read the fine print!!! They deny they ever said things! Record them if you go here, we will never stay here again!
This is my home away from home when in Las Vegas . I guess the New Yorker in me calks out to visit here. I love the atmosphere, though the  drinks in some of the bars can get pricey, the lobby bar is the most reasonable. I love the New York decore, it's a must stop for me .
This hotel gets 3 stars. If you are expecting a luxurious hotel, this is not the place to stay. Book a room at the Mirage for that. They have much nicer rooms for the same price. We got the king suite. Very tiny. Not good if you will be spending most of your time in your room. But if you want a cheaper place to stay and will be out and about while you stay here, the NYNY would be adequate.
I had pretty low expectations for this property and was pleasantly surprised!. Don't expect accomodatations along the lines of Wynn or Venetian (I'd be more apt to compare NY, NY with Planet Hollywood or TI) but this resort did not disappoint during our one-night stay in October 2014.. We stayed here for Red Bull Air Race for one night (company paid--we paid for Friday at the Trump) and had a fairly easy time checking in with a pre-paid room, even though the line was long. The associates checked in guests quickly and efficiently and gave us clear and concise information on the hotel, amenities, policies, and directions to our room. . The property itself is a lot cleaner than I remember, but I haven't been to this part of the strip in years (it definitely caters more towards families/tourists vs. the northern side of the strip that's a bit more geared toward the party crowd). The casino was lively and there were plenty of food options within the resort.. We had a room with no view, which was fine because we were barely there the one night. The windows did have a weird red tint which was a littleannoying but not bothersome when the curtains were closed. The room was pretty standard--don't expect a massive layout or lots of luxury. The bed was comfy and there were plenty of easily-accessible outlets (which is surprisingly rare!). The bathroom was pretty basic and the toiletries were ok. The water pressure was actually much better than some of the pricier resorts I've stayed at!. Room service was surprisingly cheap and very fast, albeit standard diner-tasting food.  They deliver pizzas late which we definitely utilized post-club (it came REALLY fast!).. Parking was really easy as well. . One bonus for a Kings fan from LA--they actually had Fox Sports West in their cable package so I got to watch my game! (although it wasn't HD--crappy quality hockey is better than no hockey!). New York, New York wouldn't be my first choice when staying in Vegas but I certainly would not rule it out when looking for a cheap, no-frills stay.
We checked in with ease yesterday.  While checking out the view from our room there was a light knock at the door I thought it was next door so I didn't open it. Next thing I know someone is opening our door.  The lady said it was a room check. Weird we have never had that happen.  Decided to watch the Seahawks game but since we are in cardinals nation we had to go to one of the bars downstairs. Fine.  Met some great people and seahawks won.  Even better.  Put 5 bucks in the slots came ahead 12.00. Put 1 more in the big slots won 4 more(then lost it in a different big slot).  All in all so far no major complaints.  Room is clean bathroom looks clean. View is nice although it really sounds like new York with the street noise. But hey we are in vegas right.
I very much enjoyed our stay here. They check in process was really easy and the guy was really nice. We had a very spacious room with a decent view. We had a comfortable bed, staff was great, food selection was great, everything was really, really nice. I'd stay here again.
The free wifi might as well not exist, it works intermittently and is incredibly slow despite full signal. . . The jacuzzi closes at 5 pm, which is absurd.
We didn't stay here but we came to visit specifically for the coaster. It was absolutely amazing. The price is about $14 a person but they do sell all day passes for about $25. Definitely a must do.
Some would say that New York - New York is a little passe, but I would disagree. This is one of the most fun hotels in Vegas. This review is purely on the attractions and casino floor because I've never stayed here, but I'm seriously thinking about it for next time. It's a great location - right in the centre of the strip, not far from MGM, Caesars, Planet Hollywood etc so you can walk right on in. . . One of my favourite things about it is the little fake new york neighbourhood, with the shops and cafes. There is a mexican restaurant somewhere there which makes awesome guacamole and even better sangria. I forget the name. . . My next favourite thing is the goddamn rollercoaster. Which goes THROUGH the casino and is genuinely terrifying. Definitely buy the all day pass (it's like the price of 2 rides) because you will 100% want to go on it more than once, and then it means you can skip the queue for second/third/fourth visits. . . Love it here. I'm sure to swing by every time i'm in town.
I have been wanting to stay at NYNY for the longest time! I'm glad I finally got the chance to book a room here! I went for the Madison Deluxe room and upon arriving after booking through my MLife membership I was greeted by a nice representative! I originally booked for a king but was told they were all out! So because of the request not being granted I was able to get two queens on a high floor providing a very nice strip view as well as a view of the roller coaster! The room itself was very spacious and provided everything i needed just for the short stay! The bathroom is rather small and the fact that the ice machine didn't work was super annoying!! I waited an hour and returned thinking that maybe it needed time to make the ice but this still didn't work! I wasn't going to go to a different floor for ice either! Other than the ice drama and the bathroom being way too small the overall stay was just okay! Maybe I'll try booking the suite with the whirlpool in the middle of the room next time..
It's sort of hard to read a review about a hotel in Vegas.?I have stayed at this hotel dozens of times it's one of my favorite places to stay. It's right across from MGM and it's right off the strip. They have a very nice food court of different restaurants and a lot of little shops. Honestly all the employees I've ever run into here are all very nice. I don't recall ever having a problem with the service at this hotel they've always been very accommodating even giving us a discount on the rooms and things to do out in Vegas. One downside is coming off the elevator from the parking garage there's always a very odd smell when you're walking down the bridge. Parking here is free it seems pretty busy but usually can find a parking space. It's your first time here I would keep her car parked and take a cab or walk so much easier. There's plenty of cabs always waiting in front of the hotel. Rooms are really nice try to get a view of the strip . on the top floors is really nice usually a little more quiet. Staying on the bottom floors it usually gets pretty loud at night with people getting in and partying. Really really comfortable beds. nice flat screen TV. No coffee maker but there is a Starbucks downstairs.
Solid 3 stars,.   New York , I Love You. But you're bringing me down. Like a rat in a cage. Pulling minimum wage. New York, you're perfect. Don't please don't change a thing. Your mild billionaire mayor's. Now convinced he's a king. New York, I Love You. But you're freaking me out. New York, I Love You. But you're bringing me down. . .   $5 black jack
There was some  hesitation in voting the 4th star here, but like many other things, it wasn't as average as a 3, and not as great as a 4.  And since Yelp refuses to give us use of a 1/2 star, I am forced to round, and as this was a very enjoyable 3.5 star experience, it goes up to 4.. . We booked a room here for the Rock n Roll Marathon and Half Marathon weekend.  It wasn't our first choice, but we waited way too long to book the room, and by the time we pulled the trigger, it was either here or the MGM, which is where we stayed the last time.  I like the MGM, but we decided that we could save a lot of money here, and it would be some place new, so worth taking the risk.. . Neither of us had high expectations.  We looked at it like a Quality Inn or some similar quality hotel, just bigger (Vegas style).  We were wrong. Firstly, I booked the room using 2 methods.  3 of our nights were booked using myvegas comps from facebook.  Been playing those freaking games for a year, and it paid off.  Got 3 rooms for free, except for taxes and resort fees.  The 4th night I booked through the race website and got probably 30-40% off.  Unfortunately, because I wanted to use my freebies on the most expensive nights, it ended up being 3 reservations (thurs/Fri, Sat, and then Sun).  I heard stories that the hotel would make you check out and check back in each day, and possibly switch rooms.  However, that was not our experience.  The booking agents through myvegas and the race were able to link the reservations so that when we showed up to check in, the front desk clerk basically merged them all and we never even had to go back down to re-check in each day.  In fact, the only hiccup was the information housekeeping received apparently showed the checkout on Saturday, but they knocked and then left when I explained they were mistaken.  No harm done.. . So - customer service was fantastic.  As for the rooms - really comfortable.  Beds were easy to sleep in, linens were soft.  Rooms weren't huge, but spacious enough (we were in a "Park Avenue King," basically their smaller room (400 sq. ft +/-)).  Large bathrooms with awesome showers (hot and strong water pressure).  My only complaint about the room is that we were over the roller coaster and could hear it and people screaming whenever it was running.  Not very loud, and it didn't keep me awake for long, but you could hear it in the background.  Tip for you would be to ask if your room is over the coaster, and if so, try to get a higher floor so maybe it will be more muted (we were on the 17th).  And wifi was free (well, it was included in your resort fee, but some places don't give you wifi with your resort fee).. . The rest of the hotel was fine.  The casino isn't huge, but I found tables to play at easily enough with room.  As this is NY NY and not Wynn or Bellagio, they had plenty of $10 limit and other low limit tables.  It was fairly easy to get in and out of the hotel (i.e., unlike MGM, you didn't have to walk for 20 minutes just to get to the front door).  Our check in and check out was very quick and smooth, but we arrived at 8:00 PM and left at 8:00 AM, so timing might have had something to do with that.  The sportsbook looked comfortable, but I didn't spend any time in there (plenty of screens and TVs, like you would expect).. . I only ate at the Broadway Burger Bar and reviewed that separately.  We otherwise didn't spend any time in the hotel.  I did use their coffee stand for some coffee and tea (not starbucks, thank god, but that may have been somewhere else in the hotel).  Both the coffee and tea were very good.  Trying to remember what brand tea they served, and I can't, but I do remember it being high quality.  . . The only other thing to comment on is that this simply looked like a fun hotel.  Every night down on the casino floor were people cheering and laughing and having fun.  There is a bar by the room elevators that does dueling pianos, and it was constantly packed with people singing along.  Only draw back is I heard they charged an obnoxious cover for a lobby bar - even with entertainment.  . . I'd stay here again.  I'll probably want to try someplace new for my next trip, but I will definitely keep NY NY in mind as a fallback.
New York - New York was: Stinky, Crowded, Loud, Overpriced and Dirty/Rundown.. . Still it was a decent experience but we won't be back because of the above.. . Some Redeeming qualities:. The Hotel Staff - Hard workers that labor in the above environment.. Location - Good part of the strip. The Roller-Coaster and Coney Island are neat additions that my kids enjoyed.  . . MGM should spend some money and renovate NY NY and not just use it as a cash cow.
This has been one of the south-strip staple locations to see for years. The main attraction here is actually the roller coaster and the game room for kids. . . The casino floor itself is not huge but its not too small - it does have some modern touches after a recent renovation about 2 years ago and they are currently working on redoing something near the entrance that is near the sports book (I was here the weekend of Nov. 21-23 2014) The casino can be a bit hard to figure out as it can circle you around a bit. The upstairs attraction is the Coyote Ugly bar which can get crowded quickly and seems to turn into a mess of young people - not exactly one of the more better established bar/clubs that are on the vegas strip but it has been a staple to the New York New York for about 10 years or so.. . I have never had much luck in the casino here - not sure if its what I was playing but I have seen winners come out of this place so it may be a place to try if you feel like bank rolling some of the table games. A nice touch here is the lack of smoke in the casino itself compared to some of the others in the area. . . Give this place a walk through the next timeyou are in.
