A solid place for all types of kushikatsu/kushiage izakaya type dishes. Complete with a menu of deep fried squid legs to cold soba, it's a no brainer for a casual dinner with friends.. . Some things were under seasoned like the calamari and fried baby octopus but overall everything was pretty good. The salmon carpaccio is delicious and bright, fresh tasting. The buttered mushrooms were CRAZY salty so I couldn't actually finish that. Cold soba with mountain yam was really yummy. . . I think some of the best items on the menu are actually the items scribbled in Japanese on the walls.
Mehhhh. Don't know what the hype is about this place. We ordered a bunch of different dishes included the yellowtail tar tar, tofu salad, miso cod. The yellowtail was mixed with a salsa and put on top of chips with too much rice. It tasted fishy. The only good dish for me was the cod. The menu items placed on the walls makes ordering very hard and confusing. I want to give it one more try since the other reviews are good but I just didn't have the same experience.
DIRTY and RUDE.. . They were closed by the Regulator due to health violation not long ago. They reopened, so I bought a gift certificate through my company's perk to give it a try. Thank god I presented my gift cert before I order my food, the manager said it expired and won't honor it, and rudely walked away. I pointed out that the big fine print states "do not expire". Then he changed his word saying that MY company made a mistake, I should contact my company or the vendor to get my refund, his restaurant made no mistake. No apologizes. I felt like he frauded me. . . (When I talk, I tend to give hand gestures. While writing this review, I just realized that he "tabbed" my hands a couple times to shut me up while I was talking. very rude.)
Hands down, my favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas. Very authentic food as well as some modern twists. Beef Tataki, tongue, wasabi octopus, oh and the bacon wrapped mochi. Small location so generally there are wait times, but so worth it. Late night hours is also a huge plus. Every chance I get I try to come here when I'm in town. Go here! Trust the fat kid
Ramen DX was salty; skewers were ok but nothing blew me away. We ordered grilled whole squid which was totally forgotten so we ended up canceling it...
Very good food and services! Will defintely come back again if I am in the area!
