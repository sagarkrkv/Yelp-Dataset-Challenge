One of the best meals of my life. Gumbo,  Filet, oliver style was delectable.  A nice 2010 bottle of wine from emerils own collection.  White choco macadamia nut  bread pudding.. . Oh and the twice baked potato was like silk!. . Service was great too, very attentive.
i ate here on 10-27-14 around 5:30 pm.  i enjoyed my dining experience in the bar.  the hostess staff was very friendly.  the bar staff did a great job too.  they took the time to go over the menu and to have some small talk.  made the dining experience more enjoyable.. . for dinner i ordered the bone in ribeye.  i really enjoyed this steak more than "the cut" which was in the palazzo.  my delmonico ribeye had more flavor and juices!  i enjoyed my free bread basket too.  the side of smashed potatoes were great!  i went with the bar servers recommendation of trying the banana cream pie.  not my cup of tea but i enjoyed my pie.. . i enjoyed my steak, the staff and overall had a great time.  my bill before tip was $86.  i would definitely go back again!
I'm still dreaming about this meal. We don't often spend this kind of money on a dinner out, but this was a special night out in Vegas, so why not? Let me tell you, it was worth every penny. . . Top items include:. Delmonico cocktail. It was heaven, but I love gin and grapefruit and it was a perfect mix. . . The truffle chips. Oh my goodness they were so good. . . The steak my husband ordered melted in your mouth. It was perfectly cooked to order and had fantastic taste. . . I ordered seared scallops, a special. Totally amazing. . . We went with our servers recommendation on dessert, the flourless chocolate torte. I'm still pining over it. . . Above all, the service was phenomenal. We had a table of 8 and we always had an attentive server ready to answer any questions, provide recommendations that were always spot on, or even help us find a lost card. . . Great spot!
Dinner with my wife and 6 family members...no problem with reservations for this large part of a party.  Service was outstanding!  We all agreed that the steaks were some of the best we had ever eaten!  Seafood tower was very good!  Sides were very tasty and the creamed corn was SO GOOD!  Not sure how they prepared it, but it was some of the best ever.  Will definitely include this restaurant in our future visits to Las Vegas!
This is my second visit to one of emeril's steakhouses. Like the chophouse I visited previously, the service and food were out of this world. It's not a cheap eat, but it's one of the best steaks you'll ever have!
I had dinner here couple weeks ago with all my team members from work, party of 7. Everything that we ordered was great and it's like you can't go wrong with all the dishes.
I really enjoyed the medium-rare rib eye as it was seasoned and cooked to perfection, but what I enjoyed even more were the pork chops!  Bone in tender chops cooked barely pink covered in a delicious, light sauce.  I'm getting moist just thinking about it.
Had an outstanding dinner last week. It was over the top. The dry aged prime grade bone in new york was the best. try the banana cream pie. will be hard to eat out after that service.
After three years of waiting, I finally found myself back to Delmonico Steakhouse. Why did I come here out of all the other excellent steak houses on the Las Vegas strip?. . 1 reason: Truffle Parmesan potato chips. they are like crack, you simply can't stop eating them :). . I ordered the Certified Piedmontese steak, NY Strip steak ($60), grilled in olive oil, sea salt, roasted garlic and rosemary. At 16 ounces, each tender bite was worth every dollar.. . Girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup and said it was very good.. . Service is impeccable with a three person staff dedicated to your table and they make your experience worth the high price tag that is at Delmoncio!
If it was not for the price I probably would consider giving it three stars... 1) wine here is overpriced ALOT 2) we ordered bone-in rib eye as median but got almost well-done 3) lamb was tasteless 4) service was mediocre. Overall I had a really hard time giving more than 2 stars for a restaurant that's supposed to be such high-end but has no idea how to cook steak median...
I want to give this place 2 stars,but because of the excellent service I'll bump it up to 3. The best thing about this place was the impeccable service received.  I dined here with my husband on a late Friday night.  The food here was just "OK". My breakdown of each dish is this:. . The Popovers: meh..they were ok. I think they were over cooked which made them a bit too dry and with a slightly burnt butter taste. I like Tyler Florence does a better version at Wayfare Tavern (SF).. . Appetizer special - Pappardelle w/ Crimini Mushrooms in a white wine sauce finished with parmigiana: Good stuff. Very light and tasty pasta, too many mushrooms for my liking, I would've preferred more pasta. Very small tasting plate so don't expect to get more than 3 or 4 bites.. . Creamed spinach: Another meh dish. I wanted more flavor here. Maybe a finish with butter would've helped. Some seasoning or something. Literally all I could taste was watery spinach.. . Twice Baled loaded Potatoes: YESSSSSS PLEASE! Now this was a great dish. Flavor in every bite. Perfect partner for my steak.. . Ribeye Steak (w/o bone) OSCAR STYLE w/ Jumbo Lump Crab Meat, Grilled Asparagus and Bearnaise.- I SOOOOOO wanted to love this steak. I really did. Order a my steak cooked medium and unfortunately it came out damn near rare. Like literally just short of bleeding. There was hardly any flavor.  The best part was the burnt edges as they actually added some flavor. I'd give my steak a 2/5, however, the Jumbo Lump crab and Bearnaise WAS THE BOMB!. . Smoked Pork chop: my husband truly enjoyed his pork chop. Tender with a smokey flavor all the way thru. The pork chop was huge! I'm not a big pork chop eater, but it was tasty. . . Pecan pie: Now this was worth the price of admission. A tasty warm & nutty pie with cold delicious ice cream. Mmmmm mmmmm good. I'd come here again just to eat this. A MUST have if you're ordering desserts.. . As previously mentioned in other reviews, the wine here is definitely over priced. I understand the mark ups restaurants need to make, but I think Delmonico's takes the "upcharge" to an entirely new level. We ordered a bottle of Kim Crawford's Sauvignon Blanc, which retails for about $18-20, we were charged $45 for the bottle!!! Talk about a rip off! outside of opening the bottle ms pouring the wine, what constitutes a $25 mark up?. . Needless to say I most likely won't return here. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think it was worth the price tag. I'd prefer to go back to Mario Batali's B&B, which is located directly across the walk way from Delmonico's.
