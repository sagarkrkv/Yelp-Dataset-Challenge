This was a neat and unique upscale blend of a restaurant with an identity crisis. This crisis however led to a nice fusion of Mexican and Chinese cuisine. A quaint and cozy setting inside the cosmopolitan hotel and located on their second floor China Poblano has delicious food with my vegetable fried brown rice with chicken having an amazing combination of Mexican and Chinese flavor. The prices are very reasonable for Las Vegas. Neither the restaurant, the setting, or the food blew my mind, but I would eat here again. The service was good and the ambience was enjoyable.
DO NOT waste your money and time!!  This is the most disgusting place in Las Vegas we have ever been to!!  Expensive and VERY small portions...overly salty..everything is drowned with soy sauce...you see I am Chinese and I know what REAL dim sum and chinese cusine should taste like and its certainly NOT THIS!!!  We spent $50 on 3 dishes plus one taco and we left still hungry..this place should NOT be in business!!!  GROSS!!!
We stopped in because they were open late and a friend said it was really good. It was good but as many others have said the price is a little steep. For some things there is a reasonable price and for some things not at all. We snacked on the lotus chips and they were great. We got the lamb gouza which sounded good but didn't blow us away. I liked it more than my BF did. The duck fluatas on the special menu sounded interesting and the mole was good but the duck was dry and lacked that fatty rich duck flavor. It was a disappointment. The BF said both of his tacos were pretty good. The stand out was the shu mai sampler. They were REALLY delicious. It was around 65 dollars before tip for two tacos, lotus chips, gouza, shu mai and fluatas and no drinks. Honestly we could eat a lot of really delicious things in Las Vegas for less and I am a person who would happily pay more for food it it delivered in both quality and taste. You could tell the quality was there, the taste was inconsistent across our dishes and that leaves me feeling like there was not a value to our meal. . . With so many places to try in Las Vegas I don't know if I would return but maybe for a snack of chips and shu mai because they really were special.
Awesome GF vegetarian options: ensalada remolacha, asparagus with sesame seeds, and mushroom tacos. . . Friendly staff, efficient service, and spunky atmosphere.
Our waiter informed us that this restaurant was more collaboration than fusion. At first this was confusing but after many small, delicious plates emerged from the kitchen, I understood. I love Chinese and Mexican food and this place brought out some great flavors from both nations. Pot stickers, dumplings, an awesome fried rice dish and a very tender Mongolian beef were complimented by tacos, guacamole..you get the idea. The hostesses graciously seated us right away on a packed night and the view from the casino/patio was outstanding. Not outrageously expensive either like most casino restaurants so overall a great choice in the Cosmo.
Amazing taste combinations - perfect marriage of exquisite handmade bbq pork buns (try the Golden Pig with a drizzle of condensed milk) and the savory Barbacoa de Res taco.  The Eastern Gin and Tonic was interesting but weak for $18 charge.  My margarita was good but also overpriced.  Compared to other dining in Cosmopolitan, this place was reasonably priced but still outrageous. If you are looking for less taste but better deals, try Holsteins next door (2nd floor)
Once again Jose Andres has made his impression on another sexy casual dinning.... Everything I ordered was as expected complex yet simply delicious.the only downside is the menu is difficult to read however the server was very attentive and helped out tremendously. Good stuff!
If I was rating on taste alone, the food is flavorful and is well balanced and has good contrast in textures and deserves the four stars. I enjoyed the pork belly taco as well as the carnitas taco. The noodle dishes are flavorful as well. The handmade noodles have just the right chew. I do have to warn you that if you are hungry, this is probably not the right place for you unless you are prepared to spend a little extra casino winnings. If you are hungry , the torta is the way to go, but it doesn't quite have the same complexities of flavor as the other dishes. If I were to rate based on value, probably closer to 2.5 stars.
EXPENSIVE !!!. Expect to be paying about $5.50-$10 for ONE TACO.. . I mean don't get me wrong, the tacos are pretty good, but DAMMM its expensive for such a small portion. They don't even use special taco shells, its just regular tortilla tacos.. . Viva China Taco. (beef tendon/kumamoto oysters) $5.50. . This taco was really unique. The beef tendon was dried and had the texture of really thin beef jerky. It was glazed in an asian flavor sauce. Served with ONE semi-raw oyster and seaweed. It was different but good.. . Carnitas Taco $5.50. (braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda). . This taco was basically filled with pulled pork. Topped with a spicy salsa that resembled spicy guacamole with chopped onions. Then two small pieces of pork rinds. It was good as well.. . 18 Monk Noodle $14.88. (hand cut wheat noodles, shiitake, crispy sweet potato, soy sauce). . Honestly, these noodles were kind of disgusting. First of all, it was a really tiny portion served in a large bowl. The noodles were completely over-sauced and drenched in soy sauce which made it salty. It was definitely not worth the price tag and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!. . Overall, we bought one bowl of noodles, and three tacos, and the bill came out to about $50. Not coming back here again.
I came here during my friends bachelorette party not knowing it was a Jose Andres restaurant.  I wanted something to eat before heading into the club, and this place was way overpriced, lacked quality? And portions are teeny.  On top of that I had to wait about 30 minutes for a super small taco, and the taco was just okay.
