What's interesting about reviewing an Airport -  is a) you don't really have options and b) It's sometimes hard to separate airline experience vs. airport experience since they work hand in hand. . . The Airport has some neat art work near the ticket counters. I wish I could spend time admiring it, but even if you're several hours early, you can never "relax" until you've made it all the way through security. I'd encourage them to move the art pieces to the terminal so people waiting for flights, post-security can enjoy them. . . TSA and Security is what it is... they haven't caught any Terrorists yet, but I'll be darned, if I don't have to produce 16 different notarized documents to bring my insulin on the plane with me. I wish we didn't have to take off our shoes, because it encourages poor footwear choice, especially if you arrive somewhere where you have to walk pretty far to get to your connection and/or front door. . . Once you're in the terminal, I have to hand it to Sky Harbor. They restaurant selection is robust. Everything from burgers, coffee and Mexican Food, to McDonalds, and NYPD pizza. Yes, everything is a little more expensive, but you don't have a choice, and you will pay for it. . . The staff is mostly pleasant, and helpful. I wish the bathrooms had more places to hang things and/or a shelf to store your rolling suitcase while you went potty - but that's a pipe dream. . . To quote another reviewer "Planes come in. Planes go out." and they entertain you in the meantime.
Terminal 4 is the BOMB. It's surprising to me since I travel worldwide often, how more airports are not getting on the program with highlighting their local establishments but... Sky Harbor definitely does! Love that Matt's Big Breakfast, Cartel Coffee, Lola's, LGO and others are all available while you wait for your flight.. . Come on LAX get with it already, Phoenix has got you SO beat when it comes to airport amenities!
This Airport was awesome to fly into and very easy to fly out of!  I didn't even have to take off my shoes!  Seriously, but I probably looked like I had drugs on me at 7 in the morning so the drug sniffing Dog had to sniff me up!  But it was probably just the records I was holding that I purchased on vacation that gave the dog a whiff of his life!  . Lots of rest rooms all very clean, good choices for eats, and lots of Starbucks!  Cant complain!  Only bummer is the Rental Car local is about 10 miles away from the airport and you have to hop on a bus to get there! But the busses came frequently and were safe and cozy!
Not a great airport. It is chronically crowded and doesn't manage this well. I try to avoid this airport when possible.
Big airport.  Reasonably efficient for its size.  Way better than O'Hare for general amenities
Old and needs serious remodeling!
Best airport, excellent variety of places to eat. Only bad thing about this airport is picking up/ drop off. Very confusing
I like. The only suggestion would be is for a play area for kids in case you have to wait over 2 hours for your flight.  But then again, it might be hard to tear the kids away if it's too good.  Good variety of food and good signage.  I always see helpful airport personnel.  The only downside of a big airport is missing a sign that gets you to the right terminal or the north or south side.  Especially at night, it would be better to repeat signs. I always dread picking up up at night.
Having flown in here on numerous occasions, I will say it is a nice airport.  It is big and sprawling, but there are some very nice food and shopping options, and I have normally encountered courteous staff.  On my most recent trip, I received a good dining recommendation, and helpful staff pointing me to a TSA check in that had short lines, but was still close to my gate.  The Rental Car hub does require a shuttle bus, but they have them running continuously, so I have never had to wait more than a couple minutes before jumping on, either heading to, or coming from the Rental Car places.  Overall it is usually very busy, but as far as airports go, not a bad spot for a layover.
Was just passing through. It is a major airport and with that it has major crowds. Like other airports I've visited; The staff is usually curtious and helpful whereas the passengers seem more rude and aggressive. There is plenty of shopping and eating available near the gates. Ok place.
Nice airport in a beautiful city.  Terminal 4 for US Airways had good amenities, easy access to airport shuttle to rental car hub that run frequently. Friendly TSA staffers moved big lines along quickly, even the drug sniffing dog at security was nice!  . . But seriously, having choices like Starbucks, Peet's Coffee and Four Peak Brewery at the airport for food and drink beats the choices at our airports in NJ!
I was just passing through on a connection.  Its a big airport with lots of different options.  Somewhat chaotic, but that is airline travel these days.. . There were many different food options, all of which looked pretty good.  Only had time to grab something quick (auntie annies, i recall), but was happy they had good variety.  Gate areas can be a bit cramped.
I travel quite often, always with the same airline so I have my routine pretty much down. I can see why a first timer would be confused or have a poor experience here the airport is HUGE. Be prepared to WALK especially if you are flying in. . . Tons of places to eat even if you are not actually flying somewhere so whomever is dropping you off can park and go have a bite to eat with you. . . If you're getting a rental good luck you have to take a shuttle to get to the rental port and it's usually busy so be prepared to wait a bit. . . If you're flying in each and every time the bags take FOREVER to get the baggage claim port on average it's about a 10 minute wait BEFORE they announce that your bags are being loaded to whatever baggage claim port.. So once again be prepared to wait. Oh not to mention this is after about a 10 minute journey to the baggage claim area after you get off your flight.
Great in and out!  I have been to a few airports but this is well set up.
I travel a lot and this is a great airport.  Wifi, great food choices and a USO.  All my faves.  I traveling in on a Friday and out on a Sunday with ease.  Even the lines at TSA moved quickly.
This airport has a nice amount of amenities to keep you entertained on a long layover. We enjoy going to the brewery to eat and have some beers :-) I like that the gates are easy to find and lots of moving walkways for the tired folks.  Overall a clean airport and our flights have always left on time in our experience.
Nice, clean and modern airport... The layout from terminal to terminal isnt too massive but you will walk a little ways. At least I did when I flew in from Burbank on Southwest. Met some folks leaving Bob Hope that werekind enough to tell me that I should look for the South door where it will take me right to curbside pickup where my friends where. I was grateful because I probably would have been walking around aimlessly otherwise. There are plenty of people movers if you dont want to trek it from terminal to terminal. There are a lot of eateries upstairs on the 2nd level. And just like other Yelpers mentioned, they have some popular local fare. . . One thing I noticed that could be improved when I was departing (Southwest) was that there were about 4 gates crammed into one end of the terminal. I was at A8 and there was just a log jam of folks waiting to depart, looking for seats and everything else in between. It was cramped to say the least.. . But overall I liked flying in to Sky Harbor. The approach takes you right over Sun Devil stadium and I found myself looking directly inside at the field. TSA was super-friendly. I appreciated the TSA pre-check status so it was an expedited trip through that spared me taking off my shoes & hoodie. I'm sure I'll be flying in sooner than later once again.... I gotta get some chicken & waffles at Lo-Lo's... And a sweet tea next time for sure.
It's a big airport...but it's also an easy to navigate airport. You won't starve with the food selections, coffee is everywhere and it's fairly clean. I fly in and out of PHX a few times a year and I have never really had any issues. Just be careful existing because one wrong turn and you can wind up on the opposite end of Phoenix and it's a hassle to get back on track.
I have lived in Phx the last 16 years and find the recent improvements to Sky Harbor to be a great asset.  I look forward to using the tram on my next trip.
OK, so this was interesting.. . This is a giant complex of buildings and transportation devices. Large flying machines land on specially built paths, and then pull up to the building and disgorge their contents.  Then they have more contents loaded into them, and then they pull out on to the pathways and fly away. . . And get this. The contents are PEOPLE. People just like you and me. . . Before you get on the plane other nice people with blue hands caress you and make sure you still have your car keys and that your laptop works. You can walk to the Engorgement Funnel from there, or you can stand still on a moving conveyor belt, which still isn't fast enough for some people because they walk on it. It's disconcerting. . . There are all sorts of things to see and buy. Everything is expensive, probably because it was brought in on one of the flying machines.. . When you get outside the building, there are other machines to take you to a special place to rent a smaller machine, where they will attempt to sell you hundreds of dollars of insurance that you don't need, right, Dollar Rent a Car, you bastards?. . Anyway, it's a miraculous conglomeration of machines, rolling, flying, and sweeping their human cargo every which way.
Maybe it is just me, but this is not my favorite airport.  Yes, the views from the many glass surrounded moving sidewalks and trams are AMAZING.  However, I know what I need from an airport - I need easy access to other partsof the airports, I need several restaurants where I can sit and be served while I catch up on life that I might have missed during air travel, lots of plug-ins and I would love a nail salon (in case I am delayed).  That makes this airport...Tricky. . First off there are 4 terminals that I am aware of and its not even easy to move gates within the terminals.  It makes a huge airport feel a little smaller, but it makes dining and pick up or drop off much harder.  Last, but most certainly not least - most plug ins are hidden at gates in the floor and if there is a rhyme or reason as to where they are.... you need a de-coder to figure it out.  . The only food in the particular gate that I seem to always get is a complex of a salad, sandwich, burger, pizza spot where you stand in line to order.  BOO!  (Terminal 4 - A gates) . The upside is security is always nice and has been short many more times than not!  Just don't get there early and be sure your ride arrives on time.  In that case, you will be A-Ok!  . People are friendly, views are beautiful, but if I get a choice of connections, this isn't a winner for me!
What a piece of crap air port!!!  It's near midnight and we have a 1:30 am flight to miami, I know .... bummer. Anyway, we need to get to the B gates but the B gate security gates are closed. No problem, walk 20 minutes back through the A gates and loop back around.  Restaurants or open bars?  Nope not one.  There was 1 vending machine that couldn't or wouldn't take a credit card.  So much for a bottle of water.  This place SUCKS!!!!!
We had a red eye coming back and terminal C had nothing opened (we got there at 8PM) , but one small bar. one vending machine that just had drinks, no snacks. I've had better but expected a bit more from Phoenix.
Only been to a handful or airports and this one is as good as any that I've seen.
Horrible Airport Like It Smell Like Throw Up Not Nice pple are Rude Not Clean Restrooms Just a Sad Place Never Flying there Again
This airport was fine to have a layover in. Super crowded but that's what you can expect given the holiday and all. I guess I found it a little off putting that you had to travel the whole length of the terminal for a cup of joe and a pastry. Kind of inconvenient.
Its a pretty good airport. Its centrally located, clean, well designed terminals with floor-to-ceiling windows with mountain views, and virtually endless places that will fly in and out of there. Its like any airport though. During peak times it sucks... lines, hassles, lots of older folks slowing things down. Just very hectic. And during off-peak hours (if you miss a night flight), its the opposite... total boredom. Nothing is open, no good sleeping spots, endless automated chatter over the intercom asking someone to pick up a "white paging phone", etc. You cant win. Unless you have your own plane or a magic carpet.
No complaints here ! Like every other airport security is always a hassle, but the TSA agents are friendly. There is a nice selection of food and things to look at while you're waiting in the terminal , well at least near the southwest gates. In my opinion it's one of the better airports.
I love this airport. It has all the food, entertainment, and outlets you could want.. . When I go to an airport I need three things:  good food, free wifi, and lots of places to charge all of my electronics.  Sky Harbor has all of these things.  They have a Humble Pie in Terminal C, a Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, an Olive and Ivy, a Sauce, a Zinc! So many good places to eat! Not to mention the standbys like Wendy's Sbarros, Paradise Bakery, etc.. . All of the terminals have outlet stations next to the seats as well as the conventional outlets in the walls.  At a lot of airports i have to sit on the floor or next to a trashcan or do something else equally awkward to charge my computer, but at Sky Harbor I can be a civilized human while I recharge.. . The airport security guards are sticklers for idling in the waiting areas for too long, but it also helps the pick up-drop off situation avoid being the disaster that you see at other airports, ~cough~ LAX.
Its an airport....
