One of the nicest hotels I have seen in Vegas! All beautifully and exquisitely decorated. Theme is floral. First thing you notice when you come in are the huge red chandeliers right in the middle of the check in area. Amazing!!!. . The main reason why I booked this hotel is because you get more for your money in the sense that the rooms are huge! Black and beige are the dominant colors in the room decoration. . . I love that you can turn the lights on and off with a click of a button. As well as closing the curtains and putting the privacy in your room. Great convenience.  And the best part, it's right next to your bed. So you don't have to hit your toes with everything around you trying to get to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The beds are oh so comfy!!! But the robes......OMG!!!!!! I need one in my life! The bathrooms are pretty much the size of a regular room in any other hotel.. . Now, the reason as to why I gave this hotel 4 stars and not 5.. Upon arrival, we were told that the hotel holds $150 a NIGHT, we stayed 4 nights so that's $600. So go ready for that! This was our second time in Vegas and this is the first time I have ever heard of a hotel holding so much per night. Oh, aside from paying resort fees. Another reason why I gave it 4 stars, the pool area isn't as nice as other hotels. I prefer the one at the wynn, which is just a few steps away. And a plus is that if you stay at the encore, you can visit the pool at the wynn as much as you like! The casinos at the encore are super nice, but the Wynn casinos looked a little outdated to me. . . The downside of staying at the south of the strip is that you have to do some major foot work to get to the good stuff on the strip. Bellagio fountains, Paris Eiffel Tower, etc. so be prepared to waste more on taxis than usual. Unless you rent a car. Which in my opinion isn't worth it if you're visiting the strip. Too much traffic. . . Last but not least, the restaurants in this hotel are extremely expensive! Even breakfast. It's over priced. We all know vegas is overpriced, but this hotel takes the cake! Now, the food at the restaurants was great Dont get me wrong, but definitely way too overpriced. . . Would I stay here again? Maybe not. Service was great, hotel was beautiful. But it's too far from the center of the strip and not at a cheap cost!
Haven't stayed at this hotel. This review is just for the front desk, Richard. So helpful! We were partying at Surrender this past Halloween weekend and was looking for our friend. He actually let us use the front desk phone to contact our hotel (Aria) and contact our cell phones (to reach our friend who had all of our stuff) AND even gave us some water bottles. I told him I'd leave a review on yelp for him for the great service he provided us, even despite the fact that we weren't guests there. Unfortunately he's unfamiliar with it lol. So I hope management sees this and recognizes Richard for his kindness and quality service. Thanks!
Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #276 - #365. . Steve Wynn nails it again with Encore!. . I was excited to hear we would be staying at Encore for two nights paid for by my cousin. Heh It still lives up to it's 5 star elegance and is better than Bellagio in my opinion. But really, you can't compare Bellagio and Encore because they are two different resorts with different themes. Encore was chosen mainly because it is set far away from the rowdiness that is "Sin City" and into it's own niche in the northern part of the strip. The Encore is an all suite tower with an option to upgrade to the larger suites or with the panoramic view. Luckily for us we were upgraded to the panoramic view on the 56th floor for free because we my cousin knew one of the front desk clerks. . . As you can tell through the details of the well appointed casino like the colorful butterflies on the mosaic floor and on the ceiling, his idea for the Encore/Wynn theme was "Natural Beauty." It shows throughout the complex the big expensive windows overlooking the gardens and the warm colorful tones of the property and the many waterfalls outside of the property make you feel secluded from the rest of the strip. Aside from the hotel / casino, the clientele is very attractive and healthy compared to the ones who patron the low end hotels. . . Staff here are top notch and live up to the Wynn standard of service. I didn't get to try the pool because we were always in and out of the hotel. You are allowed to use the Wynn pool which is just a 5 minute walk from Encore. Outside of the complex, I wouldn't walk north at night because the neighborhood is shady and a lot of panhandlers and sketchy people populate north of Encore. If you're looking to save some money from Encore's fancy restaurants, there is a Denny's just outside of Encore and a food court in the Fashion Show Mall right across the street.   . . The casino is not as smokey as the other casinos with it's strong ventilation systems and fancy scent they pump into the air system. I will admit I did win some money playing at Wynn because the slots at Encore are tight. They always send great deals when you gamble a few $$$ in their casino. Encore has swoon me over and I will definitely come back if I receive a good deal. Kudos to Encore!
If I could leave 0 stars I would like that option . I love the hotel I go to Vegas quite often and encore is always my top pick for a stay. Unfortunately, I had my first bad experience due to the security . My friend and I used the bathroom then we were going to proceed to xs. But a head security manager made a call to stop my. Friend and I for no reason whatsoever. There were 2 of them one I believe  was Robert and Jeff. They approached us asking for our IDS for no reason and didn't ask us why we there . We showed no signs of any illegal activity nor did we look the part . Jeff held our IDS and continued to bend them and they were  spelling our names to their manager . This took about a good. 10-15 mins . People began to notice and started calling us names due to the public humiliation . We spoke to lee who was the manager at the time and he basically showed no  remorse and said 2 comments " we wanna weed them out " and " do you want me to sugar coat it for you guys " . If this is the type of people you hire it can lead to a serious problem .  Due to what occurred outside the club we still proceeded to go to xs yet to find to our surprise men were harassing us inside the club thinking we were escorts . It was the worst feeling a woman can ever have and this needs to be resolved . I will take this further .
This review is way overdue but now that I was looking to book our next trip and came across Encore it reminded me of the bad memories they left us with.. . The hotel is nice and very clean and that's why it was very hard for me to give less than 3 stars but my lower review is based on this that I lost my expensive perfume in the room and they showed no responsibility to fix the situations. I left my small bag with that perfume in the room and as soon as we left I realized I am missing it so I called them and after checking they said they did not found anything which was impossible. . . They asked me to send them an email when I return so they can follow up but unfortunately they did not even bother to reply to any of my emails. I wish they took matters like this that probably are very small to them more serious, because just that will make us never want to stay with them.
It depends on why you're in Las Vegas.  If you're here to gamble and want to hop casino to casino, you'll want to stay more toward the center of the strip.  If you're here for a bachelor party and want to be in the center of all of the craziness, maybe you'll appreciate the Cosmopolitan more than I do.  If you're shopping for the best steal of a bargain rate, you won't find it here.  . . If you're coming as a couple though, and you want to stay at a great hotel, eat at great places, relax at the pool, and do a little gambling a little farther away from the crowds, Encore is still my favorite place to stay on the Strip.  . . I think they have the best standard rooms as well.  They're upscale, modern, elegant, and sleek.
All I can say is I am glad I wasn't paying the bill for this one.  The rooms are very very nice and everything is elegant to the max, and the price of everything reflects that.  I actually spent time in the room because I loved the view and the furnishings.  Usually, they just want you to hustle on down to the casino and gamble.  I was somewhat taken aback by the warning on the food/mini bar stuff.  I know that you should pay for it if you use it, but the words were a bit.....harsh (in my estimation).  I really did not want to eat 10 cashews for $11 nor did I even want to open the "intimacy kit" that was perched off to the side.  Intimacy kit?  Everything was sitting on little alarm pads just waiting for someone to make a mistake and look at the stuff for longer than 60 seconds.  I was so put off by the snacks (and a hangover kit too) that I didn't even open the mini bar.  Dang!
I have been to Vegas many, many times. Everytime I go I like to stay at a hotel I have not stayed before, Encore it was your turn! Halloween night we were going to XS, so Encore was the perfect place to stay, wrong! The hotel itself is amazing, beautiful...the rooms are spacious! You think since you are staying at such a nice hotel WiFi would be included right, wrong again! You will be charged $16.99 a day for WiFi. It amazed me that I paid so much to stay there and yet they want to charge me for WiFi. I got over that quick!  If you like to gamble Encore is not the place. The casino floor is very small...you will need to walk over to the Wynn if you want any kind of gaming. I was expecting housekeeping to at least make our beds while we were out, wrong yet again! Not once did housekeeping knock on our door to see if we needed anything, I had to go looking for additional towels. I would give this rating a 2 1/2 only because the hotel is beautiful, but cannot give 3. I would recommend visiting Encore to check it out, but not to stay in.
Stayed 3 nights for a conference and all I can say is wow! The place had amazing trendy details and the rooms were quite the display overlooking the vegas strip. We went to the waterfall, the beach club, the rose garden, and there was shopping a crossed the street. We were super impressed with the hotel staff and the 5 star service that was provided. It was defiantly a great experience and we will be back.
Stayed at the Encore Tower Suites. I was treated like a VIP. They had private check in, private valet. Everyone was really nice, I had room service, and the food was terrific, and fast service. I will stay here again.
Excellent hotel.  Got a panoramic suite with a small bedroom with queen bed. Separate large living room with great view of strip.. . More private than Wynn tower.  Encore European pool is really nice with a cool bar right on the pool deck.  Lots of spots in the shade at this pool.... Main Wynn pool is huge and a realy cool design, so check that one out, too.. . We think it's better than Bellagio or Venetian/  palazzo, because it is more private without huge crowds of tourists walking the strip.
Everything about this hotel is so beautiful. We got a comp room for 2 nights on the 24th floor and loved almost every moment of it.. The reason I say almost is because with all the elegance and glam, there was this really weird/disgusting sour smell in the bathroom. We thought it was going to go away but it never did and it only got worse after someone would shower. We considered moving rooms but 2 nights went by so fast and didn't want to waste time repacking everything.. . . Anywho, past the stench, it was a glamorous experience. The bed made me feel like I was sleeping on a cloud. The remote control lights and drapes were badass. The color scheme and decor were so beautiful.. I definitely felt like a queen for a weekend. It was awesome and I would definitely stay here again.
I enjoy Encore. It's almost prettier than the Wynn. It's got lots of red and butterflies. I feel rich just walking through it. And there are some great restaurants. It's never as crowded as the Wynn and other uppity properties. The cocktails at the various bars are wonderful. The pool is awesome. Parking is a breeze. But alas, it is still too rich for my wallet. Gaming here is not exactly an option unless you can drop like $100 a hand. But nonetheless, very pretty to walk through.
This is the perfect hotel for a romantic getaway.  Ok, so I was there by myself on a business trip to attend a convention.  BUT then next time I'm in Las Vegas for fun, I'm coming back here.  There was a control next to the bed that opened and closed the drapes - nice.  I felt like I was in a movie.  The bathroom was amazing.  There was a TV in the bathroom which I normally would have thought to be a silly luxury and now I want to install one in my bath.  It's so nice to take a hot bath and watch TV.  And the sheets....ohhh the sheets.  One of those "Wynn" details I love.
Do not go. Poor client service with non-responsive management that allows unlawful practices of employees. Lots of bugs, rats and will not go again. Do not go.
Words cannot describe the quality of this hotel. It is absolutely amazing and worth saving up for yearly. I cannot say one bad thing about my stay. . . I stayed in September of 2013 in the Encore Tower Suites. Everyday, my room was made up multiple times, my room was spotless, and my toiletries were organized. My dirty cloths were even folded.  I cannot believe the care the housekeeping crew took.  Daily, breakfast was delivered to the room. It was great food and presented so nicely on amazing dinnerware and a white table cloth. The servers were excellent and insisted one morning that I don't even get out of the bed to let them in.. . Tip: Stay in the Tower Suites, book with flight to save money!
