Die Bewertung bezieht sich auf Terminal 1. das ist mit Abstand der schlechteste Terminal den ich je gesehen habe. Ekliger Teppich uberall. Es gibt auer beim uberteuerten Starbucks keine Moglichkeit etwas zu essen. Einen Food Court gibt es nicht. Es gibt zwei mager bestuckte Zeitungsladen. Einfach nur ein Witz! Eine Bar zum betrinken gibts hier zwar doch die ist geschlossen...
Not a bad airport at all!. Security line was much better than in the past.. Taxi line moves quickly too!
Big, fast-paced, and overpriced. Yay, Vegas! Things went pretty smoothly for me overall. My only suggestion would be to travel late at night to avoid insane lines.
This airport needs more restaurants!!!! I was here with my boyfriend waiting to board our flight and we had about an hour to kill so we decided to eat.  We must of walked almost the whole airport with very few choices of restaurants to eat at.  A lot of the restaurants were closed down and we were here on a Saturday afternoon.  We ended up eating at the expensive Burger King because of the very limited choices here.  What's up with that?
Worst airport ever. I'd much rather be stuck in a regional airport with no services and vending machines than spend a minute in this germ infested, airport-shaped toilet.. . IF YOU GO- smart money spends $80 to have a limo waiting for you. You're going to spend that much on buying drinks for hoochies or on that machine that's" getting ready to hit" anyway. Your hotel concierge or host will set up a limo for you and having a driver with your name on a sign waiting is pretty baller. Plus it gets you out of McCarron Hell Hole way faster.
They do a descent job given the number of travelers they serve. I wish the whole facility was non-smoking, but that's apparently a lot to ask for in Las Vegas. The food choices could also use an upgrade. But where else can you watch Blue Man Group give the TSA safety video. Points for that.
Cool airport, slots and all.  Fast baggage.  Clean and new feeling.
I like this terminal at least, not too sure about the rest of the airport. I fly either Virgin or Jet Blue and both of them go out of this spot. Clean, easy and quick. My three favorite words about any airport. . . The best part is this hidden little club called The Club at Las. You can use a Priority Pass if you have one or pay (I thinK) and it is a deal. Breakfast is light, but lunch is soup and other snacks that are very good and filling. Great bar and a even better staff.. . The food and shops in this terminal are good, but another find was the express spa that my wife went to and got a 60 minute massage. She loved...again with the clean...but that is the best part. Clean and reasonable.. . Love this place.
Say what you will about airports. I find the Vegas one fairly decent. It's clean with wide halls and also easy to find bathrooms. An absolute must after a long flight coming inbound or needing break the seal again after being out all night.. . The slots are a nice touch thoughit's a shame you can't do any sports betting. I would say the downfall is not having enough open in the early hours. Even for an airport there's a surprising sparse amount of bars once you're inside security.. . "I don't need a pillow. Give me some booze and those cookies. I'll leave you alone for 3-4 time zones."
Bleh.. . Combine a dated interior, too few charging stations, expensive drinks, and a funky smell in the air and you have the recipe for McCarran.. . Not a fan.
Jesus Lord this place is LOUD. If you have your Zen on then expect it to be shoved right out of your head as this place is just as busy as Las Vegas itself. Yes, I know...it's a dang airport and what am I expecting a koi pond in a silent park? No, I'm expecting an airport with airport noises and people everywhere. I shouldn't have been surprised that this place had slot machines all over the dang place but I was. It's a huge airport and going from terminal C to terminal A had me needing a massage and a nap but in general it's a pretty neat place to have an hour layover or to land for a weekend of debauchery.
The best airport for a layover! Not only do you have FREE Wi-Fi (Awesome), but the slot machines galore and pretty good and a decent amount of places to shop and eat as well, no matter which terminal you're in. If you ever "want" to be delayed somewhere, it should be McCarran. . As for arriving, there are limo options to the strip to beat the taxi lines that really aren't expensive, the taxi lines move very efficiently, even when looks can be disheartening, and luggage does not take long to get to the belt. It's about a 15 minute drive to the strip, so your vacation doesn't take long to begin.
There isn't particularly anything wrong with this airport there just isn't anything spectacular about it....well other than the most massive baggage claim terminal I have ever seen. . . My main gripe is the lack of good food options, when I am hungover, tired and ready to just go home and have to sit in the airport and wait for my flight while I am hungry it's not a pretty site. Having mainly fast food - and not very good fast food at that - I think there could be some improvement here.. . Oh...and quit with the smoking rooms, really it's disgusting.
I really like this airport. Being a vegas local, I have previously taken such a spacious airport with so many amenities for granted. All of that changed after flying overseas and realizing how good I had it! There are restaurants and Starbucks in every terminal. Also, this airport has various high-end gift shops (coach, MAC cosmetics, Pandora Jewelry, Brighton Collectibles, etc.), as well as the standard "Hudson News".
Not very organized. I'm glad I arrived 2 hours early because you know what might happen. It's a small airport but gets the job done. We don't need a palace of an airport just to catch a plane. LOL
Not a bad airport. Rarely have flight delays. The food vendors are decent. The only problem I have is the new baggage claim area. the shuttle brings you to the end opposite where the bags are being unloaded and this is a HUGE building. I guess it is prepping you for the walking distance between hotels on the strip...
This airport is great to fly in and out of.  It took about 15 minutes to go from checking in and through security.  Very efficient, especially with all the passengers that fly in/out. I've never had to wait long for a taxi and it's nice and close to the strip.  We paid about $17 from HGV Flamingo.. . It's spacious, has some eateries (Carl's Jr, Burger King, and restaurant) good wifi, moving walkways, and lots of recharge stations in Gate E area.   There are Best Buy and Benefit vending machines too.  Shops if you forgot to pick up a Vegas souvenir.. . The magazine/snack store charges quite a bit for water so I recommend going to one of the fast food places.  I went to the tea place and got it for $2.15, saving me a dollar! Slot machines were busy too, for those who still have money after Vegas.
Yeah, I guess if you're an airport connoisseur, then you would have a lot to say about the airports of the world. . . All I know is, I won some serious cash here on the slots before getting on my flight one time! So, maybe the slots aren't so tight at the airport as expected? . . It is one of those airports that you have to take the shuttle within the place because it's so big I guess. Last two times I went, I was disabled and their wheel walkers are the nicest people. If you do go in a chair, please tip them, they have to wheel your ass all over the place!
I'm laughing as I write this - looking at my scribbles ( yes I keep notes don't judge I'm old! ). . I remember the very first time I came to Las Vegas and I disembarked from the plane no more than 50 feet from the ramp I spied slot machines and I laughed and I laughed, got excited like a little girl and plenty in a few coins and I think I want to hundred bucks!  Glitz and flash just like the strip:) . . They get your money the moment you enter the state and they try to take your money as you leave the state.. . This airport is busy - oh my God busy. It's a mini Atlanta or a mini Chicago O'Hare airport. . . Security stinks - and speaking of stinking so does the  airport like old stale cigarettes, booze, and hang overs. Back to security - there are always long lines, security is slow - there are never enough beds and they don't refill. Take some feedback TSA McCarran let's tighten it up and get it together.. . The food situation is meh - lots of unhealthy, fast food crap. Not many restaurants pass a cutie which is a shame. The Wi-Fi is slow. Power outlets to charge phones are sparse. Hailing a taxi is a challenge. . . Okay so I have to say this - every airport facility needs to go visit PDX and TAKE NOTES do you see how a real city airport should be run. . . I'm just sayin.. . But hey it's Vegas - and we fly in with a great attitude and excitement of this being party central and we fly home sad, hung over and poor!!
