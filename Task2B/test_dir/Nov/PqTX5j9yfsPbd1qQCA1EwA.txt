If you are searching for a Classy Den on Iniquity, this is it!  Tao has an Asian Theme that is tastefully done.  It is a multi-level environment.  I attended a private Honda event so I could not access all levels.. . The security was efficient in keeping the crowd moving and organized.  They maintained a friendly yet no nonsense demeanor.. . The event featured DJ Dash Berlin.  The sound system definitely got a work out.  Although, obviously it was loud, the sound was awesome.  There were no obvious level issues.. . Platforms for dancers are prevalent.  They are scantily clad but not obscene.  Highly suggestive would be my description.. . Tao is WAY dark.  I know clubs are meant to be dark but Tao is an extreme.  Additional floor and ambient lighting would be helpful.. . Overall, Tao is a lot of fun but a little hard to navigate.  Recommended.
I used to always go to this club the first night when my friends and I ended up in Vegas.  I haven't been here in years until this one night.  My friends and I rolled up to the line on late VIP guest list. It was a short wait.  We pretty much just walked up to the front of the line.  It was near 1am.  We kind of thought we weren't going to get in (because of how late we were) but we did.  The place was still pretty packed inside; I didn't think it would be since this place has been around for awhile.  Good thing it was packed because dead clubs suck.. . Since we were late, we stayed at the bar and bought rounds of shots until we lost count.  Once we were done fueling up, we hit the dance floor.  It was so crowded there.  There was really no dancing space.  I don't think the music played was top 40s.  It was more like hip hop and trap music.  Although it felt like urban night, the crowd was mixed.  We just kept dancing and drinking and made it a forgettable night.  It was fun from what we remember lol.
We had a totally awesome time here.  We had VIP table service which was great except that it kind of felt like you were trying to get into the Pentagon and staff were Secret Service.  Besides that though the atmosphere was great.  Asian style decor with dancers in cages and women frolicking in a bathtub on stage.  The DJ was great, a good mixture of hip hop and top 40 stuff.  With our VIP we got free drinks from 10:30 to 11:30 pm.  I guzzled as many Sex on the Beaches as I could in that one hour.  There is one catch with the free drinks, you can't order just any drink, they only offer certain ones for free.  The line for the bathroom was ridiculous long but it moved pretty fast.  The dance floor was jam packed but we still were able to muscle our way out there and bust a move.  The crowd was a mix of all ages and ethnicities which was great.  Best time ever!
We went here on a "spur of the moment" type of decision on Saturday 11/15.  DJ Vice was spinning and we were staying at Palazzo.  Webooked through our casino host who plugged us into the club's host Robert.  This was my first time at Tao and our group had just gone to Marquee the night before.  People had told us that Tao was now a 2nd/3rd tier club and couldn't compare to XS, Marquee, or Hakksan.  However, it was one of the few places that did not just have EDM.  We got there and met Robert at 10:30pm.  He whisked us into the club and gave us all of the different table options.  We decided to go all out and booked an awesome table on the main dance floor (right across from the DJ booth).  We were introduced to 3 different servers ( a tad confusing at first) and our security guard Mike.  From that point on, we received awesome service.  Robert hung around for a good part of the night making sure all was good.  The table was awesome and the club was pumping.  The best perk was having Mike escort us to the restrooms.  There were always long lines for both restrooms, but we were ushered right in.  It was even more helpful when the club was in full swing and the place was a zoo.  We had ample space at our table and it was awesome not to be crammed next to 15 dudes (see my Marquee review).  You could tell that Tao could not compare to Marquee, XS, or the other newer clubs were their light/smoke shows.  But the music was bumping and there were tons of people.  We enjoyed the night actually more than at Marquee.  This was probably due to our awesome table location and the services of Robert, Mike, and our servers Anita and Shannon.  . Would definitely consider going back.
Amazing club, Amazing food... the only thing i wouldn't suggest is the sushi. Its just better on the east coast. The dj was great, club was packed and the crowd was very mixed. As for the food, I got the steak and it was spot on, my girl got the chilean seabass and it was the best i have ever had. Wasnt too expensive either.
Been to many Vegas nightclubs. TAO is one I will never go back. . -layout is terrible. dance floor is super small. Outside patio is tiny. Surrounded by desperate men who are hunting for their next prey. For example the guy next me was making out with one girl and within 30 seconds was on to the next one bc he wasn't satisfied.. . -super crowded. Can't even walk to get in or out of the club. Took us 10 minutes to walk from the patio to the bathroom bc it was so crowded.. . . -staff is absolutely Rude. They couldn't even handle the general admission versus the guest list line. I think they were all just dumb. . . -the Bathrooms. The girls bathroom stupidly located upstairs overlooks the dance floor with individual frost door rooms which you can see from the other side of the club WTF is that? Then the staff lady yelled at me bc I was next in line and didn't see that one of the very last bathroom stalls opened up. REALLY?? . . . . Hope this review helps!!!!!!
My first few Vegas trips, I wasn't able to go clubbing but dreamed of the day I could go to TAO. Now that I've been...it doesn't disappoint. The DJ is good, there's a step and repeat out front to take photos with and there's spots to smoke inside conveniently. Full disclosure: I went in as VIP so I can't really attest to the wait. I'm pretty impatient so I couldn't spend hours in line with girlfriends just to go here. But if you want the fun Vegas clubbing experience, this is an excellent place to go.. . Also love the naked girls sitting in rose petal baths near the entrance. I really don't have anything clever to add to that, except that I couldn't keep my eyes off them as I was leaving at the end of the night. Perfect ending to a fun time at TAO.
Went on a Thursday night. It wasn't crowded at all. I got in through a promoter and girls get open bar from 1030-11:30pm which was awesome! The vibe of the place is pretty cool and the outdoor patio has an amazing view!. . It started to get progressively crowded but my friends and I decided to go elsewhere. The music was alright and im sure with different djs there are different vibes.
We came here on a great vacation ruined by this Night Club of horror.  My gf got too drunk and while I was in the bathroom a predator working there, a large bald black man, took her by force and pulled her into an elevator.  He groped her and threatened to kick her out of the nightclub unless she committed explicit acts with him.  .  She obviously said no and was kicked out of the club.  Luckily she had a phone and got ahold of me but was terrified!  I took her home becauSe she was too drunk right away a and tried to call the club to complain.  Could not get ahold of any management.  Left a message and never a reply!!! Called the police made a report but my girl was too drunk to file a formal inquiry and was luckily unharmed.  . . Be very careful if you go here! Stay in groups and watch you friends or gf at all times!  I recommend not going here at all!  Very dangerous!  Who knows how many drunk women get taken advantage of here!  And not even a call back from management.  The guy probably still works there and preys on drunk women.  Dont get rapped, go party somewhere else.
