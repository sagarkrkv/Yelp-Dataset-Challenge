I was here couple months ago, is located inside of Bellagio Hotel, very outside view for the Bellagio fountain. . . Service I give 3 stars, for a restaurant inside a 5 stars hotel, I expect higher services. . . I have a lunch meeting here, I got here around 2pm, which the place was slow. . . I thought since I'm meeting someone, I will first seat at the bar and wait, and while I'm there, why not try out what they got on the menu. . . I ordered the Tuscan Farmhouse - It was just okay, nothing really brag about.. . Truffle Fries - You just can't go wrong with Truffle fries. lol . . So before my order got there, a few drunk women and guys came up and sat next to me and start speaking very loudly, so I decided to moved to a table instead.. . Since I moved from the bar to the regular table, they never assign anyone to serve me, I was sitting there for good 20 minutes, my glass is empty for awhile, no one ever bother to come check on me. Now I'm not sure how the tips work, maybe because i was sitting at the bar first, the tip should go to the bartender? I don't really care, I would have happy to pay more tip if someone willing to take care of me with refilling my glass. . . Overall, food was just okay, service is 2 stars "IF"
Believe it or not I come to this restaurant 2 days in a row! The food is so good I even missed it in my sleep!! The beef carpaccio is the best I ever had in my entire life!! The scallops were done perfect that I eventually ordered the same food!! It's a pity I live far away from here or else I would have come every week!!
I have been to Olives so many times I cannot count anymore. I have been to Vegas over a dozen times and Olives is my favorite spot in Vegas. I do not review many spots in Vegas, but I feel with some of the feedback I have seen, it is time to be real.. . This is very good, quality establishment, with a solid reputation for food, where you do not have to be in a 3-piece suit and spend a minimum of $200 to dine here. Therefore, it will be a bit busy, crowded, and hectic, pretty much from the time the doors open until they shut them at night. This is usually a good sign.. . I have never once been disappointed with the food. The grilled octopus is one of the best dishes I have ever had, and I dine in NYC often and have exposure to top notch food. If you can eat seafood, then you must try this dish. The bread and spreads you receive upon sitting down is great. The entrees are very tasty. I have had many, mostly daily specials, so I cannot pick a favorite, but you cannot go wrong.. . Olives has an extensive wine selection. You should be able to find a bottle which is to your party's liking. The sommelier has been knowledgeable and friendly every time I have had a question about a selection.. . Now, there is a bit of advice I have for anyone who wishes to dine on the patio facing the Fountains of Bellagio. Make a reservation. Get there before your reservation (20min plus). And ask if it is possible to wait for a table on the patio to open. THEY DO NOT guarantee a table then when you make your reservation. This should be obvious as to why, but some folks seem to forget that, the table you are looking to enjoy is probably a top ten, or even top 5, dining experience in Vegas. I have dined at Olives at least 10 times (AT LEAST) and all but one time I was able to get onto the patio with my parties (and this includes parties of 8+). The one time I wasn't, was due to a small wedding reception (and they probably paid a fine penny for that) which was being held early evening on a Saturday. A little savvy, a little understanding, and a little patience can go a long way.. . The service has always been impeccable. My water was never more than 2/3 empty, the wait staff was around, and the server was never rude or ignored me or my guests. Yes, at times it took a few more minutes to get my food then 'normal' (whatever that is). But with the amount of folks usually in the restaurant, this should be expected and understood.. . This establishment is one of the few finer dining establishments I would ever entertain giving 5 Stars on Yelp. So that's why I did. I highly recommend and I will return the next time I am in Sin City.
I've always wanted to see the Bellagio water fountain show while dining al fresco, and I was able to do this at Mon Ami Gabi across the street at Paris. But if you have the chance, definitely go to one of Bellagio's restaurants on the lake because your experience will be 10x better.. . With OpenTable reservations, we came by for drinks, appetizers, and desserts after lunching at Pho Kim Long in Chinatown. We actually arrived 45-minutes past our reservation time, but I'd called in advance to let them know we were stuck in traffic on the strip and subsequently had a hard time finding the restaurant. FYI, Olives is located in Bellagio's shopping area, near Louis Vuitton and Dior.. . For a table out in the patio (requested with my reservation), we waited an additional 10-minutes. The patio is a lot smaller than I envisioned and the promotional photos online definitely made it look much larger. Regardless, you still get a great view and seeing the fountain show every few minutes was cool.. . Complimentary bread is served with olive sauces that I didn't particularly like. We ordered Truffle Fries ($9), Banana Tiramisu, wine, and beer, which came to $50 incl. tax. The fries were served with ketchup, which wasn't ideal. Everyone knows truffle tastes better with garlic aioli... And if you like thin crispy fries, as I do, you probably shouldn't get these 'cause they were more like potato wedges. The tiramisu was amazingly light and delicious; I love bananas and all the textures of the lady fingers, cream, chocolate, and fruit made it one of the best tiramisus I've ever had the pleasure of eating.. . I'm unsure if I'd come back to have lunch or dinner as it's pricey and I'd rather spend that money towards something else (like dinner at Picasso on the other side of the lake); but I will definitely be back for drinks and desserts the next time I'm in town.
You'd think when making a reservation 2 weeks in advance that they would try to accommodate us. Especially considering that it was my wife's birthday and our anniversary. I requested a view seat but did not get one. I wasn't even placed next to a window. I had the view of the window 1 table away. Just terrible. The hostess was a bit too blunt for my liking. That being said our waiter, John, did provide us exceptional service. After doing some careful research I learned that the OLiVES lease has not been renewed by Bellagio. I worried about this prior to our dinner and certainly my experience echoed my concern.
This place is wonderful.  A perfect view of the fountain show.. I had a scrumptious shrimp and wild rice dish that was light and just yummy. Very nice and the view of the fountain was the best!
This restaurant is located in the Bellagio Hotel and is best known for there Mediterranean-style experience set against the breathtaking backdrop of Lake Bellagio water show.. . Service: . We had a reservation for 3 at 6:45pm and we all were running a little late but the staff held our table we all go there around 7:30pm. We were very happy they waited for us. We were instantly greeted by our waiter his name was Carl and he reminded me of Steve Harvey and he was really funny too. I knew at that point we were gonna have a good night.  He was very professional and knew the menu to a T. He recommend the popular drinks and allow us to go over the menu. . . Drinks/Starters:. My wife order some really sweet mixed drink that looked like a can of motor oil in a cup.. I just ordered a beer and my boss order a glass of wine.. They gave us bread on the table at OMG it was wonderful. It was like a raisin nut scrumdiddlyumptious roll and 3 different type olive dipping sauce. It's not good when the bread is delicious because you want more and more but then you get too full and you can't eat your dinner.. . We decide to order some appetizers. My wife order Foie Gras for $26.00 and i understand why. I ate her Foie Gras in hawaii. Sorry hun.. My boss and I tried the "Greek" Style Romaine Salad with. tomato, cucumber, cracked olives, red onion, feta phyllo triangle, oregano dressing for $17.00 ea. It was great I thought maybe that it might be weird tasting but all the ingredients work really well together. I was impressed and so was my boss.. . Our Carl i mean waiter was johnny on the spot which the refills and taking our orders which was great because we could see he was very busy but still makes time for us. I loved the service. 5 stars all the way.. . Entrees:. My Wife and I order the Chilean Sea Bass with cannellini bean & sausage cassoulet, garlicky broccolini, oj glaze, watercress for $46.00 ea. We throughly enjoyed the meal but sadly we have had better in Newport Beach, Ca and that might be because the fish is more fresh there and Vegas fish is frozen. I am not sure but it was still good. 3 stars.. . My Boss ordered Linguine Alle Vongole with littleneck clams, red pepper flakes, white wine & garlic, parsley for $36.00. He said it was really good and he loves Vongole and it was right on point. . . Dessert:. We order a Mango, Berry, Watermelon Sorbet which was 3 scoops and it was so silky and amazing. Not to sweet and bit tangy. We all shared it and it was perfect because my wife likes mango, I liked the watermelon and my boss loves the berry and it couldn't be more perfect.. . Experience:. Overall the total service and meal were 5 stars and I would definately come back when we are in Vegas again. It was rad that our table was close to the window because we could see the Water Show while we were dining. We left with full belly and great memories.. . Thanks Olives aka Carl for making our night and to my boss for paying for everything. Cheers!
For a most delicious fig and prosciutto flatbread, top notch wine list, mouth watering bellini martinis- you must try Olives- Bellagio! The pasta dishes are abundant and delicious- the grilled octopus/squid dish is not to be missed. Try to sit at Gray's tables, on the outside deck, for a most enjoyable dining experience.  The staff, especially Gray, make the experience at Olives very pleasant to say the least. The water show is not to be missed- Take the opportunity to have this experience!
I simply cannot recall a more pleasant dining experience within many years! Based on reviews, I made a reservation, then requested outdoor seating upon arrival, in order to enjoy the Bellagio fountain. We only had to wait an additional 45 minutes, and I strongly recommend you do the same! The simple act of dining al fresco while enjoying the fountain's visual and aural display, would have been enough, but was wonderfully complemented by a splendid meal. Both presentation and quality proved without reproach. My steak was properly blackened, with a most flavorful presentation of green beans with garlic potatoes. The pre dinner bread selection was unique in its variety, and this olive-hater enjoyed the olive toppings served with the breads. Not an easy feat, mind you! The prices were reasonable considering the competition at Bellagio. The staff seemed eerily able to provide service while remaining nearly invisible,providing the perfect amount of attention. I hope your experience is as perfect!
Came here for dinner on Thursday night at 6:45. Although we had reservations for 5 people, we still waited a good 15 mind for our table. . Ambience: this place was happening. The vibe is nice, especially on the patio. Clientele appeared more business oriented. Older crowd by far. . Service: mostly it was really good. Out waiter was on top of things. They did recommend a veggie dish that turned out to have meat. That was corrected right away. Water was constantly refilled. Food came out at a decent pace. The waiters recommendation was good. My only issue was that the rib eye special ran out by our 7pm slot.. Food: overall food was good. I wasnt impressed with the bread (cold and hard). The beef carpaccio was really good. It is def meant to share and came out like a salad. Very good flavor. You wouldnt even know you were eating raw beef. My main entree (since they ran out of the rib eye) was the lamb pops. I asked them if they can have the same accompaniment as the rib eye (lobster mac n cheese and bacon brussel sprouts). The lamb was good and cooked well but only had 3 pieces. I would have liked four for my main entree. The mac n cheese was disappointing. It was mixed in with the brussels sprouts and i couldnt even locate the lobster. The Brussels sprouts were ok. Maybe i should have opted for the sea bass. That got rave reviews. . Vegas has a ton of great restaurants. I would prob opt to try a different one. Its not bad but nothing that stands out.
Had an amazing dinner for two last night at Olive's. The food was EXCELLENT. I ordered the chicken & artichoke flatbread with grilled shrimp on the side. Everything tasted wonderful...even chicken-which can sometimes be bland & tasteless-was amazing! It had an orangey glaze which I've never experienced before in any meal. My bf ordered the free range roasted chicken...I could tell he loved it because he ate everything on his plate!. . The reason I only gave four stars: we had reservations & still had a TWENTY MINUTE WAIT. Not cool. Inside the restaurant it was extremely noisy, so we asked to be seated out on the patio. The patio is awesome because it's much less noisy, plus you get to see the Vegas skyline & Bellagio dancing fountain. . . Another good thing about this place: our wait staff was very friendly & attentive...even took pics of me & my date for us...then posed for his own cameo:)
The only thing negative i can say about Olives is the wait time. However the wait we had even though we had reservations was worth it. They ended up seating us on the balcony so we could watch the great fountain show. Our waiter was really great and funny and the managers would come around to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. Theres no complaints about the food. I had the free range roasted chicken and all i can say is that chicken died for a good cause.
Me and my wife want there for . Celebrating anniversary. . The food was in the table in 15-20 min . And the taste was beyond expectation. Love this restaurant for good ! . I would recommend it to everyone I know.
We have been going to Olives for three years and Jon has always made our experience perfect.  He is a great bartender and his attention to service is appreciated.  He always makes sure our experience is perfect and makes us feel like we are VIPs.  We love Olives.
Nice restaurant, good food and GREAT service.  Chris V was our waiter and he was very personable, went above and beyond to give us an really enjoyable experience and he wasn't afraid to tell us what he really liked.  Ask for him if you go, you can tell he likes his job!
Confused that the Yelp listing is not Todd English's Olives, as the restaurant signage, menu, and promotional materials state. I guess Todd himself dined here and had an experience similar to mine, and didn't want his name associated with the place.. . The food ranged from tasty cheese on the charcuterie board and surprisingly good espresso martinis, to average/mediocre everything else- and we ordered a lot. Tables are initially served a breadbasket with three mismatched breads, and a tray of olives and two tapenades- the green is best.. . CHARCUTERIE BOARD: two types of tasty cheeses (one was a blue), two types of meat (salami and prosciutto?), dates, candied walnuts, and crisps. Wish I could tell you what type of cheese it was, but all dishes were presented without any sort of explanation or comment.. FOIE GRAS: served with fresh fig (singular), port reduction (gross), and truffle crema (tastless, certainly no truffle here). Served without any sort of crackers or bread, and our breadbasket was empty and no one ever refilled it.  Did not care for the texture, flavors seemed off. Would have shared this with my server, but we never saw him.. . BRICK OVEN ROASTED FREE RANGE CHICKEN: served with a potato cake and green means, all amid a sea of tasty jus, but the chicken itself was bland. Recurring issue with dishes here. Again, even just salt would have helped this dish.. BONE-IN NY STRIP SPECIAL: served with green beans and fingerling potatoes, steak was plated with a giant puddle of some sort of cabernet sauce? Guess it was meant to hide the fact that the meat was flavorless aside from gobs of fat in every bite, and unseasoned to the point that it desperately needed salt. No char or sear at all. . . MUSHROOM RISOTTO: decent-ish side, mediocre version of a favorite dish. The table ate the entire portion though.. CRISPY ZUCCHINI: no menu description, expected a roasted version but received a plate of tempura zuke covered with cheese. Hard not to like that but odd considering the rest of the menu. . . As you can see, we had issues with the service. The restaurant wasn't that busy, yet we rarely saw our server. Literally went 20 minutes wanting a martini that I couldn't order because he never came by. When he did, he didn't seem to care at all. We were asked what we wanted to drink, what we wanted to order, and if we had any questions- no intro, no script, no explanation of specials, devoid of personality. Didn't even ask to see a dessert menu because we were so put off by the flavorless food and nonexistent service.
I went there recently on a trip to Las Vegas. They do have a fun drink menu. They have  variety of breads which were all delicious. The salad was yummy and the food was good.  I did feel like everything took way too long.  Maybe that's just the Way they do things in Las Vegas, but I typically don't enjoy spending three hours at one meal.
The host and hostess went out of their way to make sure we had amazing table for my birthday.  It was very much appreciated.
Great upscale atmosphere. Loved the bread with the olive tapenade. Shared Bibb salad with white onions and sprinkled with blue cheese, a walnut vinegarette dressing. I had the ravioli filled with pureed peas and fava beans smothered in mushrooms and more peas and fava beans. A white wine and butter sauce. If you love mushrooms, you'll love this.
Sorry, but = nope.. . Stuffy.  Lacked vibe and personality.. Overpriced (portions were tiny, too).. Plates were good, as in they tasted good.. Service lagged.  We had to flag the waitress down more than once .. And this after waiting a hot minute in the first place.. They weren't slammed, either.. . Only thing that was on pointabout this spot:  the Bellagio water show goes off right in front of you .. which is dope.
We went here with 20 relatives for my father's birthday. It was quite good. I had a filet and sampled many other entrees and appetizers. The drinks were good. Like most restaurants on the Strip, the waitstaff was very mechanical and unenthusiastic, but they were very efficient. My niece (and I) enjoyed running out to see the water show every 30 minutes. They sang and brought out a piece of cake.
Whenever I come to Vegas this isn't first stop to grab a late lunch. I usually love this place although yesterday was a complete disappointment. The food was just awful. The Cesar salad came out wilted and the tomatoes were not fresh, they were pruney and appeared days old. The chicken was dry and tasted like it had been sitting under hot lights for hours. The food was clearly not fresh and even the pizza which is hard to mess up tasted bland and boring. It's sad but olives has lost it's luster. This won't be my first stop anymore, it's sad to see a good restaurant fall off in quality and taste.
My date and I were walking around Bellagio looking for somewhere to have dinner. We settled on Olives because we couldn't find any where else to eat and we were too hungry to keep looking. At first we were kind of put off because we knew this place would be pricy and wedidn't intend on eating such a meal at the time, but I really don't regret eating here at all. Our waiter was great and pretty funny. He offered to change our white napkins for black napkins so we can "stay sharp". Our bread basket also came with a black napkin. The attention to detail was cute.. . We ordered the Beef Carpaccio, Turkey Lasagna, and Roasted Free Range Turkey (it was Thanksgiving so they had a Turkey menu). The Beef Carpaccio was amazing. I wish I could eat it everyday. Under it was some kind of salad and a bread thing that was wonderful too. The turkey entrees were good too. I think the Turkey Lasagna had a strawberry sauce that was yummy. There was so much turkey in the lasagna!!! There was a big portion of lasagna and I couldn't finish it. :(. . Overall this place had great service and the best was the Beef Carpaccio!! The turkey entrees were okay.
The atmosphere is very inviting and if you can snag a seat on the patio add 2 more stars.  However, we sat inside and we were not wowed by the food.   17 dollars for two small heads of romaine lettuce, anchovies and store bought croutons was really over the top. My hubby's truffle burger was very good, but 21 dollars?  I should add that the bread basket with olives and tapenade were great.
Pros.. . 1. Very good wine list (drink menus on ipad) . 2. Serves olive and olive spread with the bread . 3. Good service. . Cons.. . 1. Even if you make a reservation and go right when they open its not guaranteed that they will give you a patio seat . 2. Pricey for mediterranean food (we paid about $300 for everything including tip & tax and 3 drinks)
