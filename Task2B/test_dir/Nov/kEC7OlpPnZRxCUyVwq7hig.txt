The biggest issue with this hotel is that I booked what was listed as a suite in an all suite tower.  Yet the room I received couldn't be called a suite by any stretch of the imagination.  It was an average hotel room, and no, having a sofa in a the room does not make it even a Jr. Suite. Plenty of hotel rooms have those.  So I have to say their advertising is pretty misleading.  But with that said, I paid about $40 for the room (during a huge convention none the less) so I cant complain too much.  It was a nice room -- very clean, all white and grey modern decor which I liked a lot.  Except I didnt enjoy the photo of Pete Wentz urinating on the wall next to the bed. Im pretty sure no one wants to look at that.. . The hotel itself is pretty cool -- much smaller than most but I enjoyed the decor. It definitely screamed rock but not in a pretentious way.  The bar drinks were good but they need a drink menu with good, sweet drinks, and a bartender who is a bit more friendly.  The dining choices at the hotel are just okay -- I ended up walking across the street to get food most of the time.  And thats what I liked the most about staying there.  There's a strip mall across the street with Korean BBQ, Sushi, Indian Food, a Mexican Cantina, all of my favorites, not to mention a convenient CVS.. . I didnt have any problems with the staff. I did have issues with some of the douchebag, bro types who stay at places like this and think it's okay to harass women for just walking into the hotel. Of course the hotel cant control their actions, but this type of place tends to attract a certain clientele.. . Overall, the value was good for what I paid for it.
Stayed here for a bachelor party. Rooms were nice, condition was great. The pools are very interesting....why someone would pay $30 to go to the Rehab pool when the regular pool was free and had better drink specials without the blaring music is beyond me. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THE IN-HOTEL DINING. Especially for breakfast. Unless you want corned beef hash that come out like soup and has frickin carrots in it! Carrots? Come on, geez.
Beautiful room just off the strip. The down - airport close enough that you can hear planes fly by and walls were thin in paradise towers so we could hear the next rooms TV. But if you not a light sleeper. The hotel amenities are numerous and amazing. And your in Vegas who needs sleep anyway! Your so tired you pass out almost immediately! Just like Vegas they charge for what seems like everything! We joked they were going to charge us for using our chargers for our cellphones.
Actually one of my favorite hotels in Vegas. While not on the strip, the rooms are fabulous (the beds you could just sleep in forever), the restaurants are some of my favorite in Vegas (Nobu, Culinary Dropout) and the staff is always so friendly. . . I was there this last time for just a day and ordered room service. The food is delicious and they are so accommodating. I wanted cookies, but they only sold them by the dozen. The chef offered to send me a few for a few dollars. WORTH IT. They were so good! . . When my food was delivered I was so hungry that I forgot that my room looked like a bomb exploded (ahem) and so when I let the waiter in and saw the look on his face I was so humiliated! I apologized profusely and then he came back with some chocolate covered strawberries to apologize! It wasn't his fault, but what a nice gesture!. . I love this hotel, everyone is on point. The only thing I disliked was paying for an upgrade and getting a corner room on a low floor with a half view of the strip and a huge parking lot. I shouldn't have had to pay extra for that so I complained and they comped my upgrade so all was well!. . Get here, super posh rooms, great room service, can hold their own on the restaurant scene and you won't find a huge crowd of drunk chicks in stilettos retching on the sidewalk because they aren't close to the strip. Win.
ugh! I stayed at the Hard Rock over the weekend for my sister's bachelorette party shenanigans and I walked away feeling disappointed and angry. Not only is the hotel/casino depressing, the employees are so rude! Below are a few examples of the employees having bad attitudes:. . 1. The hotel has a new policy that bell hops are not allowed to bring food or beverages up to the room for you. That's lame but whatever. The bell hop we had was very matter of fact about it and unapologetic. He acted annoyed and he was a total jerk when we pressed him for more information about it.. . 2. We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights and requested the rooms be near each other if not right next to each other. When we checked in we asked to make sure they were near each other and they were not. They were on complete opposite sides of the tower. When we asked if we could have them next to each other the gentleman at the check-in desk said it was really busy and they were still trying to get rooms together. We said that was ok and we could wait until 2 rooms next to each other were ready and he said "Well it could be 1 hour or it could be 5 hours. I have no idea so I don't know what to tell you." SO UNHELPFUL and not very accommodating at all.. . 3.. Our friend called down to the bell desk to ask for her luggage and they said they weren't very busy so it would only be about 15 minutes.. It was clearly taking longer to she called down to check on it. My friend: "Hi I'd like to follow up on my luggage. It's been about 30 minutes since I called down and you said it would be up in 15 minutes." Bell desk: "Actually it's only been 27 minutes! We're very busy so you're going to have to wait!" uuhhh.....what?. . 4. We were getting ready to go out for the night and the bride-to-be wanted to grab a quick appetizer before we started to drink a lot so we went into Pink Taco. There were about 9 of us girl and we decided that rather than get a table we would just sit at the bar. The bar only had about 3 other people at it so there was plenty of room for us. Only a few of us were going to be eating and the rest of the girls wanted to get a drink while we waited for them. When the 4 girls who were going to eat asked for a menu at the bar the bar tender looked at the other bartender, rolled his eyes and said "what the hell is this!" and walked away...leaving the other bartender to help us. We were all ordering drinks...we were all paying customers...I'm so confused as to why the bar tender was annoyed that a few of the girls wanted to eat.  Then one of the girls needed a paper napkin so she asked the bartender if she could get a few napkins.  He looked at her with eyes of disgust, picked up the linen napkin that was in front of her, and proceeded to dangle it in front of her face like she was an idiot and didn't know it was there. When she actually just needed a paper napkin so that's why she asked for one.. . 5. We went into The Ainsworth, which is a little lounge type bar inside the casino. One of my friends ordered a drink from the bar and the total was $7.00. She gave the bartender a $20 bill and the bartender only gave her $8.00 back. The money was sitting on the bar and before she even reached to put it away she told the bartender "Oh, I think you forgot to the other $5.00" since the change was supposed to be $13.00.  The bartender said "Oh really?!?!" in a very condescending tone and then said "Let's check the cameras then!" My friend was absolutely dumbfounded. The guy standing next to her backed up her claim, that she was given the wrong change. But the bartender denied it. When my friend asked for a manager and tried to explain what happened and let him know the bartender was treating her unfairly, he refused to help her at all. He did end up giving her the $5.00 she was owed, but only after 15 minutes of arguing about it.. . I do have to mention, though, that the maid we had was the nicest person on the planet and we loved her. We also had a positive experience in the center bar...the cocktail waitress there was really sweet.
Simply put, this place is a 24 hour party.. From the second you walk into the lobby, you're greeted by a sea of 20 something's that are hammered regardless of what time it is. I came here for a bachelor party a few years ago, so this pretty much fit the mood of what everyone was going for.. . We stayed in the celebrity suite which was huge. It's a one bedroom suite that comes with a huge living room, dining area and another (optional) attached room with two queen beds. There are floor to ceiling doors  that open up to birds eye view of the massive pool where parties are hosted, including the world famous, Rehab party of Sundays. There was also a large leather couch with plenty of other seating in the room.  For five dudes, it worked out perfectly. Rooms aren't anything modern, but there's good enough.. . The main issue with this hotel is it's off the beaten path. You definitely need a taxi to get to the strip and there's pretty much nothing else around the hotel. If you're coming to Vegas to do the strip and want to be around a higher standard clientele (and have the money), you're much better off at the Cosmo or Bellagio. If you're mainly in Vegas for Rehab and are in you're 20's, this is the place for you!
As a business guy I thought I would check hard rocks reviews....... I was floored that only have a 3 star yelp average.  I come to HRH no less then 3x times a year......   I stay at HRH because threat me right.. I don't ask for free stuff stuff. But they always treat me like family . . Only a 5 stars for me
We walked to the Hard Rock from the strip almost daily for the KISS concert and events throughout the week.  It's about a 20-25 minute walk and don't have to fight to get through crowds.  Most people we met said it was so far away, but we didn't mind the walk at all and you don't need a taxi to take to/from the strip if you like to walk.  I like the casino with all the music memorabilia.  You will see photos, guitars, and attire from all types of musicians.  The Joint is in the hotel so great to see a concert here and the concierge will hold your bags as you can't take in.. . Before the concert, we grabbed a bite to eat at one of the restaurants.  I saw there are a few to choose from Asian to pub food.  There's the Hard Rock restaurant just across the parking lots from the front doors of the hotel.  The Monster mini golf, CVS, and other restaurants are close across the streets.. . For shopping, there's John Varvatos and Affliction stores.  The pool area is nice with a slide and deep water.  The airplanes often flying near this hotel and our friends told us it can be heard in the room but not in the night.. . The casino didn't seem as big as some of the others on the strip.  Still lots of cool rock slots to play including Rolling Stones, KISS, ZZ Top, and more.
Pretty nice hotel. Honestly the only downside is that they don't have a lot of places to eat inside. The hotel is pretty nice. Pretty clean for a casino. They have some shops and a nice bar by the Pink Tacos restaurant. Saw kiss in concert this weekend there. Nice place. Have lots of music memorabilia.  I actually prefer tosee concerts here. Hotel is not on the strip but it not super far. I suggest you take a cab though. About $9 for the ride depending on where you get dropped off. Beware of taxi lines after the shows. You could be waiting and hour!  Would like to stay here one time. Seems like a pretty fun place.
Bad service. Hotel rooms are nice, but they charged me an extra $150+ for TOUCHING - NOT CONSUMING - TOUCHING the drinks in the room refrigerator. How is that legal? Also, the Pink Taco restaurant is disgusting. I should've known better. This is why I hate Vegas.
