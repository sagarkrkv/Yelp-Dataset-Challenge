Came here for lunch after a long night of Halloween celebrations. The food, the drinks, and the laid back atmosphere all hit the spot. The beer mimosa was delicious, as was the pulled pork sandwich. The service was efficient and very good, as well.  Most importantly, the music wasn't too loud. We'll be back.
Good food, great beers.  I'd suggest it to anyone.  The crowd is loud and young.  If you're 22, you already know this.  They get really packed and there's a line and wait whenever I go.. . It's a bar for twenty somethings.  A really good one.
A nice find tonight.  A strange location in a residential area albeit mainly university students.  Food was great pub food and the Hops IPA was refreshing.  A definite return visit is in order soon!  The place was buzzing for a Tuesday night and from what I hear is a tough seat to get most nights due to its popularity.
Can't go wrong with their IPA!
The food here is off the hook! Beer bread sandwiches are delicious and the fish and chips are some of the best around! And then there's the beer itself! The only one I personally don't care for is the Peach Ale, but if you like peach I'm sure it'll do it for you! If you're in during the fall give the Pumpkin Porter a try and if you're real lucky they'll have Double Pumpkin on hand. . . On to the service, nine times out of 10 it's on point. And if it isn't, the management cares and wants to know! Today my wife and I went in for lunch, grabbed a table outside. There was still a bill folder on the table from the last customer, combine that with a change of servers and they didn't realize we had just sat down. No big deal, after about five minutes I casually asked the nearest server if we could get some help.The manager quickly came by and let us know he'd make up for it. I reiterated that it wasn't a big deal. Well, the entire bill was comped less the growler of PP we got to go. WTG! You didn't need to, but you ensured already loyal customers left happy. If it happens to you, don't forget to tip your server what they deserve for the amount of work done. Appreciate the service, Jen!
Horrible brewery. You don't allow a 25 year old from Wisconsin because his license is vertical. Just awful customer service. I hope your brewery burns to the ground. You are a horrible corporate monster. It should be about the beer, not screwing over out of state customers. Only giving one star because I can't give zero stars.
Anti-swank. Come as you are.  It has a garage meets dorm room sensibility. Attach that to top notch beer, really good food and a fun atmosphere it makes for a hell of a nice place to hang out, especially during patio season.
There is a time and place for everything... a beer fills most of those time slots! If you are a local then you know the Four Peaks, but if you are transient visitor to Phoenix then let me fill you in. This brewery is one of the best places to eat in Tempe. It has one of the best Salmon BLTs I have ever had. And this all from a person who is not, admittedly so, a beer person. I enjoy the occasional draft and this joint has enough to keep the beer flowing like wine all night (Dumb & Dumber). There is a outdoor section that is really fun during the cooler seasons and the indoor seating area gives a great feel of being inside the inner workings of a real brewery with soul. I sincerely enjoy the hanging flags representing the different global influences on their craft. The staff is pleasant enough, the only issue can be wait time since this place is typically jumping!
The beer here is great and so is the food. They have a wide selection of their own beers as well as a good list of featured beers from other breweries. The sunbru, peach ale, and kilt lifter are all personal favorites. In terms of the food, any of the burgers are great. The fries are probably the best fries I've ever eaten (order a side of the sweet jalapeno sauce to dip your fries in, it's the best). They have really good blackened chicken quesadillas and the pizzas are pretty good too!
Great fish not so much chips.   Not a huge fan of the fries. They are beer battered and kinda greasy, but not the worst I've ever had.     We got a half order of nachos to start they were plenty for four of us.   Lots of cheese and chicken was cooked to perfection.   Everything else came on the side.   Very good.   Very nice lunch indeed.
This place was more than awesome. I've been to breweries, but none that had a restaurant inside. I was jacked to eat & drink here when I found so many positive reviews on Yelp. The place must've known my presence ahead of time, because our group sat closest to the back where the yeast smell was strongest. . Decided to get the beer sampler, our server was awesome as he gave me an extra sample of their seasonal pumpkin beer. I personally wasn't a fan of it but the gesture was nice. I really liked their peach beer, never had anything quite like it. . Appetizers [edamame & pretzels] were hearty. My meal was the chicken fingers & fries. I couldn't hardly finish it because there was soooo much. The beer batter on the chicken was nothing like I'd had before. . I foresee many more visits here, what a great place for the Valley!
I really do enjoy this place everytime I go.  They have a great patio with lots of shade to sit outside and enjoy a cold beer and a meal.  Last time I went, we ordered the Blackened Chicken Nachos (they were pretty tasty, though not the best around by a long shot) and the spinach / avocado dip, which was delicious.  . . The entrees we ordered were also very good.. . Fish & Chips: the fish was excellent and lightly breaded with their signature beer batter.  Chips were also lightly breaded in their batter, but I personally prefer my fries un-breaded. . . Burger & Fries:  Black Angus burger cooked to perfection (med-rare) and was very flavorful and juicy.  Again, fries breaded.... . Pizza:  I didn't actually try the pizza, but it looked good and smelled delicious.. . 4 Peaks is always a fun place to stop and at least have a beer or two!
I can't believe it's been years since I have updated my review! Four Peaks is one of those places that I like bringing out of town guest to, and also great place to just hang out with friends too!. . I still think the Popper Burger is outstanding, just so fresh and good! And if you haven't tried the Nachos, man you should, delsih!  I have tried a few fights within the last couple of years, but have to say my favorite is the Peach Ale, sometimes I just cave a Peach Ale in a frosty cold glass! So good!. . I have even tried some of the dessert a time or too, if you go and have a sweet tooth bugging ya, try the Stoutamisu, you won't be disappointed. . Four Peaks still a favorite place for me, I'm sure I'll be back soon!
It's Four Peaks. Enough said.. . This place is a staple in Tempe and you will never regret coming here. The beer is great, the food is great, the atmosphere is great. I always find myself searching for boxes of Kiltlifter when I'm out at Costco (which is an awesome deal, by the way). The nachos are to die for and the Oatmeal Stout is by far my favorite beer here. Definitely grab the seasonal beers as they come in, too! Be wary though, sometimes happy hour prices don't apply to the special beers.
Went here for the first time this past Tuesday and the place was packed.  On. A. Tuesday!  That is surely due to the fact that this place is right by ASU campus and the food and beer is incredible.. This is first and foremost a brewery after all.... Had a couple of their famous brews...  Kiltlifter and a pumpkin seasonal and both were ice cold and so tasty!  Fish and chips were perfect and some of the best I've had anywhere.. All the bartenders and waitresses look like models and it is loud and fun here.  If you are into the scene I described you will love this place!!  Only 4 stars cuz parking sucks ass.
What can I say about this place except that one of my favorite places to go!!! . . Food is BOMB! Beer is BOMB! This place is BOMB!
My favorite local brewery! Food is always delicious, and the beers are awesome. It's always busy, which is a sign of a good place. Parking isn't always the greatest, but it's worth parking down the street and walking. The Peach Ale is my personal favorite, but all of their beers really are delicious! If you're searching for food options, I LOVE the spinach and artichoke dip, and their beer breads and french dip is delicious too. You really can't go wrong with whatever you order. Definitely a great spot to visit if you're new to the area or if you have out of town guests. A really great AZ experience!
Beer was excellent!  Had the seasonal double pumpkin ale and really enjoyed it. I come from Portland Oregon so I'm always looking for great beer. Pretty satisfied with what I had tonight!!  . . I ordered a pizza and am so spoiled by all the great places at home so, sorry I couldn't get that fifth star but the pizza wasn't great. It didn't taste housemade and I'm pretty sure the crust was bought and not made in house. But... the other food we had was good and everyone seemed to love their choices. . . Great location and great staff that accommodated my crazy sister and her dog. Dog had to sit outside the patio fence and we sat inside the fenced area. Fine by me and everyone was okay. . . Go for the beer and order a burger... they looked great!
This place never fails me. And a bonus, Odelay! Is on tap, is a beautiful Mexican chocolate beer. Now I wish I had some chocolate to go with it.
The biggest downside of Four Peaks is the parking situation. If you go during a peak time, you may end up walking as far as a half a mile to actually get to it. But that speaks to it's popularity, and it's quality. They have good food and great beer.
Great selection of brews and a huge location! They don't take reservations but they do accommodate large parties with minimal wait. . . Not only is the location huge, so are the portions... I had no idea. We started with an order of spicy Thai hummus with pita bread.  It was pretty tasty, the bread was soft and fresh and the hummus had a nice kick.  Other appetizers at the table where the spinach and artichoke dip, and the giant nachos.... Every appetizer was plenty for 3 to 4 people to share.  . . For my entree I went with the vegetable beer bread sandwich and fries.  The sandwich was okay, the bread was very thin and made into a wrap which I thought was interesting, but it got soggy fast so I ended up not eating the bread and just eating the vegetables out of the inside.  The fries on the other hand, beer battered and crispy...just the way I like them. . . I saw some pizzas floating around the restaurant too, next time I think that's definitely what I'm going to go for they looked amazing.  . . Overall this was a fun place, great service, decent (and very affordable) bar food and cool atmosphere for dinner.
