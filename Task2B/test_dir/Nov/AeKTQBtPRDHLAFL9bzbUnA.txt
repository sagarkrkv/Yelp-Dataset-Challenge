Pretty good AYCE sushi. We waited for about 15 minutes on Sunday around 6:30pm. It was surprising since it is not a big place. . . We ordered a lot! I mean everything at once. The nigiri was very fresh. The sake and white tuna were the best. The uni and sweet shrimp (only allowed one per order) were very good too.  It was hard that you have to eat all of the rice. I would recommend not get any of the rolls. None of the four that we ordered were that good. The 911 roll was good but very very spicy. The spider roll was not authentic at all. . . All the side orders are very yummy. The shrimp tempura, spicy chicken teriaky, seaweed salad, etc. . . Would definitely go back next time I am in Vegas.
It used to be great, but they've been skimping on portions and the quality of rice they use is subpar at best.   Hopefully they will change that because this was our spot to eat whenever we go to Vegas.
I love that's like $20 for all you can eat sushi it's a amaazzzziiinngg  it was my first time  and it was totally worth it . I recommend you go
Service was extremely fast, almost too fast! Sat at the bar and had wonderful customer service. . Hot sake is great, . 9-1-1 HOLY SHIT. I'm still chugging on my water.. I love and can handle spicy, but this is by far THE spiciest I've had yet. . . RECOMMENDED . The Mingus . -- even if you aren't a fan of fish or sea food I suggestyou give this a shot to break into the scene. Absolutely delicious for anyone. . . Only thing I would say is I wish there was some environmental music in here, some gentle Japanese or something for environment factor.. Rather than the crying baby!
Amazing place! Well worth the wait!  The hostess stated a 45min wait and it turned into only 15 minutes.  Staff was average but the food was spectacular!  Creations of the rolls were original and full of flavor. Must order is the calamari!  This is a definite go to sushi house.
Awesome sushi spot with their all you can. eat it definitely hits the spot.. . I tried their halibut sashimi and it was sublime!. . Also, don't forget to order some sake and beers or both to enhance your all you can eat experience.
Gosh darn it, why do I love sushi so much.  This place is no exception.  Take my money!. . Lunch is $23 and dinner is $27.  The only difference is for dinner you get one order of Uni (Sea Urchin) and Sweet Shrimp.  You also get a few more "specials of the day" items to choose from.  Definitely worth it if you eat those things, otherwise try for lunch.  . . I've tried eating here before but left after we heard the wait was 2+ hours.  This time, we came at an odd hour (3:30PM) on a Saturday and were luckily able to get seated for 10 people without issue.  Note, NOT everyone in your party has to eat AYCE, which I was surprised to hear.  This worked out great for us.. . Everything we ordered was amazingly fresh and tasty.  Definitely not the cheap sh*t. Love the ton of options and the grean tea creme brulee was a nice touch to end it all.  Service was also attentive and quick.  However,  the sushi to rice ratio is not that great here, but the freshness kind of makes up for it.  Just looked at my thumb and that's about how much rice you get per sushi (I have a medium sized thumb).  The fish on top is just a small sliver.. . While I liked this place a lot compared to the other 4-5 AYCE sushi places I've tried in Vegas, there's still another AYCE sushi place in Vegas I enjoy a tad bit more.  A better sushi to rice ratio and even more options make me like that place more.  Check out my reviews to find out which one.  Hence, 4 rightfully deserved yelp stars from me, Goyemon.
I have returned! Much to my amazement the food & service is still outstanding! Still an awesome off the strip sushi spot to dine at!. . This time we came on a Monday for lunch and beat the mad lunch rush! Whew~ . We dined for about 1.5 hours for the AYCE sushi and ate til we had to unbutton our pants :). . :: GOTTA HAVE IT (4/5) ::. - Sashimi Salad. - Seaweed Salad. - Garlic Tuna Sushi. - Salmon Sushi. - Dynamite. - Pixie Roll. . :: LOVE IT  (3/5)  ::. - Baked Mussels. - Tuna Poki. - XTC Roll. - YellowTail Sushi. - Frying Jason Roll. - Tempura Ice Cream. . :: LIKE IT  (2/5) ::. - Yum Yum Scallop Sushi. . :: NOT DYING TO HAVE IT AGAIN  (1/5) ::. - Moon Roll  (there was no fresh water eel). - Jala Jala Roll
Pretty decent AYCE sushi place.....good ambiance and good quality fish. My only complaint is from the cuts of fish i received for my Nigiris.....sinewy pieces of tuna, and bloodline still left on the Hamachi. Yellowtail is my favorite fish for nigiris and it was unpleasant having a large portion of my fish being bloodline. And they displayed the bloodline side smh. That aside eveything was pretty good. I would visit again.
Here for the AYCE and I have not even finished dinning but already I can write a review about this place. Awesome!!! Quality is great service is great just all around a really good place for sushi!!!
We came here with a friend who liked the place. It was packed but we had reservations, got in the door with a 15 min wait. We opted for all you can eat. We had eel, super white,  the excatsy roll, and the moon roll. The fish was pretty fresh , minimal rice. But we waited 20 minutes for drinks. We got some of our food before we got our water and sprite..  Service was slow for a 30% tip. We waited 25 minutes for a moon roll... I would not recommend or make the drive back. Our mussels were sent back twice and they came back cold twice . The sauce they used looked shady. Very thick and overwhelming taste of mayo.yuck
I almost felt like i was betraying our AYCE sushi spot, coz we're like family when we walk into that restaurant but my boyfriend couldnt wait for that spot to open up so he searched out this place.  its small but clean, we sat at the bar and got the AYCE. decent menu its almost identical except that quality was a taaaaaaaad bit better than our usual spot. price wise its decent, might as well get the AYCE since you practically pay for that in like 2 sushi rolls.... we got a pitcher of beer and tried all the items that you can get only one per person for dinner. all the kitchen items are small but its all you can eat so yea. made friends with our sushi chef, he seems to hook us up and suggest certain sushi, overall it was good. had a great time as always with my boyfriend for dinner and liked the food. will be returning.
This is at least my 50th dinner at Goyemon and I must say I've never been let down once. The quality of fish and service from the staff is unparalleled. At this point the sushi chefs know my order by heart and have it out for me within minutes. I would definitely recommend the Hurricane and Magma rolls.
Quite a bit of a trek off the strip if you are staying in that area as I usually am, but the quality of food for an all you can eat option for lunch or dinner is out of this world. Some menu items were fairly unique to this restaurant and not something I have seen in other sushi restaurants.  Definitely fun for a group that is all willing to order the all you can eat to be able to pass around items for sampling. I will definitely be back!
Goyemon! I love you! Definitely my favorite place now for all you can eat sushi. I'm not a sushi expert or anything but I know a great deal when I see one! Every time I've come, sushi has been pretty fresh, food has come somewhat fast and I always leave satisfied! There's usually a wait but to me, they're worth it! The only I don't like is that their stamp card now has like a two month expiration on it. Okay I like sushi, but I think it's safe to say that the majority of people would have a hard time eating sushi 10 times in 2 months. Mehh, lame. But anyways.... . My favorite rolls-. . Lemon: California roll wrapped with yellowtail, salmon and sliced lemon drizzled with ponzu. . Moon: Fresh water eel, scallop yum and avocado served with eel sauce on bed of tempura crumb. . Puffy: Fresh water eel, cream cheese, cucumber and avocado topped with smelt eggs & eel sauce. . Moment: Shrimp tempura, scallop yum and avocado topped with smelt eggs & eel sauce. . Hurricane: Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, cucumber and avocado topped with salmon tempura, smelt eggs & green onion drizzled with eel sauce spicy yum yum sauce & mayonnaise. . Pixie: Deep fried soft shell crab, spicy shrimp yum, cucumber and avocado wrapped in soy paper with smelt eggs & eel sauce on top. . Yum Yum!!! and for the desserts, I love the Lychee Sherbert, Tempura Ice Cream, and Green Tea Creme Brulee!
Food is always amazing. I love the variety on their A.Y.C.E. menu and service was particularly on it tonight.. . They don't take reservations so anticipate a wait time to be seated.
This is my favorite All You Can Eat sushi place! Their sushi is always fresh and their AYCE menu includes dessert as well!
Sushimon and Goyemon, but moreso Goyemon due to distance, have been my go-to places for AYCE sushi. There's never a trip to Vegas where I have not stopped by to dine, even during business trips to Vegas. However, at this last visit, I've became very disappointed by foremost the quality of the fish and secondly with the service.. . Every non-nigiri item came out first -- the appetizers and regular rolls. We sat for quite a while waiting for even just one of our nigiri orders. Sadly, the long wait wasn't rewarded at the end.. . Halibut nigiri... stringy and chewy. Had to spit out part of it because I really couldn't swallow it.. . Scallop...lots of lemon juice. Did not seem fresh.. . Cajun albacore...completely doused in sauce.. . 1/3 of the nigiri fish were smaller than before, which made it seem like there was too much rice given.. . At least the snow crab meat is still good, so we loaded up on multiple orders of that. Seeing that this may be my last trip to Goyemon (will likely go back to Sushimon), I also ordered my usual 2 orders of green tea ice cream and 2 orders of lychee sherbet, while getting the tempura ice cream just for kicks (the tempura batter gets to you at the second quarter piece you eat).. . I'm sad that I will likely not return, unless things change, and I hope that the diminishing quality didn't hit Sushimon as well.
Hands down the best sushi I have ever had. . . My boyfriend and I drive from SLC so you know it's worth it. We opt for the dinner all you can eat. We tend to order more nigiri pieces than rolls. . . If you go in a larger group, order a set of nigiri first. Then, order sushi rolls. Don't order too much at once or it will take forever to get your food. . . The dessert is also so good. I love the lychee sorbet, mochi, and the green tea creme brulee. . . We always make a stop here whenever we're in Vegas. ALWAYS.
My sister, who is a bigger foodie but doesn't write, lives out here and was the food and beverage manager for Ritz Carlton in D.C. so she knows her stuff. I recommended this place considering the # of reviews and 4 stars on Yelp. However, although I didn't try the food, I wanted to leave this dirty smelling joint asap. The place smelled like old fish, was dark, loud, and very crowded. Because I was so hungry, we left and went to her usual spot Umiya. Considering these places are all you can eat raw sushi joints, I'd rather be a bit more picky and eat at a more cleaner establishment. Even if it was the late lunch hour rush, the establishment should be clean and not smell like the kitchen if they're serving raw fish (my pet peeve). Dahmmit...I feel terrible for writing a bad review about this joint, but Umiya was just that much better and even a few bucks cheaper with the free drinks.
No sashimi all rolls. not as fresh. They want you to eat every piece of rice. Overpriced. Long wait. Not worth the  time and money and not too many selections. Never coming back!!!
I won't go too in depth because pretty much everything that needs to be said has already been said.. . - IMPORTANT: the dinner menu has a slightly bigger selection, most importantly pork belly, one order of sweet shrimp (amaebi) per person, and one order of sea urchin (uni) per person.. - service can sometimes be a pain, especially if you have a large group, you will be seated in a private room on the right with two large tables and have difficulty attracting the attention of your server. - TIP: in a group, don't order too much at once or else it will definitely take longer to get your food (i.e. 20 orders of nigiri per person in a party of 6). - nigiri: garlic tuna, salmon, cajun albacore are staples, and their uni is also great. - rolls: to each their own, but beware the 9-1-1 IS pretty spicy. - no matter how full you are or how full you think you are, you'll have space for dessert. lychee sherbet is my personal favorite. - there are a bunch of AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas, but I always end up gravitating back to Goyemon. . The only downsides are service and lengthy wait. Whatever. Goyemon is undoubtedly the best AYCE sushi in Vegas.
I was never a fan of AYCE sushi. Even after reading the good reviews about this place, I still wasn't interested in coming here since I already had a favorite sushi spot! However, we had family in town a few weeks ago who asked us to bring them here, so I finally got to see what it was all about. So many reviews here already, so I'll try to keep mine short and sweet. . . A few things I would like to point out...... First, we got lucky with the wait time. They told us we would be waiting about 40 minutes. But because a big party left, it opened up like 3 tables and we only waited about 20 minutes. I thought it was kind of cool that they text you a link that shows your place in line and how long you have waited so far to keep track of your time.. . Second, we unfortunately got a table that was close to the entrance door. It was so crowded and people were waiting inside the narrow entrance way (as if this place isn't tiny enough). I got annoyed because it felt like the whole time, strangers were watching me eat. Sorry, but it sucks when you cant enjoy your meal because people keep looking over your shoulder!. . Lastly, I'm sorry, but the sushi just wasn't that great. I ordered a few rolls, but nothing stood out or gave me a reason to come back again. They may have sounded fancy on the menu, but the taste was disappointing. However, I will say this. Their rice to meat/fish/veggies/what have you is great. They don't pack on the rice or are not stingy with the other ingredients, which some sushi places definitely do. . . Anyway, glad I finally tried it, but no thank you. I don't mind paying more for sushi that I can definitely enjoy elsewhere!
I am usually the pickiest sushi eater, so AYCE is not generally my choice.  But this place could definitely change my opinion!. . We were seated immediately at the bar at lunchtime on a weekday.  Our drink orders and appetizer orders were taken immediately, and as soon as the sushi chef in front of us had a breather, we placed our sushi orders.  We ate a lot of food, but these were the highlights:. . Sushi:. White Tuna sushi. Albacore sushi. Freshwater Eel sushi. . Appetizers:. Fried Calamari. Fried Soft Shell Crab. Tuna Poke. Octopus Poke. Dynamite. . Dessert:. Tempura fried ice cream. Lychee sorbet. . The appetizers that came from the kitchen are all sized very small, which is great because you can taste them and if you like them, order more.  . . The only downside was that they don't offer Uni at lunchtime, and at dinnertime they limit you to one order per person : (.  But the fact that they include desserts with their AYCE is pretty great!  . . For about $50 for 2 people, this was a great deal, and really hit the spot when we were craving sushi!
This place is one of the reasons why I go to Vegas!!. For $26.95, you can eat the BEST AYCE sushi dinner in Vegas.. It is a short drive from the strip, but way more worth it than other overpriced restaurants on the strip.. . I highly recommend getting their fresh nigiri, but if you are in a big group, make sure to order reasonable amounts at a time since ordering too much at once will slow down your order significantly. Their rolls are very good too to go well with the nigiri. You WILL feel VERY VERY full after eating lots of exceptional sushi, but everyone has a second stomach for deserts, right? Their lychee sorbet will cleanse your palates as well as make your day better.. This is a MUST stop for any Vegas trips
