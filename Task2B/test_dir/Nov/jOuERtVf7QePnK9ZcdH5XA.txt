Awesome. Is the one word I would use to describe this place, over many years of coming to vegas I've always found my way to the Grand Lux Venetian and I have never been disappointed.  The food, service, quality and serving sizes are all awesome.  I don't recommend the Palazzo location, been there once and won't go back.  The service was quite the opposite from the venetian.
I don't know why they have 2 Grand Lux's so close to each other, but I am a fan either way. Grand Lux is similar cheesecake factory. The portions are very big and good for splitting. I would recommend their chicken parm, which can definitely feed 2. I see gigantic waffles piled high with whipped cream coming out of the kitchen all the time. For desert they have an excellent chocolate and vanilla creme brulee. Their beignets are very good as well with their accompanying dipping sauces.
Very reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory but supposedly more refined. Well, I was disappointed in the flavors and technique as Vegas is supposed to known for culinary talent as well as night life. My crab crabs were fried extra crispy, leaving the crab meat dry. The spring rolls tasted odd until dipped in the sauce provided (I don't like my entire flavor to come from an added sauce) and they were not as crisp as I am accustomed. The pot pie filling was wonderful though. The crust a different story though, definitely flaky but dryas the surrounding desserts. I won't try this place again.
This place gets a five for bang for the buck and quality on the strip. Looks can be deceiving- it's not a tiny cafe out front! This place is a MASSIVE restaurant masked on the other side of the casino wall. I was nicely surprised that this place did not suck, considering its affordability for the Strip. Entrees are the size and price of a Cheesecake Factory, which makes sense as another reviewer noted that Cheesecake Factory owns this place.. . The menu is catastrophically large...like a Cheesecake Factory... Good idea to there with a general idea of what you want, lest you end up convincing yourself you need a salad, app, and triple-sized portion of an entree. Oh my sweet baby Jesus. O_o. . I had the Pasta Telefono, which was a MASSIVE portion of the cheesiest tomato pasta you've never seen in your life. I'm not sure if there was more sauce or cheese in this. Good, but you could easily split this dish 3 ways and have everyone be full still.. . My friend had the salmon three ways and liked it a lot. For the price tag, it's still a little high for what you get compared to everything else on the menu, but let's face facts... a pound of pasta is probably 50 cents wholesale value compared to 9 ounces of fish.. . The bread here is one of my favorite parts. The crust is perfectly crunchy and with a nice salted butter. Addictive. In fact, not a bad move if you want to share an entree and just eat bread. (But tip the server big, you know?). . Service was fantastic, and the restaurant itself is so beautiful. I would definitely go back when staying on the Strip.
I really appreciate restaurants that are open 24/7 in Vegas.  So I was very glad to see that the Venetian had the Grand Lux Cafe inside their hotel.  My friend and I were pretty hungry so we went with the Grilled Steak Sandwich and the Avocado-Chipotle Cheeseburger.  Both came with fries and coupled with their yummy complimentary bread, the food was more than enough to fill us up.. . I really enjoyed my steak sandwich.  The meat was very juicy and tender, while the arugula and tomatoes gave the sandwich a refreshing quality.  My friend completely took down his cheeseburger so I know he enjoyed it.  Also the complimentary bread they started us off with was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  Served with soft butter, it was a pleasant addition to our overall meal.  I would definitely eat here again.
Mygoodness, I must say this was the best breakfast of my life. Went to vegas to celebrate my 21st and turnt all the way up. My girlfriend and I had a blast. After two days of nonstop turning up and having a winning streak we can here to relax. The biscuits and gravy was the best I ever had. My girlfriend is Mexican and she's had chillaquilles from all over the place and admitted this was the best. After we left our winning streak became a losing streak, but we left vegas happy from this amazing breakfast.
We ate here daily during our week long stay at the Venetian. Every thing we are was great, (except for the pancakes-too thick for my liking, but tasty nonetheless) we never tried the buffet for breakfast because the huevos rancheros and chilaquiles were spicy good. Delicious waffles and lightly breaded chicken.. Great salads at lunch and the crispy buffalo sandwich looked great as well as the fish and chips. . Dinner was so flavorful. We tried the chicken Revello and it was fantastic. Very good cocktails here, as well. You cannot go wrong with your dining here. And the prices are relatively reasonable compared to some of the other restaurants in the Venetian, especially at dinner time. . EAT HERE! You won't be sorry.
Back in the day when I lived in Vegas this was the go-to late night dining spot. Their late night menu has plenty of variety and everything is always good. Now whenever I'm in town I usually find myself there. Staff is consistently good. This visit, the kitchen even made my favorite flatbread chicken sandwich even though it wasn't included on the late night menu. Ranch is amazing. My husband had the chicken and waffles and says it was the best he'd ever tasted and a friend's corned beef hash was delicious! Thank you for feeding my belly on hungry Vegas nights!
BASED ON BREAKFAST TO-GO:. . First of all, can we give a shout out to all joints that serve their breakfast menu all day? *applause* Already started off with 1 star.. . 2nd star came when we found out we could order to-go & it would be ready to pick up in 20 minutes, smack dab in the middle of their morning rush. *High-five Lux!*. . 3rd star came when we picked up our order off to the side of the entrance where the bakery is and they conveniently had other items like baked goods and all different kinds of drinks. I see you, Lux. I see you!. . 4th star came when I bit into that scrumptious breakfast sammich. That bad boy was huge! I thought I had ordered two of them or something. But don't me wrong, I still devoured that sucker, it just took me a little longer. Only thing is that I wish they put a tiny bit more effort into their hash browns. Mine were kinda bland and barely crispy. Another off note: we ordered ranch over the phone, when we picked up we also confirmed if they packed the ranch (they said they did), but when we got back to our room, no ranch to be seen. Bummer cause ranch is my boo boo. Not cool, but it happens.. . Something to note- I'm not sure of its connection to The Cheesecake Factory: It used to be one? It's owned by the same company? Not sure but it definitely had the same vibe and I love me some CF so I ain't mad at it!. . I would definitely come back!
Food was super delicious!!! But the services sucked. Took 15 min them to bring back my coffee and 20 min to get the bill.
My Wife and I went here and it was amazing. My Queen ordered the Miso Salmon and I ordered the Chicken and Waffles.  Both were great filling and flavorful.  We were both beyond full. The waffle was light and flaky th he chicken tenders were crispy. The salmon was cooked to perfection. . . We went back the next day because my Wife wanted thw the chicken and waffles and I ordered a burger. Both again were great!. . This chain is owned by Cheesecake Factory.  The service and food were the same in the Palazzo and the Venetian locations. . . Would definitely recommend and go back again. I enjoyed the food, service,  etc...
These are my favorite coffee shops in Las Vegas.  The restaurants are clean, spacious and have an ambiance you can't beat.  The menu is extensive and the food is prepared like you're at a gourmet restaurant.  The pasta dishes are amazing, the meat dishes delightful and your appetizers, soups and salads are way above average.  Service is great, but sometimes spotty, but the portions make up for this slight defect.  Go hungry and expect a better meal than at the Cheesecake Factory.
No idea how this place has four stars.  The service is super slow.  I had the opportunity to meet clients here twice during my trip to Vegas.  Both times it took over 30 minutes to be seated, another 10 to have the order taken and another 20 to be served.  This was at 6:30 in the morning.  The food is diner food.  Nothing to write home about or make this place a destination.  I do give them kudos for some of the best orange juice, but for $4 per glass it had better be.
Great menu. The food and service were excellent . This is a nice spot to take a break and eat some good food
One of my favorites. Pre game dinner prior to kick off ASU vs Oregon State at the Sports Book Venetian Resort and Casino. PRETTY COOL.
Although very busy with a convention in town we got seated quickly and served soon after.. . Bistro steak - 4 oz of tender beef with a simple flavored polenta that complemented the beef. The Brussel sprouts that were with the meal were just the shavings of the outside layer without the meat of the whole veggie. Overall a satisfying meal.. . Chicken pot pie - a large portion ( could share with another person ). The inside of the pot pie must have a white wine base with the layers of flavors. The inside of the pot pie was almost like a savory chicken stew with big chunks of moist chicken, potatoes and veggies. The flaky topping was also an enjoyable experience for the taste buds.
There's a waitress there who's shady as fuck. We paid tax and tip, then she claimed we didn't and made us pay for tax again. We were too tired to fight it even more than we did so we just paid. Such a shame bc I really liked this place but don't like to be treated like shiiiiiiiiit
Large Portions, B+ Service. Clean.  Extensive Menu but ultimately underwhelming hotel  food.   Good if you are staying at the hotel but not a destination.
Gone are the days when food in vegas use to be cheap.  Now restaurants from celebrity chefs are all over the place and a typical meal at one of these places is going to set you back $40-$50 bucks.  Whats great about the grand lux is that prices are reasonable, most dishes running about $15-$20 dollars, good food and good service.  At my last visit to the restaurant, I got the Memphis ribs, lunch portion.  It came with about 8 bones, a side of coleslaw and jalepeno cornbread. The ribs were nice and tender and the bbq sauce wasn't too sweat.  My friend had a problem with his order, he ordered a kobe burger and the waitress brought out kobe meatballs.  Manager came over to apologize for the mix up and offered him a cup of soup while he waited for his food since the rest of out food came out.  Unfortunately since they tried to rush the burger, the burger came out well done when my friend ordered med well.  When the bill came the waitress mentioned that they didn't charge us for the burger due to the mixup.  Mistakes happen, so we were not upset, and the manager did what he could to rectify the situation.
While our orders took a while, it was nice to see what people ordered. I wanted to get something extra special and when I saw the Grand Lux Cafe French toast which is made of EXTRA thick slices of Brioche Bread, I knew I had to get it. The toast is so massive that the waiter even had to ask me if the size of the French toast was okay. I thought that was rather odd but I happily said I was okay with that. Helloooo, more food the better because that means leftovers!. The cappuccino was disappointing. It was bubbly, not foamy.
It is so great here!! I had the Zen Noodles,  (rice noodles, sliced chicken, onion garnish in the soup and on the side they put spinach, cilantro, jalapenos, and bean sprouts) and it is soooo good! . . I was helped by Michael Angelo (he said this to me that's why I put the full name), and he was a really good server. I was also seated very quickly and the hostess was very nice and held the chair out for me! The food came out quickly as well.. . A definite must and I recommend to everyone!!!
I ordered a "Sunday Night Pasta" (meat sauce simmered with short ribs, steak, mushroom, short ribs, onion, garlic, Parmesan served over. Spaghettini). The sauce was tasty and the portion very generous.. . I also had a piece of my friends "Double stuffed Potato spring rolls" - spring roll wrapper filled with mashed potato and bacon, cheddar and green onion. These were delicious - crispy and cheesy.. . Overall I found the food good value and tasty. The spring rolls were a definite winner and I will be back for these.
I do recommend the Greek salad and Sunday night pasta. The Short Rib Grilled cheese sandwich was an average and the fries was cold.. . The service is excellent.
