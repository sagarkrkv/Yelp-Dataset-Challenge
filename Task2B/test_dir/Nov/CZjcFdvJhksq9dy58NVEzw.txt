Dinner was Good but wasn't as great as expected. However breakfast/lunch is a lot better! Free drinks ( soft drinks, juices, coffee and tea) and $12 unlimited alcohol package available. Staff is very rude and unorganised however waiters are friendly but very few, so do mind then running around past you a lot trying to do a 5 man job on their own.
We went for Sunday Brunch and added on the All You Can Drink option. They had a large variety in there food; salad bar, carving station, sushi bar, pasta bar, pizza bar and everything breakfast. .      * There Prime Rib was delicious (ask for it cooked to your liking). .      Bartenders/Servers Jimmy and William were awesome!! They were quick with the All You Can Drink turn-around time. The service and care that they gave to us was impeccable. .      We will definitely being going back soon. Probably for Thanksgiving Brunch.
Awesome buffet!  Loved it!  They had lots of seafood items. Very nice friendly people.
On a hot April afternoon during our stay at Bellagio, we decided to try out their famed buffet.. The buffet was quite good, though we felt it was pricey at $40-ish + taxes, and that too because it was a weekday lunch, heard its much higher over the weekends. But then it's Vegas, so you can't expect value for money I guess :) . Coming to the food, there was a huge array of dishes, and my wife who is a vegetarian also found many good options in it. It was mostly an international mix, with something to satisfy every palate.. The service was ok-ish, and at times we found the servers looking disinterested.. . To sum up, while in Vegas you can definitely experience this buffet once, probably before or after watching the spectacular fountains :)
The Buffet at the Bellagio was the best and left my buttons bursting by the end of my meal!  I visited this location on a Monday night and paid $34 to partake in the mountainous piles of seafood, pasta, salad, soups, meats, and international fare offered here.  There was no line and I was excited to dive in as soon as possible.  Buffets are a great place to try foods that I wouldn't normally try or order at most other sit-down restaurants.. . I started by piling my plate high with King Crab legs.  Having never tried these before, I now understand why the fisherman on Deadliest Catch go to such lengths to catch them.  Wow!  This was a fantastic opportunity to fill up on an item that I will likely not have again for some time.  I also very much enjoyed the Kobe Beef, shrimp, roasted fingerling potatoes, and so much more!  I would love to list off everything that I ate but in complete honesty... I can't for the life of me remember nor picture each plate that I brought back to the table.  . . As a girl with a sweet tooth, I was ecstatic to discover the number of options I had at the dessert bar.  What I liked most about it were the very small portions served.  I grabbed a big plate and brought 4 or so small desserts back with me to sample each.  As I circled around my plate of goodies, I couldn't believe how delicious one dessert was compared to the next.  Cheesecake, cappuccino mousse, rich chocolate bubbles, and nutella tarts were swimming across my vision and eventually in my belly.. . In addition to the excellent options and flavorful food, the service here was equally impressive.  Our waiter was very quick to clear our plates and refill our drinks with each departure.  Considering my date and I were barely at the table at the same time,  going up for food whenever our plates happened to empty, this was a difficult feat to complete.  When my napkin appeared even slightly soiled from some stray cocktail sauce, a fresh one showed up.  New silverware even appeared during my time there.  Fantastic!. . My only regret is not trying this place out earlier in the trip.... so that I had the opportunity to return.  I think the price was more than fair for the options and quality of food served here.  I would definitely return to this location if in Vegas again!
Food is delicious, but the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing when it comes to seating people. They seem confused. However, the chefs know exactly what they're doing. When I do a buffet, I normally go to the M Resort Buffet and the Bacchanal Buffet. To me, Bellagio's buffet was just as good.
1. Verdict/Value: One of the mid to better options on the Strip - enjoy on a weekday for lower pricing!  Steve Wynn fans should really enjoy the buffet at The Wynn instead of this one for better food quality and selection.. . 2. Food: $33.99 for dinner during the weekday, it offers a fair range of good quality options over a number of other buffets on the Strip.  Salads, pasta, carving stations, food of various ethnicities and cuisines await you before the selection of soft serve ice cream and mini desserts call your name.. . 3. Service: It's a buffet, so expectations are low; the server we had did a good job in making sure our beverages were always full.. . 4. Atmosphere: with decor matching the rest of the casino, it's clean, pleasant, and bright enough to know what's underneath the tables.  Hungry and/or those wanting a more contemporary environmentshould ask for one of the four-seat cherry-wood tables near the buffet.
We came for Weekend brunch which was pretty good though inferior to the other ones in Vegas I've been to this year (Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon, and Mozen ... yes I'm always uncomfortably full when I board the plane back home). . To be fair, it is also cheaper than the ones I've named at 29.99 for regular brunch Saturday and Sunday. BUT we realized the next day they had charged us the champagne brunch price of $41.99 without anyone offering us champagne!!! Grrrr. . The selection is fairly standard. The highlights included their pesto mashed potatoes, and their thin pizza selection which includes a delicious pesto shrimp. The fiancee enjoyed his prime ribs a lot, but the seafood selection and quality was unimpressive. The desserts were fairly good, though I prefer the gelato stations at Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon). . The ambience and decor is fairly casual- the seating area makes me feel like I'm at a diner instead of in the Bellagio.
the food is not too great . staff -poor service . nothing beats the Baccanal buffet at Caesar's Palace
So, after reading a few reviews the wife and I decided to Go the The Buffet ...and drum roll please.,.!??!?!!..... It's was Okay good food but there were a few hiccups ..I say this because the food was good but when it's came down to the main event the Crab Legs ( isn't this where we get our monies worth?!? . ) it's wAs a complete FAIL......so after slipping in on the tail end of lunch we decided to stick around to see what dinner had to offer...The flank steak is a MUST have and the mashed potatoes are really good too...now on to the bad part:::: the Crab Legs ...BEWARE they are cold/frozen...now you can have them heated but the line is so long it's rather discouraging ....now I'm not sure about you but I Need butter..and After waiting 25mins for some to become available I almost sat my plate of now  Cold crab legs down and called it a day. The butter finally arrived ...but i was disappointed when I took the first taste ...bland /cold ..and lackluster crab...nice try..even the butter had no taste ..everything else was pretty standard..glad we got the lunch price
No doubt the best buffet in Vegas!! We were there from 10am-12pm. Started out with breakfast and ended with lunch. Amazing food and our server was fantastic! Add on for the unlimited champagne is necessary! Highly recommended if you are visiting Vegas.
I have always heard how good the buffet was at the Bellagio hotel so I decided to try it. Maybe I was expecting too much but I was very disappointed!! They do have a large selection of food but the quality is below average. They did not even have their famous crab legs !! The sushi was horrible, the dishes did not have much flavor . I think the best part of the Buffett was the salad bar.. As long as it was not cooked it was fine.
We ate the dinner buffet here about an hour before closing. I was not impressed with the quality of the food for the price. The only thing really noteworthy were the desserts. Perhaps lunch is a better option. I would not return again for dinner though.
So far had dinner on a Friday and Saturday brunch. . . On Friday food was excellent, service a bit slow but place is huge. My biggest gripe is quality of food for price on Saturday. They reheated some of food on Saturday from Friday. Specifically pasta with marinara sauce. . . . . Also allot of the buffets welcome the 30,000 runners and families with some type of discount. Bellegio is not having any of that. Price is 60 for 2. . . Would recommend to visit craving at mirage for a 50% discount for rest of weekend. Also  a pro-tip maybe send the hostess at the front to some pr training, she acts like she's working at a dmv. Brash and ready to pounce not what I expected from such a beautiful property.
Save yourself money and time by going to the Rio instead. The Rio's about half the price and the line outside moves quicker. This buffet was a massive let down. I'm a local and brought my mom there for birthday. $32 per person is fine when the food is good. Not the case. Servers were great but nothing could save the food :(
I'd actually go with 3.5 stars if I could, but for once, I am glad I can't because it wouldn't be fair to the business.  Here's the thing - my girlfriend and I had just finished the rock n roll half marathon and wanted to eat.  Our original plans were to grab 1 buffet this weekend, and it was not going to be this one.  Unfortunately, the one we wanted to go to was closing by the time the race ended (we were planning on going a couple days prior, but circumstances required us to skip it).  Therefore, we were trying to decide between the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars, or this one.  We chose this one because although we loved the one at Caesars when we were last in Vegas, we wanted to try a new one.  Therefore, we came here.  However, we realized after we paid that we had been here before (we didn't remember going to 2 buffets our last trip) and therefore, should have gone to Caesars, which we preferred, but it was too late.  Therefore, I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have because I was disappointed in the decision to come here in the first place.. . As I said, that's not really fair though because the Bellagio has a really good buffet.  Is it as good as Caesars?  Nope, but it has plenty of options and it's all high quality and very tasty.  It's funny, but you are actually not that starving after a long distance run.  I thought I would be, but until your muscles relax, everything is so tight that you can't eat as much.  Therefore, I wasn't able to eat as much as I wanted to.  Nevertheless, I did enjoy one plate full of carved turkey, rotisserie chicken, carved ham, kobe beef, and some potatoes.  Also had another plate of some Asian food and crab legs, and finally, 2 bowls of won ton soup, which was probably the best item (sooooooooooo deliciously salty!).. . If I had to complain about something - and lets face it, if you know me, then you know I have to complain about a lot of things - it would be the dessert.  Firstly, no cookies?  How do you not have trays of cookies?  Secondly, a lot of the desserts were just disappointing.  No apple pie or cobbler, only 1 or 2 cheesecake options, no brownies.  They did have mini key lime pies, so there was that, and they also had ice cream, but it was 35 degrees out, so screw that.. . Also, the buffet at Caesars serves things in little tapas plates.  So rather than you heaping loads of food you won't finish onto your plate, Caesar's controls the portions.  You can always grab more than one, or go back for more, but if I had to wager, I would say that Caesar's system wastes less food.  If you give me two buffets, and I can eat as much as I want - to the point of bursting and making a disgusting mess - at both, and both serve high quality delicious food, but one wastes less, then I'll go with that one.  Also, if I am being honest, Caesar's has better options, too.. . But, just because Caesar's is better doesn't mean Bellagio is bad.  Heck, go to both.  Apparently, I did, but I ate so much I broke my memory.
This buffet is just ordinary compared to the other ones out there. Nothing special at all. So many other good places to eat, I wouldnt waste a meal here.
Four words: Alaskan King Crab Legs. . Nuff said.  Pre-split, unlimited, and served with hot butter, I really didn't waste my time eating much else here.  Ask one of the workers to heat your crab legs (iced on the buffet line) in hot water before enjoying!. . Like all other Vegas buffets, the spread was pretty decent with a full sushi station featuring make-your-own hand rolls, a full salad bar, a carvingstation with prime rib and steak (which was overdone), a soft serve machine, and a wide array of mini desserts.  Good quality, and all for about $35 on a Thursday night.  Win!. . Ambiance was a bit nicer than most Vegas buffets, and they didn't charge us extra when we ordered illy coffee and hot chocolate.. . Tip: Dine before 6 to avoid massive lines!
There was a time--back in the 1990's that the Bellagio Buffet was on top--a must visit when in Vegas.  I craved it.  The bronze and silver shined, the service was filled with energy and excitement, and the food--extraordinary.  I remember sitting down and just polishing off lots of carp and lox and salmon.  . . But those days are no more--and they have gone been since the crash of the economy in 2008--this Buffet has never come back.. . On my last visit, which will be my last--the bronze and silver was worn and did not shine, the service was dull and angry, and the food mediocre.  Gone was the great quality Lox and Carp and Salmon.  It reminded me of a Buffet that was headed toward Circus Circus level.  . . But people keep lining up--because it's 1990's strong reputation lives on with people that never experienced how great it used to be.  They accept mediocrity because they never knew superiority.  Chicago Grandma tells her 20 something grandkids, "don't forget to check out the Bellagio Buffet, it's the best in Vegas..."  But grandma has not been there since Millenium New Years Eve in 1999.  . . There are others that have those great memories of the 1990's at this Buffet, know that it is no more, but keeping checking-in hoping that it comes back, only to leave disappointmented. . . This buffet has no incentive to improve because people line up like cattle for the slaughter not knowing any better--just what they heard.  And if they can keep filling the seats without improving--it's a cash cow for the casino--it may make more money than some of the tables many nights.  . . It's depressing to see what it has become.. . You're meal here will be OK, you will walk away full and satisfied--but there is much better for your dining dollar folks I hate to tell you.
I went there for brunch on Saturday with my dad and sister. Paid $33 for each of us. Food was okay, nothing to complain or brag about but did not feel especial. Environment and service  were nice though. Took off 1 star for price.
Lack of variety, theres shrimp, beef and thats it.. . No salmon, king crabs, or any of that stuff needed for a good buffet.. . Rather pay 15 more dlls and have the real buffet experience. Woulndt come back here.
I didn't like the decoration but the food was super tasty. Very good place for family's .. Great international selection. Amazing desserts.. I totally recommend . Satisfaction guaranty with a reasonable price.
The Buffet at Bellagio is still one of the top contender buffet champion! Since the poor recession, a lot of the once great buffet places has find ways to skimp back on the food quality to stay in business! Before when I came to Vegas on vacation. The first thing I do is to sample all the great buffets LV has to offer. But now I only eat at a select few just to be safe. Don't want to call in sick from food poisoning after getting back from a vacation. Won't look good on future resume. Anyway! The food quality is still amazingly fresh and delicious. Customer services are excellent! Employees look happy and courteous to serve you. That's why I usually leave tips. Don't be cheap thinking you are not getting good service at a buffet. Some of the nicest servers or bussers I met at a buffet are much more professional than the ones at a five star restaurant, and you don't have to tip them like Donald Trump! So if buffet is your thing and you don't want to break your bank going to the more expensive buffets like Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal. Then The Buffet at Bellagio is your place. They have great selections like cracked or half-split Alaskan crab legs and sea bass. Great dessert and cheese selections. And they still honor the trick I learn from LV locals, go half an hour before dinner time and pay the lunch price to get dinner meal. Most buffets in LV has caught on or got cheap and stop serving between each meals. Some even have the nerve to tell you that they need to charge you dinner price because they are serving dinner soon. LV is still one of the top vacation spot I go to often to get world quality treatment! So please support the American economy by shopping and eating locally!
Was a pretty satisfying buffet due to the coupon I had. Salmon, salmon poke, the prime rib, desserts, and crab legs were pretty good. Staff were very easy going and friendly would return here to eat again
Let s start with the food, not much of a variety, like any regular Buffet but you have to pay $35 for it!! Waiting time was almost for one hour standing on my feet!!. Don t throw your money on it while you can go to Bacchanal buffet at Caesars and enjoy every bite for the same money.. Bad experience.
WARNING Thanksgiving Brunch Diners. Only 18 of the 62 dishes that appear on the Bellagio Buffet Thanksgiving menu were served today at brunch. Huge disappointment this was our worst thanksgiving day meal ever. To make it worse, Items were not served hot & lacked flavor, wait staff was unsmiling at both table side and food stations. Save your money and the long wait. We had Campbell's tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner tonight & enjoyed it more.
Delicious! I will definitely return to this buffet. The dessert and food selection were perfect.
Spent 45mins in line and huge disappointment... . -Low quality food, their meats (pork roast/ prime rib) aren't good at all as they are all dried and hard and overcooked .. -unworthy price, this buffet costs $37.99. Also +13% of tips with 8 people or more . -food choice = bad. As a sushi lover, I was looking for some raw fishes or fish sushi. But they only have vegetable sushi and smoked salmon!! . Also, they have weird desserts and soup (carrot cake, pumpkin cake, some kind of nuts soup==). . . By being nice, this restaurant worth 2 stars because their service. Some of the staff's attitude are good
