Loved this place!. . Service was great: friendly and quick. The food was delicious and artfully arranged. Ambiance was trendy.. . The food is a little expensive for a casual night out, and I would not recommend coming here if you want a quiet, intimate date. But otherwise had a great time and will return.
Food:  Good. We got the famous chopped salad for an appetizer to share, the pork chop and the scallops.  The 'famous' chopped salad was really quite good and a nice twist on a something of a staple.  Really liked the presentation before it was mixed... not as pretty after they mix it, but tasted great.  The pork chop was a bit dry and overcooked, but the portion was healthy and the sides were quite good.  The scallops were extremely well done, and the mix of flavors in this main was really good.  Serving size was on the smaller side.. . Ambiance:  Really very nice. We arrived early for dinner and had the restaurant largely to ourselves until near the end.  Very nice furniture, setting, etc.  Good music (blues) that went well with their overall theme.  People showed up on all types of attire, but I'd suggest business casual type attire to avoid feeling under-dressed.. . Service:  Really very good.  They remembered that we had a show to get to and were very conscious of getting us out and to the show on time.  The waitress was attentive, pleasant, and had good suggestions.   They were finishing up preparing for the dinner rush during out meal and the bits and pieces we overheard, the attention to detail was really quite impressive and more than we expected.. . Prices:  Considering the neighborhood, etc. not horrible, but not cheap.  $100 for 2 drinks, an appetizer and two mains.  I'd say the $$ rating is off...it should be $$$.  I'd be impressed if you escape for less than ~$35/person and I'd bet that is an uncommon occurrence.. . Tip:  You really need to try the chopped salad... it really does deserve the hype.. . Net:  Great place for a night out if you're going to hang in Scottsdale for the evening or first date (trying to make a good first impression).  For the price, the portions needto be a bit bigger and consistently excellent to hit 5 stars, but a solid 4 IMO.
pork belly pastrami (4/5): This was pretty good, but I find the dish a tad too greasy. The sauerkraut's acidity sort of took down the grease down a notch but I still find it a bit too much for me. Which was weird because I usually love fatty pork belly.. . Original chopped salad (5/5): This was the perfect salad. The flavor, the texture, and the freshness of the ingredients, everything was perfect. I think it had salmon in it as well, which imo was the perfect protein to go with this salad.. . Seared scallops (3/5): The scallops were cooked perfectly, but it was over seasoned. In addition, they garnished the scallops with bacons, which added more saltiness. I also didn't like the glaze because it was too sweet (I believe it was coke and red-wine reduction?). . Taste alone I think this place is worthy of a 3.5-3.8. However, I find the food a bit too pricey (came out to be $43 per person) so I'm giving it a 3-star.
It was nice. Not too over the top in pricing. Cool atmosphere. Food was fantastic as well. Will definately go back.
I love love love this place! We went with a rather large group and the server really took care of us. The food was amazing, you must try the pretzel fondue! My husband and I split the meatloaf, again, amazing!  It's such a fun atmosphere for large groups or even a date night! There was a guy singing solo, but was great. Very social setting and great people watching. Highly recommend!!!
5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the service, 1 star for the inability to hear yourself think due to the loudness of the music and the terrible acoustics in this place.. . We met some out-of-town relatives at CPH last night and were hoping to have a really good meal and catch-up conversation...but all we got was the really good meal.  The pork belly pastrami appetizer was superb, the entrees of pan-seared scallops, meatloaf and pork chop were amazing and the bread pudding for dessert was to-die-for.  So, absolutely no issues with the food.. . But the noise level was ridiculous, even for a night-life kind of place.  We literally could not hear the person across the table.  Asked our waiter to turn the music off or at least down but his manager refused...so we had to scream at each for 2 hours.. . We will go back but without guests.  Go for the food/food service but don't go thinking you're going to have any relaxed conversation...at least not on a Friday night.
Food was amazing. Coming from Charleston, SC and eating different types of food, this by far was the best restaurant I've eaten at. Props to you citizen public house.
Oh man! Love their Sangria-- some of the best in town. And their dessert ain't to shabby either!  And... love the people watching.
I had a great meal here tonight with some colleagues. The service was great and food even better.  I had a Odell seasonal ale to start.  Great to see a awesome Colorado brewery on the list of beers.  That said, I would expect a stronger and bigger selection of beers for a restaurant categorized as a Gastropub. .   For dinner I had the scallops and they were amazing.  Desert we shared every option and the bacon and apple bread pudding was phenomenal.
Delicious and cozy!! Everything on the menu here is amazing! The happy hour menu has incredible deals you won't find anywhere else in Scottsdale!!! Decent beer selection, yummy cocktails, service is impeccable. One can never go wrong with the Chefs Special.
First, our server, A.J.,  was top notch and was a major reason for our group of golf buddies enjoying a great evening at CPH. He had knowledge of the food and great personality.  The cocktails and food were delicious.  The only negative comments I can say is that the crab cakes need a little work. But the chopped salad, the burrata, the short rib, the scallops, and the meatloaf were fantastic.. Great restaurant with lots of energy.
Made a reservation for MNO for 6 of us mamas.  When we arrived we had 2 people cancel and the hostess had no problems quickly rearranging the table set up for us.  We were quickly seated! Great start. . We ordered some cocktails.  I had their mule, refreshing with a little zap from the alcohol!  Perfect. . We started with some nibbles, the bacon popcorn and the chop salad to share at the table.  The chopped salad being their signature item did not disappoint! The bacon popcorn...who thinks of this stuff-totally delicious! . . I proceeded to order the short rib which honest to God was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth! (Food!!! Get your head outta the gutter man!!! :P) I couldn't stop eating it and the next thing you know it was gone and I was licking the plate and my belly was full and I was in my happy place! . . For dessert I don't remember what it was that we shared, but it was chocolatey and crunchy and creamy all at the same time - decadent and delicious!  . . I told my girlfriends that I can't wait to come back with the husband for a date night!    . . Bravo CPH...super crazy yumm!!!
This was my first time visiting the Citizen Public House, and have not yet decided if it is somewhere I'd go again. . . Upon entering, we were greeted at the hostess stand and taken to our seats. We were seated next to a fairly loud group (not uncommon for Scottsdale on a Saturday night) who seemed to be having a good time discussing the merits of whatever their latest business ventures were and whose volume was not increasing much so chose to keep our appointed table. . . The atmosphere of the restaurant was noisy and boisterous, and seemed to be filled with an interesting crowd of people. Half of them were a bit older and begrudgingly eating dinner out that evening and the other half were young  professionals. There was music playing overhead but it barely registered for most of the people there (one woman I overheard in the restroom was audibly surprised to hear it playing for the first time that evening.) The wait staff was incredibly attentive and pleasant-- the waiter introducing himself and shaking our hands was an interesting way to start off the meal. . . At our server's recommendation we started off with the Pastrami Pork Belly (for him) and the Original Chopped Salad (for me.) Both were very flavorful and the salad presentation was a fun twist. . . For an entree I selected the scallops, and he had the short ribs. My scallops were flavorful and well prepared, although the wilted baby kale which sat atop it was difficult to cut into in order to pair the two for a bite. The scallops were nested in a corn grit mix and the plate was drizzled with an interesting gastrique that was a little too sweet for my taste- I'm more of a vinegar fan. . . The short ribs were rubbed a little too generously with coffee with very little extra flavor to add to it; the dipping sauce which was provided to flavor it was a little too salty to enjoy with the meat. Accompanying was a parsnip puree that neither of us were excited about. We agreed the appetizers were the best portion of the meal. . . This seems like a great place to take a group of friends for apps and drinks to begin a fun night out in Downtown Scottsdale, but isn't really the type of place I'd recommend to anyone looking for a romantic and quiet dinner.
Always have the best experience when I eat here. For some reason Gary is always my server but he's fantastic! He always makes wonderful recommendation when I can't figure out to eat. Can't go wrong with anything...
Great food and the service was pretty quick as well.  We had a party of 10 and everyone enjoyed their meals and drinks.  Can't wait to go there again!!
Outstanding service and hands down the best salad I've ever tasted in my entire life.  In a momentary mental lapse I ordered something that wasn't on the menu and they actually delivered it!  I will always come back here when I am in Scottsdale!
I love this place for casual drinks or date night.  The drinks are perfectly done - strong but tasty (get the Manhattan OMG), and the food is worth the price.  Not huge portion sizes but you don't need to be overly stuffed because by the last bite you'll be satisfied thanks to the flavor.  I also enjoy the ambience - very classy but not stuffy.  I definitely will be going back CPH.
We came here on a Friday night with no reservation got seated right away. Very Friendly and helpful staff. They offer unique cocktails, beer, and barrel whiskey. I had the Citi-zen it has rock candy, I also had a Moscow mule. Has a ton of ginger which I like, not everyone does. . . I got the grilled cheese and added bacon. It was good, nothing special. It tasted like mashed potatoes more than cheese but hand me truffle anything and I'll eat it.. . He got the lamb burger he liked it but neither of us cared for the fries they were dry. . . I know they offer a more extensive dinner menu but we weren't looking to spend 30-35 on an entree I'd definitely go back but probably just for drinks and appetizers.
Went here with friend- dinner was excellent service was exceptional- would recommend- good looking crowd
Oh EM GEEEE, I absoluetly love Citizen! I have had so many dishes here and I love that they're open for late night dinning. The chopped salad is the best in the world!
