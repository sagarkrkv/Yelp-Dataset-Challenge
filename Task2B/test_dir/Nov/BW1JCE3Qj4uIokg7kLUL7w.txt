The worst service  I've ever had. I would have been upset about the service but the food was even worse. Do NOT go HERE. You will be sick with disappointment.
While on vacation in Las Vegas, Nevada, my family and Idecided to stop at Wolfgang Puck's restaurants at the MGM Grand for lunch. We didn't have reservations and still managed to be seated almost immediately upon arrival which was great! The staff was friendly and the ambience was relaxed and enjoyable. The restaurant wasn't too loud and the food was tasty. I had perfectly cooked Stripped Bass with roasted finger link potatoes and veggies with a glass of mojito. My kids had pizza and my husband had the Ricotta Gnocchi which he enjoyed. It was all delicious and I would definitely recommend it for anyone wanting a good meal at affordable prices inside the MGM.
Very good service and surprisingly easy to get in and be seated right away. Food was good and the service was excellent. The pasta dishes are fantastic and the white pizza was perfect. The drinks were a bit on the syrupy side but a minor gripe to an otherwise fantastic meal.
My FAVORITE restaurant that I tried during my trip here. . . My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday night for dinner before seeing KA (located right across the hallway from here). There was no wait for table, and the setting was very nice. I wore leggings and felt very underdressed, but not too out of place. . . Service was wonderful, and the food was excellent. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and my boyfriend got the linguine with shrimp. Everything was perfect, and probably the best pasta I've ever had. . . Drinks were very good, and I was super happy to finally get a Moscow Mule in a copper mug! Everywhere I ordered it from never had the copper mug, but Wolfgang Puck didn't disappoint. My boyfriend ordered a Manhattan, and it was perfect. A lot of other bars we've been to tend to use cherries and tons of ice instead of orange peel with just one block of ice, but the bartender did it the right way here. . . I would highly recommend this place to anyone. I think it beats a long buffet line with unsanitary people grabbing food with their hands from a hot tray any day.
For the price this is the best restaurant in the MGM and surrounding hotels. The fish and chips is ousts ding, and the service is spot on! Everyone is extremely friendly!!! I would highly recommend this place
For the prices and reputation, not impressed. Our food was tasty but not amazing. Nothing was hot, as they put the food to sit and wait on a marble countertop which cools the food way more than a different surface would such as wood. Won't return.
This was our 3rd choice while roaming MGM Grand looking for a sports bar to watch the football games. Unfortunately the 2 bars were packed and there was an hour wait. We were starved and need food STAT. Wolfgang Puck actually had a bar with a couple of TVs that were playing the football games. NICE!. . We were promptly seated at a table with a great view of the game. We were greeted immediately by our server and were offered the specials and a run through of the menu. . . We ordered a steak sandwich ($22), the Spaghettini ($20) and a draft Firestone Pale 31 to share ($8). The steak sandwich was flavorful and had a side of fries. The Spaghettini was simple and fresh. It could have used a little more salt or cheese, but otherwise very filling and loved the flavors.. . Great option to have a nice meal in MGM.
Went for lunch. The food was really good for the price. Vegas is super expensive ...Next time I'm in Vegas this will be my go to place...
Been here a couple of time on every stay at MGM. Food is ok. American food, burger, steak. Had the lasagna it was good. Service was ok.
My husband and I have made Wolfgang Puck at MGM our favorite place to eat each time we come to Vegas. We always stay at MGM.  And we eat at Wolfgang each night we are here. You couldn't ask for a better crew. They all are really the very best.. Being on first name basis with all of them makes your dining experience more personal with the feeling that they will see to it that you will have all that you desire for your meal.. I believe Jason is the top in management with JP and Jaimie seeing to it that the rest of the staff take care of your every need.. Josh is exceptional as your bartender, being very attentive to your needs. Edwin, your chef see's to it that every dish is as special as the last.. Christian, being your polisher makes sure that everything is polished above standard and very presentable.  Each of them always presents you with a smile and warm greeting. . And then there is the food, oh the yummy food. They offer many wonderful dishes, never to disappoint. I can't say enough great things about the food. You just have to go and experience it all as we have and I am sure that Wolfgang Puck will also become your favorite place to go to also.. Enjoy!
Lots of delicious options with a great space!. . I really like this restaurant for many reasons & it's a casual location with really great food. Its open to the casino floor & it has great energy. I've never ordered something I didn't enjoy & as for the decor goes it's surrounded by roses...I love it!. . Some of the dishes I recommend are the jidori chicken, chinois salad & all the pasta dishes! I'm a big fan! . . The service is always great!
Nice oasis if you want to get away from the "casino" experience for awhile.  It's all about the food and pleasant atmosphere, no machines at the bar, no keno updates in your face.  The food was tasty and served quickly.  One disappointment was the soup was served with out crackers...they don't have 'em.  Josh the bartender is easily one of the best on the strip, and there are a lot of bartenders on the strip. He is extremely friendly, and provides fast courteous service and makes you feel welcome.  (I had just lost a bundle & probably didn't tip him enough!  I'll get you next time Josh!!)  I had left my rewards card on the bar & Josh left his post & chased after me to be sure I got it!  Super nice of him and not many would have done that.  I'm glad he saved me 30 minutes in line to get another one!  I highly recommend the Apple cobbler, perfect portion size after a meal.
