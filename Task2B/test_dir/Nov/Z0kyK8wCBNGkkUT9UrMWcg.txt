Made reservations for a Thursday night dinner and didn't have to wait at all. All the food was fantastic. The service was also super. The VIP drink is very good. Tasted like fresh pineapples. Me and my friend shared the bone in rib eye. I thought it was a bit too fatty, but it was very tender and juicy. We also got the truffle and fois gras butter in the side to try. The truffle butter is sensational. Definitely try it. There is another mushroom butter the server recommended that I would like to try next time. . . We also ordered lots of appetizer. The best has to be the crab cakes. It was filled with chunks of crabs, hardly any fillers. The tuna tartar was okay, but the crunchy bread that went along with it goes very well with it. The Shanghai calamari was a bit too sweet for my tasting. . . Another friend ordered the jumbo crabs and it was very fresh, but nothing out of the ordinary. . . We also ordered the lemon cake to share with coffee. It was a huge piece. Even for four people we took half of it back with us. It is supposedly made freshly from scratch.
Ordered a steak medium well. I was told that meant "slightly pink".  Steak arrived bloody.  I asked if that looked "medium well" -waiter said " yes ".  Completely lost my appetite.  That and the sewer smell = NEVER COMING BACK.
This was my first time to Del Frisco's. My Boss said he had been to one in Chicago but never in Vegas so we took out our customers for a great steak dinner.. . When you walk in its very fancy and since it's the Double Eagle "golf term" they give away golf picks which is cool if you like golf stuff.. . We made a reservation via opentable for 8 people and it worked perfectly we were seated near that back there restaurant in a banquet room at this larger beautiful round table. Gorgeous place settingand decorations.. . Our waitress name was Carly I think I can't remember but I feel sorry for her because the group of guys we had at our table were crazy. We all were getting a little bit too rowdy for this type of place.  It was funny but a little nuts. Luckily she was really cool and hooked us up with great advice and our orders came out super quick. So that's a plus.. . We all started off with beer and wine and I had Jack on the rocks. Then we ordered Shrimp Remoulade and Crab Cakes. The shrimps were delicious because of that the wonderful heavenly sauce they had on them. The Crab cakes were also very good because of a lobster sauce that came with it. Then we ordered some Onion Rings Beer Battered, Thick Cut. These things were massive. It was the biggest onion rings I have ever seen/eaten. I really liked the onions flavor they were perfect and the crust outside was perfect as well.. . Then we moved on too the main course except I can't remember what everyone ordered but I think my Boss ordered the Filet Mignon 12 oz. and 3 other guys ordered that as well. They said it was cooked perfectly and it was very tender and delicious. I always say let me be the judge. I know a good steak when i eat one. I love steak.. . So I was looking over the menu and nothing wowed me. I asked our waitress if they had any off menu mega steaks and she said yes we have the Tomahawk Cut 32oz Rib eye long bone. I said hmm that sounds good. So i ordered it medium rare. It was $90.00  It came out pretty quick and I was feeling pretty hungry so i started to dig in. It was cooked just right which was nice. I like it bloody and still wiggling (gross I know)  It was seared perfectly and tasted good but it really needed more spices. I don't know if they just salt and peppered the steak or if they put a rub on it but it was bland in my opinion. It really needed some garlic or rosemary,thyme, oregano, paprika or something. I finished the steak in 20 minutes and I was still hungry.. I was a little disappointed on the size of the steak seem smaller then 2lbs.. . Then for desert our customer recommend we all have a round of Limoncello which i have never had before and most likely never will again. In my opinion they are way to sweet. Almost choking sweetness. I mean if you like lemon flavor you would like this but it's not good to take as a shot all in one. . . Overall our customer said the dinner was great and my Boss really enjoyed the night so I would say we most likely would recommend and or come back next year for our Sema Dinner event.. . Thanks Del Frisco's for the awesome memories!
A buddy made reservations for our group and we sat at the private room behind the James Bond table. Spoiler alert! You can see the uploaded pics, and I won't ruin it with a description, but it's not quite the same as seeing this contraption up close and personal.. . Our private dining room was next to the wine storage, and it was quite a well stocked inventory of vintages, magnums, and I think that was a Nebuchadnezzar because it was a gigantic bottle of wine. Biggest container of fermented grape juice I ever did see!. . Food was excellent. Yes, it's spendy, and the overall quality in taste, preparation, and presentation is fantastic. From what I ordered and sampled among sharable plates, you can't go wrong with any menu selection. They will go the extra mile to make sure your entree is made to your satisfaction.. . Service was fantastic throughout the evening. The waitstaff checked on us early and often. Drinks were refilled regularly. It's a good thing we were sequestered from the open dining areas because after a few rounds of cocktails and wine bottles, we got loud and obnoxious. Despite our shenanigans, service remained professional and tolerant. Our waitress was well versed in the menu and made suggestions to compliment and enhance entree selections. Whether you're in Las Vegas or other entertainment destination, it's an added bonus to have a knowledgable waitstaff, bartender, or other industry professional who might have inside info or the hookup to a nearby hotspot. Take care of them and they might return the courtesy.. . Definitely a superb experience at Del Frisco's.
We went to this restaurant on a Sunday night and it was great. Everything is a la carte and reminded me a lot of Ruth's Chris.  My husband and I both ordered the prime rib and it was cooked perfectly and was seasoned well. The lobster mac and cheese was yummy! The waiters were very attentive and we even got a thank you note when we got home. Would go back when in town.
I've never known food can be so good.. . Start with the VIP pineapple infused cocktail. It's like having your vacation in a martini glass. So good I had four of them.. . The crab cakes. Say no more. A baseball sized mound of lump crab meat swimming in a creamy rich sauce. Six monster cocktail shrimp with various sauces was equally delicious.. . Bone-in rib eye. Perfectly seared. Juicy. Tender. Well balanced seasoning. Topped with melted Foie Gras butter - are you kidding me?!! I savored each and every morsel. Just wish I had more room to finish it off and jaw on that bone.. . Lobster mac and sauteed mushrooms were wonderful sides, but we were so full we barely touched them.. . Finish it all off with the lemon cake. A perfect end to a perfect meal. Light, moist, fresh and citrusy.. . The service was impeccable throughout. Our waitress was a doll and was very attentive - always smiling. The manager came over for a chat. I felt like I was a celebrity. I frequent the NYC and Chicago DF's and now I'm also a Las Vegas fan.
Really great steak house!  The service was very good - they really go out of their way to make you feel at home here.  My husband and I got the crabcake (SO GOOD), the porterhouse steak (AMAZING) and the filet trio (this was so-so).  We also got a side of lobster mac 'n cheese to share which was pretty darn good.. . All in all, I'd recommend going with a more traditional cut of steak with no-frills.  The toppings on the filets were a little too much in my opinion.  . . Also, make sure that you ask to see the James Bond table!  Very worth it. :)
Had a business dinner in the private room.  Service was fantastic and not rushed.  I'm sure that the bill being over $2k didn't hurt.  Tomahawk steak cooked to perfection.
I enjoyed the Prime Ribeye. It was cooked perfectly for medium rare. The popular lobster macaroni's popularity is warranted. I also really enjoyed their broccoli which was buttered just the right amount. Our waiter was very friendly and deserving of working in the service industry.. . Unfortunately I had an upset stomach later that night, I think from the rarity of the steak (I didn't have anything else to eat that night). The steak was amazing nonetheless and I would go back.
