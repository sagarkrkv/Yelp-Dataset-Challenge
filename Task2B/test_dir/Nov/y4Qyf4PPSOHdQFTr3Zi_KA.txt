Josh in the movie theaters was awesome and had excellent customer service!! Well definitely go back
Garbage casino, awful dealers, go to a real casino on the strip, the dealers are rude and have no idea what they are doing, all the food is trash, slots are tight, don't waste your time here.
Stayed at Red Rock Casino and Spa for a meeting and was pretty disappointed.  They had limited transportation from the airport (shuttle bus every couple of hours ) and the cab cost $55.  The hotel has only one bank of elevators so there is one hell of a walk if you have a high numbered room once you get to the floor.  The rooms are large bot the furniture and walls are in need of updating.  We had constant problems with our key card and had to replace it three times and of course it was at the end of the night and required us to make that long walk to the elevators multiple times.  The housekeeping staff was great and our room was made up pretty early in the day.  For the price there are much better hotels on the strip where you aren't held prisoner.
Staying here for a conference. There are a lot of great things about it. It's modern and lovely. The rooms are super comfortable. They have a great big bathtub for soaking which is always nice when traveling.. . The hotel has just about everything: bowling, movie theater, food court, restaurants, 2 Starbucks, a variety of restaurants. It's big, but not overwhelming. Service is good. Not a ritz or anything, but friendly enough.. . The hotel is far from the strip. It was a $60 cab from the airport. This is good and bad. You're somewhat confined to the hotel. There's a mall next door but that's about it. It does mean lower limit blackjack which is nice. I like to start low and see how my luck goes.. . I would stay here again. It's nice to be away from the crazy of the strip...but sometimes the crazy is why you're in Vegas.
We were here for a conference.  The conference facilities are very nice. Bathrooms were always clean...but there were cleaning issues in our room.  The day we arrived, the bellman brought us ice--three days later, the bag of water was still in the ice bucket, the glass we used was still half full with water and the one that got cracked hadn't been replaced.  The dust on our night stand never was wiped clean during our entire 5 day stay (which makes you wonder what other areas are not being cleaned)  Food court is nice, but you have to walk through the smoky casino to reach it.  Pool area is nice, but there were no staff around for towel pick-up or serving drinks.   It was nice to be close to the Red Rock Canyon and since we had a car, we took advantage of visiting there.  Valet parking was awesome.   Security at all elevator entrances was a nice bonus.
Zero stars.  Zero.  Not veteran friendly at all.  Waited in line 40 mins.  Proof of my dd 214 and final discharge paper.  I would have tipped more than the buffet as I always do.  Turned away with my family.  They lost my loyalty as a summerlin resident.  Then they look at me as if I am begging for a free meal.  Please.   I brought my family with me.  Very disappointed.   Going to south point.  A real veteran friendly establishment.
Great resort! Attended the Used Car CPO Convention, and was really impressed with the resort. The decor is lavishing throughout the hotel. When you walk into the lobby the aroma makes you want to camp out. The view from our room was magnificent! Sunset to sunrise, breath taking! The bad... We didn't win in the casino!
Great buffet except for the Mexican station.  Wonderful casino, though the music can be a little loud sometimes; seems to be a new trend at some of those places.
We were very disappointed with our three day stay at Red Rock in room 16143. I was on a business trip working on a security contract at the Creech Air Force base. The first day I was at work, my boyfriend stuck around the hotel/casino grounds to mess around and wait for me to get off work. At one point while in the casino, he put his cash voucher for $100.01 into a slot machine and the screen on the machine froze while it was validating it. He pressed the service button on the neighboring machine because the service button on the frozen machine wasn't functioning. He was then descended upon by multiple slot and security people, who demanded his driver's license (and then ran off with it for twenty minutes), interrogated him for not having a "boarding pass" player's card (we're from out of town and I received one upon check in, but he did not - despite being with me at the front desk on check-in), made him retrace his steps to the previous machines he was playing on, and then finally returned with his license and forced him to sign his name on a BLANK piece of paper. A blank piece of paper?! Can you say fraud worries? He was treated like a criminal because one of THEIR machines malfunctioned! . . Anyway, after I got home from work and heard the details, I was furious. I walked down to the hotel front desk and they summoned the on duty security manager for the casino, his name was Phil. We nicely told him what had happened and he was (thankfully) appalled by it. We walked around the casino with him and gave him all of the details, and I asked that the blank piece of paper with my boyfriend's signature be returned to us, because that made me extremely uncomfortable. He agreed and said he would track it down and call back with an explanation and return it to us. We received a call with an explanation but never heard back about, nor received, the blank signed paper. I expected a bit more concern from the hotel itself regarding their guest's stay - they seemed not able to care less. . . The next day we received what can only be described as a "spam call" in our room while trying to relax. A prerecorded message talking about a $99 spa package. Really? You have to spam call your guests? . . There were people sleeping in the hallway coves of the 16th floor on Monday morning. If you feel nostalgic for the alleyways of a metro area, look no further! . . The elevators are hilariously notorious for slamming closed too quickly before you get yourself into them, as apparently witnessed by everyone in the hotel, judging by the dashes through the door upon opening and hands put out to keep them open. They don't however, have a sufficient reaction to open back up again even when they hit someone. One of them took out my shoulder when we arrived, and another woman had her arm crushed the next day while trying to hold the elevator open for us (she was able to get it out - just barely - obviously gave up, and away they went). . . It's a beautiful hotel, and the rooms are well appointed. Unfortunately, the operations of the whole thing are so reprehensible that I plan on staying somewhere else on my next trip, despite the great location.
So far it's been a very bad experience and the hotel Manager Jonathan made it even worse.  We paid using points which doesn't seem to go over well here.  We booked a room with 2 double beds, but were told at check in that all they had available was a king bed.  We proceeded to our room and walked in the door and were floored by how bad it reeked of smoke.. . We called the front desk and after wating 15 minutes, we asked for a Manager.  One of the rudest persons I've spoken to in the Service Industry (the Manager's name was 'Jonathan') told us that because we used points, we can't ask for a specific type of room.  He also told us that the smoking floor was the 19th floor and we were on the 11th, so it wasn't the hotel's fault if someone smoked in that room.  He basically told us to screw off and hung up.. . We then tried to leave the hotel, but they couldn't or wouldn't reimburse the points we used so we are stuck here.  Nightmare.
First issue, while staying I ordered room service. The reason I got a room was so as to not drink and drive, pretty common sense, right? So being I had drank I wanted breakfast. Ordered 1 meal, coffee, and a side...$45 (bit much, but ok). I leave a nice tip, only to wake up in the morning and see that there was already a tip included. I call the front desk & explain, get transferred to dining & explain, get transferred to a manager who says and I quote "It's clearly marked on your bill". To which I reply, no it is not. Everything is in the same font, size, and nothing is made to stick out. The delivery person also did not mention the included tip. (because I have worked in the service industry for 10+ years I know you are obligated to show or tell the customer you've charged them, and most importantly you don't condescend them, refuse to listen to them, and most importantly rectify the situation so that they will come back). Ergo, I will NOT EVER STAY AT RED ROCK AGAIN OR SUGGEST ANYONE TO STAY THERE EITHER. One night stay advertised at $99, amount I ended up paying after being an impeccable guest and leaving the room as I found it, $170. Excuse me?!?!. . HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, WITH NO ATTEMPT TO APPEASE UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS.. . Second issue, if you make a reservation online you can only use a credit card. If you want to pay cash for the room you have to book in person, at the front desk. BUT if you book it at the front desk they will not honor online or over the phone discounts, like AAA, ..etc. . . Third issue, there is a "resort fee" so if you pay $110 for your room they charge you $28 on top of that for the resort fee. It's deceiving. . . And don't forget, on top of that they take a "$100 deposit". This "hold" has to go on a credit card. Which can be held for days or weeks!. . Simply said, thumbs down Red Rock.. . As a local I'm just not happy.
