If you like staying at the slums and love horrible customer service, I would recommend this place.  Talk about a waste of money. . . From the time that you call and reserve your hotel, the phone CSRs sound like they don't want to be at their job......Seriously.  They sound unmotivated.  Their attitude is ""next.."
The one thing I have kept on saying while I stay at this hotel was... You get what you pay for. We stayed for two nights at this hotel last weekend. I noticed there is plumbing problem in the bathtub. I called technician three times over the two days and guess what. No one sent anybody to our room. For 2 nights 3 days, three girls had to take shower in the bathtub that won't drain ever and it was nesty!!! I chose this hotel for the good price and I heard it has a good view of Vegas strip. I only saw some brown-back side of parking structure. Hotel staff and hotel operators were not friendly and even rude. Never going back to this hotel again
My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights with a group of friends. For the price i didn't expect anything, but I would say I had a wonderful experience there. My boyfriend forgot his toothbrush, and the housekeeping lady gave him a bunch and even some extra stuff. The room was clean and nice. The hotel gave us some complementary coupons for the buffet - it's ok but we had a good time there. We went to the top of the tower, and it was amazing that you could take those scary rides and see LV Blvd at the same time lol
Alors le Stratosphere .... C'est l'endroit a Vegas ou en prendre plein la vue. Et ouais, c'est du haut de cette tour que vous pourrez prendre de somptueuses photos sur le strip, avec des couleurs par milliers (la vue est magnifique). Mais pas que. Et ouais, le stratosphere, il fait un peu tout:. - hotel. - restaurant. - bar. - attraction touristique avec sa vue a 360 sur tout Vegas. - parc d'attraction. . Oui oui, parc d'attraction. Vous ne revez pas. Quand vous montez au point de vue de la stratosphere, vous avez 4 choix a l'achat du billet: vous pouvez prendre un billet simple pour la vue (ce que j'ai fait), et ensuite au choix vous pouvez prendre des combo: un combo vue + 1 attraction, ou 2 attractions... Ou 3 attractions. Ma foi, etant de nature un peu sensible, non, je n'ai pas voulu faire l'attraction qui vous propulse les pieds dans le vide en faisant comme si on vous projetait en dehors de la stratosphere, ni celle qui vous monte sur l'antenne de la stratosphere pour vous descendre en 15 secondes. Non j'ai rien fait de tout ca. Mais j'ai vu un mariage dans la tour ! (Comment ca, ca compte pas?) . . A faire, la vue vaut vraiment le detour si vous n'etes pas deja dans une suite avec Bradley Cooper ou George Clooney au Ceasar's.
First of all, my wife and  I live in Vegas. I work for Clark County. I made a reasonable request. I wanted a non-smoking room. The first 2 reserevationis taccepted my request without question, accept they kept on dropping my calls during the reservation. The third time, a narcisistic reservation agent (She seemed to apologize but turned around and said they never drop calls), quoted policy and procedure and said that she could not guarantee the other request. She gleefully handed me over to her supervisor. He backed her up and offered a refund. I have been going to the Stratosphere with my wife for seven years. This was to be our seventh wedding anniversary there. We were not asking for a bottle of champagne or any special favors. Everyttime we have been there, they had to move us to another room because something was always wrong, smoke filled rooms, toilets broken, broken a/c. Thanks Francisco! You admitted your company doesn't give a crap about it's customers!
The casino is pretty dead, I'm not too sure about the rooms because i havent stayed but all the tourist attractions they have available there is the reason why i'm giving them 4 stars! the bar/lounge on the top floor with the killing thriller rides on the top is what makes this place cool!
Motels provide better service than this hotel. Stay away. . . First thing: their wifi does not work. When we called about it, they sent a technician up to our room but he couldn't fix it either. He then disclosed that they've been having problems with the wifi, but only in the particular area where our room is. Lies. Wifi does not work no matter where you are in the hotel. Our rental car got hit by the valets, and we had to file a claim. They apologized. Concierge whose job is to provide information gave us the wrong information, causing us a 30 minutes walk. Our room was not serviced even though we left a sign requesting it outside or door. We left that morning at 11am and returned at 6pm. We called down to housekeeping twice to no avail. When we asked the front desk, they told us that "technically room are serviced every 3 days unless requested," which I pointed out we did. They insisted protocol is every 3 days unless requested.
I didn't have any problems! Room could've used better lighting but I guess that's Vegas. Other than that, clean contemporary room. Nice bathrooms and the hotel seems to have a bounty of activities although I was only there on a quick short overnight. The clerks were nice and helpful. Room was only about $55 all said and done. Wifi is free at slow speeds, pay 10 for high speed. Hotel buffet is very good
Do yourself a huge favor and stay elsewhere during your Vegas visit. The Stratosphere is at the asshole of the strip. Nothing around it except ghetto and the SLS. We made the mistake of booking here because it was reasonably close to theconvention center. Take a shuttle or cab from the more populated part of the strip and skip this locale. . While we saved a bit with the room, we lost just as much money with cab fair or were stuck at the Stratosphere and it's terrible restaurants and tight electronic poker games. . There is an almost $20/night resort fee which covers terrible Internet (I disconnected from it and used my cell data plan, that's how slow it is), a pool I never saw, and a filthy weight room with no collars for the free weights. Seems like a liability to me, but hey, the real liability was booking here to begin with. . I will say that the registration staff were very nice to us. . If you do make the mistake of staying here, stay in a group for your security if you venture out into the surrounding area.
Hadn't been to the Stratosphere in a while, but it hasn't changed much since my last visit. The upgrades to the rooms and hallways seem to have held up for the past few years and what was remodeled, still looks pretty new. Also love the fact that it doesn't smell too much like cigarette smoke like some other casinos.
I mean really...a monkey could run a hotel better. Even with the room upgrade the rooms are of less quality that an average Marriott room even. Went here because one of my friends didn't want to go elsewhere because of the price, but you end up paying extra fees and if you want to go anywhere enjoyable I'd recommend a taxi or it's a couple mile walk. Do yourself a favor, go big, stay at a nice hotel/resort, and have a magical time in Vegas. On top of all this their rooms aredirty and have bed bugs. I ran my hand across the wall and dust went everywhere, a lot of dust, never seen so much dust on a wall.
It's older but it did it's job! This was my first time staying in another hotel other then TI (treasure island)! I started thinking after I booked this hotel did I make a mistake? But was actually kinda happy i did :) it's away from the popular main strip so it's quiet or maybe it was just bc it was off season? Who knows but I didn't hear a sound at night and slept like a baby :) Comfy beds huge tub and clean room! They have Mc Donald's in the shops that's open 23-7 only closed from 4-5am I think he had said. Which is nice when you just want something cheap to eat after leaving the bar Late night, or Roxys diner. I do have complaints though as soon as we walked in we were harassed by these woman at the entrance! I mean as soon as we walked in! All we wanted to do is check in our rooms the last thing we wanted was them stopping us asking 300 questions about how long were we here for, do I own kids , when's the last time I brushed my teeth, lol ummm no I don't want to sit in a timeshare presentation to get a free crappy breakfast that would cost me 6$ to begin with! They caught us everytime we went to the parking garage! Just upset me! So park valet that's the only way around those people! This would have been a 4star for the staff and clean rooms and it being quiet! But those timeshare ladies just ruined it!. . Just a FYI ... Get a rental car if you stay here it's far from the main strip and I'm just saying I wouldn't walk around at night in this area lol the more north you go the more bums and creatures of the night you will see
Do NOT stay here! . . We upgraded our room for an additional $25/night.  The A/C was reading 68 but my thermostat said the room temp was 78. Very hot.  Couldn't sleep.  Took over a day to get anyone to look at it and that guy shrugged his shoulders and walked out. . . The McCall's grilll had no service.  Couldn't get a drink nor the bill. . . C bar was disgusting.  Smelled like vomit.  Broken glass on the floor.  We were there 20 minutes and couldn't get service. . . I will NEVER come back.
We stayed here from the 22-24 of November. I paid roughly about $150 for two nights. I was unsatisfied with the bathroom, as the counter space was extremely limited, as well as the maid service. I didn't get asked to upgrade at the front desk upon check in like everyone around me. After seeing our families select room I was very disappointed with our room. HOWEVER I BELIEVE WE GOT WHAT WE PAID FOR. All the staff of the hotel were extremely friendly. The shops are fun and the food is good. If you don't mind being a little far from the strip I would stay here. The rides are really fun but buy your pictures during the day because they raise prices for pictures at night.
The Stratosphere was built around the time I turned 21. It was cheap, in a good enough location, and it had a good vibe. Back then there were the new flashy hotels and the cheaper more old school $5 steak&lobster dinner ones. The Stratosphere was kind of in the middle. Over all the best value in Vegas...back then.... . For years Stratosphere was great, but now it's really showing it's age. It's kind of dark and depressing. The rooms are tired and needing renovations.. . Will I come back? Maybe. The location means you pay more in cab rides, that eats into the savings of this hotel, and it's slowly making some of the other places on the strip a better value.
They gave us a handicap room and oh my gossssh...the bathroom is not so functional for a non handicap person. :(
We got an updated room with strip view on 15th floor of select tower. Excellent price. Around $65 which also included access to observatory ( we saved on  a family of 4). McDonalds in the hotel . Includes access to fitness /pool.
Although I have never stayed here as a guest, we frequent this casino with people who are visiting, come and see shows, etc. They always seem to have cool stuff going on! Yes, it is a bit "ol' school" smokey, no doubt. . . The view from the 107 Lounge ( 107th floor Bar) is 180 AMAZING! Hands down the best in the city!. . Have never tried the rides on the top, or jumping off the building, but if you are a true thrill seeker! You can jump from 109th floor to the 2nd! Seriously! . . We always have fun here! Worth the excursion to the far end of the strip!
