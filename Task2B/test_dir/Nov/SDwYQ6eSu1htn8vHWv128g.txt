Definitely one of my favorite places because they have great wine and yummy bruschetta! I've brought family, new friends and pretty much everyone here. We always get the bruschetta here! It's the perfect sharing plate. The live music is a plus when they have it and it's just a chill environment.
The bruschetta here is seriously wonderful. I try to avoid gluten so I tried the gluten free bread tonight and it was fabulous! I would definitely recommend the prosciutto and fig as well as the warm artichoke - they are so good. It's a fun wine selection and a great atmosphere.
Postinos Arcadia is a fun, stylish and consistent location. We were greeted immediately when walking in from the Manager Jaime, she was kind and quickly showed us our seats. The entire wait staff was prompt and efficient. We went with the Butchers Block and the Bruschetta Board. Both were amazing! We have been coming to Postinos for years now and have tried a few locations. This one seems to be our favorite. I would like to say a special thanks to Jaime who not only was the first one to greet us immediately walking in but was also the last one to show us out. She was certainly on top of her game and it was reflected by her staff. By far our best experience yet.
My favorite place!!  Bruschetta is amazing and I love the Italian Picnic salad.  Service is always great.
After a long day of rock-climbing, we were looking for a place to sip some wine and order a few hors d'oeuvres. According to Yelp, Postino's seemed like a suitable choice.. . It didn't take long before we were raving about our choice. Postino's nailed everything. The setting was casual yet sophisticated with outdoor seating heated via lamp. The wine (or mimosa for me) were delicious. The main sell is their bruschetta. For $14, you can choose four different set of toppings out of a list of eight or so. Each one is spectacular from the prosciutto & mascarpone to the salmon and pesto. The butcher block is an equally tantalizing option--quite possibly the best goat cheese around. Finally, if you aren't convinced yet, the happy hour specials are more than a mere $1 wells. Stop by, you won't regret it.
I met a friend here for lunch. I had been to the Postino restaurant on Central but this was a first for the one in Arcadia. Originally, I was skeptical to go here for lunch because I knew the parking wasn't great. I ended up valeting my car... . . . Postino is a great restaurant. The service was great along with the food. The waiters didn't come around too much which is good when your having a conversation with a friend. . . Keep up the good work!!
