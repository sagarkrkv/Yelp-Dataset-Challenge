My wife and I were here for Halloween.  This was definitely an entertaining experience, but one we probably won't revisit.. . The good: it was a fun atmosphere, and the ambiance was incredible.  The dragon's breath and "rise of the empress" theme were great.  The drinks were not rediculous for a club.  Some bottle packages were obviously not feasible, but interesting to read.  Paying for early access was definitely worthwhile instead of waiting forever in line.  The show part of the club experience was fun.. . The bad: we felt the guest DJ (Danny Avila) was better than the resident  (Tiesto).  We paid for access for a world-class DJ experience in Vegas.  I could have done better 30 minutes from home in Chicago.  Makes me question his tour show experience.  I think the bouncers also let anyone in, regardless of how intoxicated people may be.  This is a total hazard any way you look at it.. . All in all, it was an average club experience.  If you live near a major city and have access to decent clubs, don't bother coming.  If not, or you are really psyched up to see a specific performer, this is an ok place to party.
There is no doubt that this club is beautiful, upscale and impressive. It has multiple floors and rooms to escape to for different tastes.  . . I had a lot of fun dancing in the Ling Ling club area which was more hip hop.. . DJ Tiesto was amazing for Halloween and with the way the venue is set up it feels more like a private show then being at a huge place where you can barely even see the performer. Awesome light sequences, music and talent provided. . . Ladies- in the restroom there are attendants who can help with things such as tampons, hairspray, even to go flats for hurting feet. . . Lots of stairs so ladies might want to wear shoes they can walk in, on top of this there is almost no where to sit unless you have a VIP section somewhere. . . The concert area on level 4 for EDM shows gets way too packed and people start getting aggressive, not personally my thing, but it does come with the scene. . . Be ready to spend some money or hope you get hit on and hope that person wants to buy you drinks bc one is $16...and it's small. $9 for a Fuji water bottle that's smaller than average size of course. . . Ladies if you stand by a VIP section on the 5th floor balcany area later in the evening (when people are more drunk) and dance around they may invite you into their section and you can see the performer a lot better..and not have 500 people bumping into you!
I was led to believe I was getting in for free but then I had to pay $50 to be squished into a club like a Jewish sardine. This was the holocaust of night clubs. DO NOT GO HERE.
Bottom line- this club is MISERABLE if you don't have a table. For guys, no big deal. You can jump around just fine. For girls in gorgeous, blindingly painful high heels, this is a problem. . . There is ZERO space to move or walk around. If you find a spot to hang your hat, bouncers will tell you to keep moving. Other reviews say "if you are a girl, hope that some guys invite you to a table." Chances are there are 100 girls hotter (by Vegas definition) than you and me in this club... I've seen them with my own eyes there. The girls that work there also fit into this category.. . Hakkasan has the most incredible DJs headlining, no doubt. That is the only reason why people go. Unless you have a hard-on for Tiesto and have been dying to see him (like me), I would pick another club. It's not a pleasant clubbing experience without a table here. . . I also have a problem with one of the bartenders. You see, I used to bartend and always count the pours at each club I go to. I was surprised she was pouring 4-count (1 oz) drinks for $16 apiece. I would expect at least 1.25 in this town. When I asked what the pour was, she told me 1.5, and I asked her why she was pouring one ouncers instead. This is unacceptable. But she's hot, bitchy, and has the booze, so guess whoends up being right? And I still tipped her.. . If your time is limited in Vegas, I recommend going to XS or Drai's for a fun experience with more room.  I'm grateful we got in for free, but even for free again with Steve Aoki or Calvin Harris headlining, I wouldn't come back. It's so beyond crowded that it's just not fun...
Best birthday ever, came here for my 21st to see Tiesto and I couldn't have spent it another way. My girlfriend and I had a blast. Only downside is it's always packed, literally like a can of sardines. People bumping into you at all times. Tip, get table service. Totally worth it.
Unless you've got a table -- forget about it! It's the only way to go unless you'll be pushed and shoved like a sardine and can't dance all night.  Great place, beautiful people, and awesome music.  We saw Tiesto here during EDC week and he was amazing!
A really nice club with cool lighting and a few different rooms to explore. However, it's just too small & cramped for the large crowds they let in--you can barely move on the dancefloors and it's a constant struggle to stay afloat as people bump into you every few seconds. Merp!. . We got in for free/discount with a promoter and got here early but still had to wait a long time and deal with hella lines to get in. That's to be expected for such a popular club for sure, but I usually don't have such a long wait at Marquee.. . Pauly D DJs here a lot - does that excite anyone? Not me ;)
Be ready to wait in line for hours and have no fun. Nice place but really, go somewhere else.
Im not the type to write bad reviews but the staff was so awful to me that I just had too. NO STARS! If you like clubs were the staff is really rude and inconsiderate and make a huge deal about everything to the point where they get all these security men and cops on a tiny girl, causing her to get a panic attack and to sprain her ankle, this is the club for you. I had the worst experience here. The place is small and crowded so its hard getting through the crowd. I happened to bump into one on the staff and he made a huge deal and called security.. keep in mind im just a 95 pound 5 foot girl. I had a bunch of big guys after me, a staff member ron took my hand and rushed me to a room which caused me to miss a step, let me fall and sprain my ankle. They were so awful to me =( and I ended up at the hospital and couldn't even get a refund or an apology. :( Worst club I've been to in Vegas, I've never been so mistreated in my life. =(
This review is based upon the customer service and the wait, as the party I came with were never let in.. Weeks prior to our bachelorette Vegas trip, we met with a promoter who provided us details to get in for free at the club. Theremay have been a drink requirement but I am not sure. . We were told the club opened at midnight and arrived in line at 11:30 pm. We were expecting to get in, but the promoter told us that unfortunately we would have to wait anywhere from 1 to 2 hours.. We did skip a few lines to the guest entrance which was a much quicker move. However, we waited about 2.5 hrs before getting to the entrance. . Just when we thought we would be able to get in, we were told it would be $60 entrance. Apparently "being on the list" ended at 10 pm.... I am not sure how that works if the club wasn't open before then, but what do I know.... Needless to say we didn't pay. Not impressed with just the outside customer experience we received. I am sure the club is nice inside... At least it appears to be on Google.
Ling Ling Lounge is the best part of this club.  Music isn't too loud, people still dance, and causally talk.. . Main club upstairs is huge, but just not that cool for vegas.  There are some really cool VIP booths, but not enough bar access for drinks.  There is nothing really special about it.  Clubs at the Wynn look much cooler.
Hakkasan is one of those hyped places that everyone seems to talk about when Vegas nightlife is discussed.  However, I had seen the crowds and the lines when walking through the MGM, and that didn't get me very pumped.  I had also been hesitant to go to Hakkasan because several of my Yelp friends had reported phone and wallet thefts there with little care given by the management.  I know these Yelpers to be some of the most honest reviewers, including acouple of Yelp Community Managers, so I was wary.  Those reviews, along with the fact that my friend had a similar thing happen at another Vegas club with me, kept me from wanting to check out Hakkasan.  It has been over a year since those reviews were written, and the group I was with wanted to go.  We had a connection with a promoter who was able to get us in on two of the three nights we were staying in Vegas, so I decided I wanted to go too and see what all the fuss was about.  I'm glad that I did go, because I had a great time on both nights.. . Night 1 (Friday):. The line was long, and was not moving at all.  Somewhere close to 10:30PM it started to move, and it moved quickly.  Once we got in, we were greeted by what seemed to be an endless number of stairs.  There were several floors to the club, and with each floor came different layouts.  There was hip-hop on one floor and EDM on the main floor, which also had a couple of adjoining areas. The sound system and the music was good.  It was not as over the top looking as I would have expected inside, but the lights were very cool. It was a great atmosphere, with the worst thing being that the drinks were way over priced.  . . Night 2 (Sunday):. Getting in was far more chaotic because there didn't seem to be a line.  We were waiting in a different area than Friday, possibly because we had informed our promoter that we wanted a table and bottle service.  We were in a crowd of people standing around until our group was let in at around 11PM.  We were then led up to our table that was off in a random corner.  It was actually nice to have our table out of the way of all of the crowds, but it also felt like we weren't fully experiencing the club. Our group took turns walking around to dance and see what was going on in the different areas.  There seemed to be different floors open than on Friday, or rooms that we had missed.  There was a loungy area playing hip-hop, that we did not see on Friday.  It was not as good as the floor that was open on Friday because it felt too congested with a tiny dance floor.  The EDM room was opened and packed.  As for the bottle service, the staff kept all of our mixers and ice fresh.  They were super friendly and attentive.  It was worth it to get bottle service because we seemed to spend less on drinks than going to the bar, and we had a table to sit at when we got tired.  Although Sunday night was great, I preferred Friday because the music was just a tad bit better.. . Hakkasan was very polarizing it what it had to offer.  There were things that were great about it, and things that dampened the experience. I do think the good far outweighed the bad, and I would some up the plusses and misses as:. . + Atmosphere, music, and service. . - Entrance line, stairs, and expensive drinks
Hakkasan is definitely a beautiful nightclub with a great lineup, but man... it's so packed inside because of the strange layout. And extremely expensive, especially the drinks.. . I went the night Tiesto was playing, and the line to get into Hakkasan wasn't too bad, maybe less than 30 minutes but of course we got there maybe an hour before Tiesto took the stage. The lines are just beginning.. . There are a couple different floors inside Hakkasan. There's a chiller one where you actually have room, and then there's the main one. I'm not a huge fan of the layout of the main floor because it's so small. (On the plus side, I guess that means everyone is relatively close to the DJ...? The DJ is so high up that my friends had to put me on their shoulders for me to see Tiesto's whole face, haha.) They block off a decent amount of it on one side to serve as space for a line, and it's so hard to squeeze in and out of the dance floor since everyone has to get in and out on one side. So if you dance on that one side of the dance floor, people will always be trying to get past you. I think they leave a decent amount of room for tables in the back.. . Also, there's nowhere to put your drinks on the dance floor, so everyone puts them on the ground. Thanks for being very considerate. Since it gets so packed, they sometimes spray cold gas at us. Thank goodness... It gets hard to breathe for us short ones!. . They sell foldable flats inside the women's restroom, which is awesome. I got yelled at a bunch of times for walking without heels because they don't want you to step on glass.
Horrible atmosphere, way too crowded. The security were incredibly rude and pushy. I felt like I was in a mosh pit instead of a club.. If you're in Vegas, there are SEVERAL better places to go, don't waste a night at this place.
Pros: Great Djs. Steve Aoki was awesome to see spin live. . Lots of booths available if you want a private section. 30 dollars for a ticket to get in is not a bad price at all. . . Cons: Smaller dance floor. The main floor is impossible to get to after 1130. It is so packed that they stop letting people on it and you are forced to stand on the walk way.. Drinks are incredibly expensive. 15 dollars for a well mix drink, and 18 for a Long Island. Drinks are weak too. Shots go for almost 20 dollars each.. Incredibly loud so if you think you are gonna get to talk to someone in there guess again.. Main dj didn't come on until almost 130 in the morning.. Once you exit the club their is no getting back in. . Place was real crowded as I expected. It was worth the experience of checking out a Vegas club and a big name artist. I won't be back again as I'm not much of a club person. I haven't been to any other clubs in Vegas so I can't compare this to any others.
Don't even bother!. . The place looks nice but is not designed very well. The only place you can really see anything is either in a booth or on the dance floor (good luck getting there). The first time we went to this place, we had a blast. Saw Dada Life, had a pillow fight on the dance floor and generally had an awesome time. The second time there we saw Steve Aoki. Worst time I've ever had in Las Vegas! The place was way over crowded! You couldn't even find space for your own feet (had to be a fire code violation of some sort)! Tempers were flaring on the dance floor, the security guys were acting like drill sergeants and you couldn't stop for five seconds without one of them telling you to keep moving (even though you technically couldn't). They are only looking out for the people at the booths. The rest of us are obviously poor hicks in their eyes. This last time was the straw that broke the camels back. Saw Tiesto on November 22nd. Love the guy but all I could think was get me the hell out of here! The best part of the night was when our group finally decided to leave. Totally DONE with this place. I will spend my money at way better places like Drai's,  Marquee or Light (best  place on the strip)!
Calvin Harris  WAS SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP BUT WAS CHANGED TO TIESTO WITHOUT NOTICE -_-. . . REALLY PACKED OVERALL. A bunch of chicks walking with heels in their hands since they don't even let them sit on the edges of the counters. The DJ lineup is pretty good, but not worth the high cost to enter. The guest list lines are ridiculously long, but they get in.  Soooo, why would I pay $100 as a guy and around $60 for my girl if they'll eventually let you in? DRINKS ARE EXPENSIVE. . They say no kicks, tees or hats.....(YOU KNOW CASUAL CLOTHES), but there are times when there's a gang of under-dressed people with kicks and plain tees in the hip hop room. I guess you  must slip them a little dough for them to let you in your regular clothes??. . Its cool to be in there for a bit and see what its about with the cool djs but ITS NOT WORTH IT TO GET IN since you probably wont want to stay that long due to how crammed it gets.
CROWDED the night I went. It was a Friday night and Aoki was playing and it was the first night of his birthday celebration-- so getting caked and champagne showered on was a must! I would definitely work through a promoter, but even so, you are going to have to wait in this long LINE that doesn't seem like it's going to end, but every club is probably going to have long lines. I went on a random weekend too where there was no holiday associated with the dates and it was still PACKED.. . So just pregame accordingly and bring extra to drink if you want to keep your buzz cause my friends and I lost mine and we were too lazy to get more drinks at the crowded bar.. . it is a fun club though. REALLLY BIG. I'd go again for another good DJ for sure.
It's my friend's bachelorette party. Instead of a quiet, tame slumber party back at our suite, the wedded-to-be decided on a last minute romp to see Tiesto at Hakkasan. . . We lined up, $40 later, coupled with a few shots, we marked our spot on the dance floor. The first hour and a half was pleasant then I was ready to leave as it got RIDICULOUSLY crowded, like fire hazard bad. Bodies up against each other that even if you were just swaying to the music, it would've been construed as unsolicited grinding. As I led my gaggle of gals towards an exit, one of the bouncers seemed more concerned that we were trying to crash the VIP section. He kept stamping the super heavy rope divider to maintain his territory-- nevermind that he kept smashing this pole right on top of my sandaled-foot. And nevermind that I  was screaming in pain at the top of my lungs in an already noisy club.. . Eventually there was someone with a flashlight to clear us through. If you've got bags of money, I'd shell out for VIP. You'll breathe easier, feel more comfortable, and you'll get a great view of the silly little plebes in the pit down below. . . In the words of Murtaugh, "I'm getting too old for this sh!t"
TERRIBLE!!!!! That's all I can say. We had to wait for  two and a half hours just to get in and it was not worth it at all. It was so crowded that we couldn't even move. We left in 5 minutes. Will not come back.
