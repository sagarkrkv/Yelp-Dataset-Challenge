Rooms are very nice but service was horrible. Supposed to check in at 3 but kept me waiting until 5.
Great rooms and super staff. A little pricy but worth it not to have to walk through a casino. I stay here every year and it's always a welcome stay from all the cheap hotels
WOW pinkies up! Hate the man, LOVE this hotel.. Trump Las Vegas will make you feel like your pockets are much deeper than they actually are. Ultimately luxury prevails throughout this property.. It IS off the strip, but it's really not that far. I did not utilize the shuttles because it's literally a 4-5 minute walk to the strip, less if the mall is open. The convenience of no casino allows easy navigation throughout and lets you get to your room easily. And as others have mentioned, everything in this place smells phenomenal.. The rooms are very well-appointed and almost TOO big for a Vegas hotel room! You could comfortably fit 5 people in a King 1-bedroom suite.. We booked via Jetsetter and I thought we had a standard room but apparently the one-bedroom suite is a bit bigger than the standard studio suite. It was very reasonable priced with the deal we got. . The room is just astounding. Once you walk in, a full kitchen, dining area, and living room with a L-shaped couch greets you. The full kitchen has a dishwasher and a FULL FRIDGE! The kitchen is not stocked with dishes or cookware per local law but they can send up anything you need. We needed a corkscrew and it was delivered within 10 minutes. . The living room also has its own FULL bath, with a single sink and big shower.. The bedroom is MASSIVE with floor to ceiling windows and the most comfortable bathrobe I've ever worn. The bed is very comfy as well. Inside the bedroom is the master bathroom (yes, TWO bathrooms in the 1-bedroom suite!) which is probably bigger than the master bedroom in my apartment in LA. The bathroom features a jetted Jacuzzi tub that is actually much larger than a standard tub (see Palazzo/Venetian) and fits two! The vanity is spacious with two sinks and a stool for the ladies. The shower stall is huge as well with two separate shower heads! Toilet is in a separate enclosure but the wall doesn't go to the ceiling so fumes may still be an issue. . The staff was all extremely friendly and professional and I had no issues whatsoever with noise or any inconveniences.. What a hidden gem in Vegas! Will definitely consider staying here on my next visit to Vegas.
The Trump is really nice. I can see why people choose to stay here. We were lucky enough to have a stay cation here for our anniversary on Veterans Day weekend. The line was long when we got here to check in but they were pretty efficient. We were put in one of the penthouse suites so that was awesome.  The elevator ride felt like a ride because it was so fast that you had to pop your ears. . . I was impressed when I walked in. We didn't have a strip view but it was a nice view nonetheless. The room was huge. I wanted to throw a party just because it was that big. I walked into the bedroom and noticed a used condom wrapper behind the door since I closed the door to change. Gross right?! This hotel is close to a bunch of adult entertainment places so people choose the trump for that reason as well. . . The train sucks as well. You can hear the train as it passes by. Overall, it is a nice hotel but with the train nearby andthe dirty condom wrapper I won't be back.
Great hotel just a block from the strip (and right across the street from a huge mall). The room is one of the best rooms I've stayed in as far as size and amenities. The bathroom was as big as some rooms I've stayed in... it was huge.  The bathroom floor looked like it wasn't really cleaned which was a concern and the shower drain was mostly clogged (took an hour to drain). While the room was very affordable compared to rooms at casino hotels at that time, they DO get you on room service prices. I understand the usual markup on room service, but nearly fifty dollars for a couple of turkey sandwiches to be delivered?  WOAH!  All in all, it was a good stay, and as long as room rates stay that much lower than casino hotels nearby, we'll choose them again (but we'll bring our own sandwich fixings).  =)
I will not stay there again.  The train is a deal breaker for me.  The rooms are really nice and the staff is friendly and professional.
I took the family here for a two night stay cation. We had an excellent stay. The hotel is clean and smells great. The staff is courteous and accommodating. We stayed in a standard room with two beds and a Strip view. The rooms, including the bathroom, were spacious and clean.. . We don't mind walking at all, so we actually enjoyed walking across the street to the Fashion Show Mall and down the street to Las Vegas Boulevard.. . We stayed on the 31st floor and we did hear the train in the middle of the night for about 20 seconds. I don't think it was a big deal and probably wouldn't have even noticed it if I didn't read previous reviews.. . Be aware if you book the room through another website and put occupancy of "4", you will be given a room with a king and a pullout sofa. There is $25/night fee to have a room with two beds, which we needed. I don't mind paying it, but just disclose the fee (just like the resort fee) before I book so I'm not hit with the charge at the front desk.. . I would have no hesitation staying here again for the rate we got and would recommend the hotel for anyone looking for something a little different than other hotels directly on Las Vegas Boulevard.
ABSOLUTELY AWFUL EXPERIENCE! DO NOT STAY HERE. Unfortunately I had to give this 1 star, I wish I could have given it a Negative 10. Coming from an experienced Trump visitor, my grandmother and uncle own condos in both the trump tower NY, and Miami. My experience with the las vegas location was BEYOND AWFUL. My fiance and I both got food poisoning from the chicken wings. To make things worse, service is absolutely awful. Jasmine Diaz, who took multiple orders of our in suite dining, yes we stayed in a suite, specifically 5911, was incredibly rude and unprofessional. After my fiance and I got food poisoning, I called to order something of substance because after having food poisoning, we were desperate. She said, "I can't see your past orders, so what do you what the freaking chicken wings or wha?" I was flabbergasted. After being a loyal Trump attendant, also my grandmother's passing has left me to own the condo in the Trump Tower in NY, 721 5th ave; I am beyond astonished. I can't imagine how they treat residents in the "standard rooms", nor should that matter- I am thoroughly in shock and appalled. I WILL NEVER stay here again, save your time and money, and shoot for the Bellagio. Do not stay here. I am sickened with the service, food, and all around lack of professionalism; as well as, even common courtesy by the hotel. Please save your money, do not stay here.
My husband and I stayed here about 4 years ago.  Boy, have they gone down the drain.  All the help are very very nice and well trained.  But wow, have they started. nickel and dime you.  They charge 25 a day for a hotel charge but when my husband went up to the spa they wanted 12 extra TO USE THE STEAM OR SAUNA!!!  Unbelievable.  No slippers in the rooms and their robes where so old and scratchy.. No cue tips no cotton as well in the rooms.  They were very accommodating by. putting a foam pad on the bed so it was not as hard.. . When we were there 4 years ago, they had a wonderful chef there. We were there. for 4 nights and had dinner there 2 of them.  This time we were also staying for. 4 nights and were so looking forward to have dinner there.  First came the Martini, way to much vermouth in it.  Our first appetizer where crab cake and pork belly.. We waited for almost  l/2 hour  and when they finally arrived they were COLD.. We both took one bite and realized it, as well as very poorly presented with. 2 tiny pork belly pieces we absolutely could not eat it.  We were very disappointed. at the menu as well.  Mr Trump really needs to get a new chef there asap.. We are foodies, and our son is a Executive Chef in Dallas, I as well is a very. good cook, so we do know good food.  . We had dinner at Picasso at the Bellagio , outstanding food and beautiful. presentation. . And wonderful service.. Mr. Trump please pay some attention to this beautiful hotel.  It needs. your help.. Also get rid of the BARKING DOGS !!!!!!!!. And a bench outside for waiting for the shuttle would really help, my. husband has a hard time standing.
Large rooms. Clean. Has fridge, microwave, stove and kueurig coffee maker. All nice items to have! The bed is very comfortable. Soft plush robes are provided. The bathroom is huge, with shower and tub, two sinks and separate bathroom stall. Good location, it is across the street from the fashion show mall. You can walk through the mall to get on the strip or take the complimentary shuttle to Caesars Palace or the Wynn hotel. . Overall: We like this hotel and would definitely stay here again
Love the jacuzzi and the mirrored tv.. If u dont smoke and gamble, and just want a nice quiet place to stay, then choose this one.. But if youre a first time Vegas guest, then pick the one on the vegas strip.. i smoked and loved playing slots in the casino.. i checked in here for a change...
