Dinner was fantastic! I'm allergic to wheat flour so finding good quality options at buffets is always a challenge. I called ahead to make sure I wasn't going ti pay a tin for one out two choices. Chef Russel went over all my options for each station of food (dinner buffet) who the chef would be that evening. Within five minutes of arriving, we were given a detailed tour by Chef Jen. She went over all of my options again and told me what to stay away from. She had another chef start my gluten free ravioli while I got my first plate and had them set aside a gluten free brownie in the warming station. Jen was great because she explained which foods might be at risk for cross contamination, which are kept completely separate etc. Highly recommend this place. Oh yeah, and my husband loved the crab legs.
just wow !!!!!!  i'm so disappointed at my first visit to as you might call it a high class hotel buffe  with nothing to eat and for it to be $86 dollars  for 2 people you would expect to have some nice choises i would have had a nice dinner out with good food not some cold garbage crab that's been sitting for hours and i had to walk around 5 times to try fine  something to eat but came back with almost nothing in my plate save your money and stay away from this buffe it's sad but so true what's expensive it doesn't mean it's going to be good only nice thing about this place the servers are good with this said i'm out to have some real food after i ate here !!!!!!!!!!
Good, but not amazing! . The selection was good, there was a lot of variety but many items advertised on the menu outside were not available. . Beef ribs, we're SOLD OUT!  Even though we arrived slightly after 6 PM.  . In addition, a 17% auto gratuity for parties more than 6 makes for an expensive meal with an expectation of stellar service (seeing as we get our own meals?! ). I may do it again. . . . But I'd have to make sure the menu was as advertised before paying. ;)
Better than a lot of Buffets in Vegas when it comes to their vegan options.... (I included some pics ) oh and tip is to ask for small servings..... like we didn't need such large servings of each option when eating buffet style. . . SIDENOTE : the chef who gives the tour is awesome!. . #VeganBreakfast / Vegan Breakfast
We stopped in at The Buffet for lunch on a Friday after checking into the Wynn. I was very impressed and thought they had a really great selection, and the decor in the outer seating area is just beautiful. The food was good, and definitely one of the better Vegas buffets, but nothing was super impressive - I was torn between 3 and 4 stars. From vegans to carnivores they have something for everyone, so if you have a group with diverse eating preferences this would probably be a great spot for you.
Well this place did not live up to the hype I've heard and read about.  The selection was ok and variety was not nearly as good as my top ranked caesars buffet.  They do however do a nice job of presentation, the layout and cleanliness is top notch.
Alright, I came to Vegas on a budget (it's Vegas I know, you gotta ball) with the intentions on dropping money on a good buffet. Me and my stretchy pants were ready. I googled "best buffets in Vegas" the buffet say the Wynn came up ranked number 2. I knew for dinner on a weekend I was gonna pay minimum $35 dollars anywhere. We chose here because we were walking the strip and the google results seemed promising.. . Dinner price is $44 and change a person. I was determined to get my money's worth. . . (Note: for being such a upscale and nice hotel with a "reputation" you would think their employees uniforms would be more elegant and classy than the pepto bismol skirt suit the hostesses wear. It's a random comment but that really threw us all off.). . The service was great. The woman working the tables for beverages was attentive and prompt with our drinks. . . I gave the buffet a quick rundown to scan the food before I dived in. I was surprised with a ramen Bar which was cool even thigh I didn't try it. I didn't come to Vegas to eat ramen, pizza or Mac n cheese and a salad. . . I'm not really into seafood but I gave the crab legs, shrimp and oysters a go. They were okay to me but what do I know. . . I'm a meat and carb girl so I loaded up on the protein. I had prime rib, ribs, sausages, veggies, potatoes, made my own meat cheese plate and sampled the Italian section. . . I was satisfied. I don't see why the buffet gets so many low reviews? The food was delicious and I sampled a little of everything. . . They had a salad bar, meat cheese section, Asian, Hispanic, seafood, and American choices as well as a Dessert Bar. . . I've had worse, last time I came to Vegas I ate at the MGM buffet and that to me was mediocre. . . I would come back. But next time I think I'll give my monies bang at the Cesar's or bellagios buffet.
We came here for the brunch buffet on Sunday around 10:00am. The line was ridiculously long. They do allow people to hold places in line for their late friends which is annoying. The girl in front of us had about six people cut the line right when we were about to be seated. The cashier did not seem to care about the people complaining about the line cutters. We were seated at 11:15am. The food selection was great and very diverse. Brunch offersbreakfast and lunch/dinner items. There is a phenomenal dessert selection. The price is fairly reasonable at $32 a head. It is an extra $16 a person if you want to do unlimited champagne. The food gets 5 stars but I had to give 4 stars overall. I can understand holding a place for your spouse to go to the bathroom but not for an entire group of people to cut. Please address this Wynn.
My how much can change in 4 years. In 2010 this was a quality buffet with premium meats and such. We went back last week and the food quality has really deteriorated. Selections such as Mac n cheese, mushroom bisque, and potstickers were all very unmemorable. All dishes were overly salty. Crab legs were sub-par and served cold. Perhaps this is the norm? I've only had hot ones in the past, that were far fresher and more flavorful. At least they are sliced in half lengthwise for easy access to the meat. My companion had shrimp cocktail and didn't mention it being particularly good. I had a lot of seafood during my stay in Vegas and none of it impressed. There was a station with turkey and prime rib waiting to be carved, however, each time I walked by there was no one to be found to serve me so I can't comment on that. There was a good section of vegetables and the roasted cauliflower was delicious, albeit tragically oversalted. I steered clear of the stir fries, fearing salt poisoning after having tasted other salt-laden dishes. I didn't try any Japanese items as none looked particularly appealing. At first glance, sushi rolls seemed to be too dense in rice and lacking fillings. The Italian section with its salamis and cheeses was tempting, but when you're paying $35 a plate you don't generally rush over for cheese and crackers. I think it might make a nice starter snack though in retrospect, since none of themain dishes were stellar. Soups were salty and lacking depth. Desserts were hit or miss, with the Black Forest cake lacking cherry or dark chocolate flavors and seeming to taste mostly just "sweet". I avoided the dense items such as cookies and cakes and went for the blood orange panna cotta which was delightful, and the mango tapioca which also proved a winner. The tiramisu was also pretty good. Service was excellent, drinks were always kept full, Arnold Palmer's were refreshing after one too many vodka sodas at the casino. I didn't think about tipping since the receipt at the cashier when you pay has a tip line, hopefully the server gets a share of that rather than just the cashiers! I had no cash so I couldn't leave her anything additional. I definitely won't be going back to the buffet. I was also hungry a few hours later, go figure! I was a bit irked by that. I suppose nothing was good enough for me to want to gorge myself. For those with less discriminating palates and larger appetites, it might be worth the cost but certainly not for my friend and I.
No choose for veggie lover and seafood lover need to give more choose for Indian food
The husband and I wanted to hit up a few good buffets during our stay. We received mixed reviews for the Wynn buffet, but found it easy to eat at since we were going to watch le reve. After standing in line for about 20 mins (on a Tuesday around 7pm) we were seated. The entry way is gorg but lead back the buffet area the decor seemed a bit outdated, but still very nice.. . The food experience - I just didn't find anything special. The food is all good, but nothing was drool worthy.  They have salads, american, Italian, grilled foods, ramen station, asian and seafood. It was a great variety, but like I said nothing stood out. My favorite was the dessert bar. It had a good variety.
One of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas. . . Lot of variety... . * salad bar . * cheese & ham bar . * Italian . * American . * Asian . * Mexican . * Seafood . * dessert . . My favorite was the dessert! Their crime brulee is delicious as well as their tiramisu. They have a good ice cream selection as well as their cookies & treats. . . Lots of seating, I've been a few times and never once had to wait.
As far as buffets go, the food is quite good. But I don't think I'll do buffets any more. The wait was ridiculous, almost three hours. I was planning to go for brunch, but it became dinner. About $110 for 2, then add the drinks ($16 per person for beer, wine, champagne, bloody mary), the total is almost $150 (and after tipping the waiter, clearly more than that).. As I said, food was decent, but if you go for a "real" restaurant, it will be better.. The drinks were disaster: the "champagne" was some sweet sparkling wine, but drinkable; the red wine was "capstone cabernet" which you could drink with food, but don't smell it (I couldn't finish the glass); the bloody mary was most peppery I've ever had, I had two sips of it (of a 16 oz glass).. The desserts were good.
Fantastic dinning experience.  Went on THANKSGIVING DAY because we had heard it was best place to eat in LV.  And it was.  We all loved it.  The best part was that there were no lines for food once you got sat.  They have a VIP package for a couple of bucks more which means no line to get in that includes a glass of Bubbly and 10 percent off your next visit (pays for itself) .  Not sure why anyone would wait three hours?. . Also, Brenda the General Manager came to our table to see how everything was a nice touch.  . . Have been to many buffets in the city and this is the very best.  Lived up to its reputation.
One of the best buffet in Vegas . Tried most of the food, salads and soups. . . They should have better Sushi varieties and the taco was less than average.
The Buffet was a disappointment this time. Oysters  r soggy n old, ahi tuna looks dark n soggy, the rib eye is chewy, and the rest of the food like crab legs , ramen and even bread are extremely salty. Can't believed i stood in line for such a low quality food. Nothing was good this time. I was here 5 yrs ago and quality has declined steeply. Very sad. Service- good.
This was a mixed bag. What was good, was very good. What was bad, was awful. However, it was the stuff you would think would be a no-brainer was really disappointing. For example, the prime rib was almost raw, not medium rare or rare, raw. The fish and shrimp were underdone, as in semi translucent. The cheese pizza had so much Romano it was unpleasant to eat. And a lot of the food was cold and the server was almost never around and it was hard to get refills. But, I will say that the pear and gorgonzola filled pasta was outstanding. The mac and cheese was good, not special, but good. The streamed buns were very good. The Chinese duck soup was wonderful. The crab legs were great, and I don't usually like crab legs. The desserts were very good, especially the passion fruit tapioca. Overall, for the price, this was sub par.. However! Right after I finished this review... My husband lost his entire dinner!! Couldn't make it to the bathroom. What freaked me out was the staff. They were completely jaded, not surprised or horrified. And that makes me wonder... Does this happen often?!?!!! So, this review was going to be two stars, but I've taken it down to one star since there was obviously something very bad served.
Nothing spectacular just average, in fact I was staying across the street at Treasure Island and their buffet was better than this one and much cheaper. The hotel itself looked nice inside and obviously catered to the upper class.
