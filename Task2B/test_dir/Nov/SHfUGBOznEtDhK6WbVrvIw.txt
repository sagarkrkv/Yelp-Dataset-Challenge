Good smoked meat. But the service is not that good
This place is very tasty!  We really enjoyed out visit.
Schwartz has the best smoked meat I've ever had. There's always a lineup. The inside of the restaurant is nothing special so I would recommend getting a take-out instead. It saves time and you get the same quality meal. Order their fattest meat with a pickle. That's all you need.
Perhaps I'm biased from growing up near NYC or in a Jewish household (albeit conservative), but Montreal's version of pastrami / smoked meat has got nothing on the real deal in Brooklyn.  After hearing so many rave reviews from family members and friends, I was really expecting to be blown out of the water, but unfortunately I was instead left drowning in disappointment.. . The price is probably OK for the buck for their smoked meat sandwich (since they give you so much meat!), but although it's soft and falling apart, it is absolutely fatty and flavorless.  It has nothing special going for it whatsoever with its pound of meat doused in yellow mustard on soggy white sandwich bread.   Even on the outside bark of the meat itself I was searching for some other flavor than some oppressive salt that they used, and found absolutely nothing worth savoring.. . Honestly, I don't get it.  Maybe it was better 50 years ago and the hype train keeps it going today, but there's nothing worth your time here.  Go elsewhere and find the actual good food in Montreal.
My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to never wait in line. If you're ok with sitting at a table with strangers up close and personal in a super hot and small resto, this is the place for you. The food is delish! The smoked meat is fantastic as are the pickles. Mmmmmm can't wait to go back
Not a lot of times you will remember a taste of a meal for a long time ,, but trust me, you will with this one!
As good as it gets for Canada....you want real smoked meat come to NYC!!!
I've never been a huge fan of smoked meat, but Schwartz's definitely made my little heart change for the better!. . Coworker went to school at McGill, so he definitely knows his way around Montreal...and he highly recommended that we come here to eat..and boy was I glad that he dragged us into this noisy, janky, cramped, and old diner (I mean this is most rustic way!!). I love the feel of this place! . . We all had the smoked meat sandwich, and I really appreciate that they let you chose the cut of meat: fatty, lean, or half-half. :) . . When our sandwiches arrived, and I bit into my sandwich it was like a chorus of singers sang with joy! The meat was perfectly seasoned, smoked, melt-in-your-mouuuuttth! The bread to meat ratio was spot-on and didn't overwhelm the palate. . . Yes, I love Schwartz. :) Thank you, dear coworker, for giving my stomach that extra push it needed to convert into a smoked meat fan!
It's a busy, old school deli with service is exactly what it needs to be - efficient. Once you get a seat - prepare to wait in line - your order is in front of you 5 min tops. The smoked meat sandwich is delicious. I wish I had more time to explore some of the other items on the menu. Can't wait to go back.
Great sandwich. I never liked corn beer, smoked meat sandwich until i got to try Schwartz's.  Medium fat meat with mustard + rye bread = 'Winning'
We walked in and were immediately greeted with hospitality. We sat at the bar and by recommendation from our server got the medium smoked meat sandwich which was amazing! We are glad we didn't go with the fatty (you have 3 choices- lean, medium or fatty) because it medium was perfect. Meal came out literally 2 minutes after ordering. . Black cherry soda was very sweet but very tasty. Nash is like a slim Jim- worth trying, but not our favorite. . The servers were funny, nice and made us feel right at home. One even made us each a paper napkin rose. Totally satisfied!
mannn did we get lucky with the line when we headed out here! opened the doors & was seated right away... given it was even a packed night in the restaurant! i am still in disbelief that this simple sandwich is full of mouthwatering flavor. literally just smoked meat, a little mustard, & wheat bread. how... like, how?! is it so so so good!??!! there's hardly anything in it! in a world that i live in here back in the states we often eat food that is overly jammed packed with different ingredients i guess we forget how simplicity is also very delicious. you can choose 3 levels of fat content you want in your meat... the two is just right ... with the perfect balance of fat & meat. very very juicy. our server was so polite & helpful. service is REALLY quick. this place can easily be categorized as "hyped" based on the amount of yelp reviews ... but y'all take that back right now because it is not hyped at all. come see for yourselves.... it's the best!
This is the bomb. After only getting smoked meat from here for years I finally decided to try another smoked meat deli. Definitely regretted that. Get the large plate to share and a black cherry each. That's what I've been doing for years. Although I'm an anglophone Torontonian living in the US. I don't know if that qualifies me to give anyone advice about Montreal.
