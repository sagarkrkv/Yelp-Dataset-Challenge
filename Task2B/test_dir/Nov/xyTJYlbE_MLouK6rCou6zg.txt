I had a Greek burger plus jalapeno .. it is not exactly a burger , as it has a pita bread instead. it was awesome and delicious
One of the best burger and beer spots around. I had been to the one in San Francisco a few years ago so when I saw this one I knew it would be an excellent lunch spot. . Great burgers, excellent beer selection, very nice servers and good fast service. Absolutely nothing bad can be said about this place.
My Wife and I went here and we were not happy. I ordered the Build your own Kobe burger w/ sweet potato fries and my Wife ordered the bar wings and fries. The fries were the only hot items on our trays.  The burger was just OK and it was room temperature.  The wings were cold. We waited 40 minutes for our food. People that sat down next to us 10-15 minutes after we were sitting got there wings and burgers before us. I ordered a medium burger ao that didn't cause the delay.. . Overall not the 4 star experience as stated here on Yelp. I was so excited.  I mean it is called the Burger Bar and burgers are my comfort food. I was not comforted nor happy.. . I will not be coming back to this establishment and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. . . The manager apologized and comped the wings and my beer but it still didn't make up for the bad experience.  Ahe said her kitchen was having a melt down. If your number one and main item is burgers then at least that should be good. I could have gone five guys for the same quality burger.. . Sorry Burger Bar you did not live up to the Yelp hype for this burger connisuer.
I have eaten here many times over the past few years when I come to Vegas.  The food never disappoints, and the service has been consistently good.. . I recommend the buffalo, or even the veggie burger if you are looking for something different. Regardless of which burger you choose, get the seeet potato fries!  Instead of a cocktail, consider having an alcoholic shake instead for dessert.
Build your own delicious burger. . . I had a kobe beef burger with caramelized onions, swiss cheese, truffle sauce, and foie gras. . . It gets pretty busy by lunchtime so plan ahead. . . Try the sweet potato fries and onion rings.. . It's a great place with great food. Perfect for a hangover.
I've returned to Burger Bar recently and am rethinking that I was overly harsh. They do have good quality and a great variety, even though there's lots of competition now.. It's not a bad choice.
Service was Great loved our waitress but the food was mediocre at best  not worth the hefty price tag
Utter disappointment.. . I am like Jules in Pulp Fiction in that I love the taste of a Juicy Burger. With this in mind I figured Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay would have been a stone cold lock. Hundreds of beers to choose from, a masculine yet inviting interior, a packed house and even great bartenders had me sprung from the onset. In fact, I was seriously digging Burger Bar up to the point the Burger arrived!. . I decided to try the "Perfect Ten" Burger which really was more like a Perfect 5. Maybe Vegas grades on a curve? Basically they put down a (perfectly cooked) medium rare patty and top it with Gouda Cheese, carmelized Onions and serve it on a dry and stale Pretzel bun. With exception of the bun, the ingredients were fresh enough and the Burger was juicy and bold, it is just that there was no "pop" factor for me and at $16.00 it should have all kinds of wonderful in every bite. Frustrating.. . It being Vegas, I gambled big but lost in the flavor department. If you are going to drop some serious duckets on a Burger, I would suggest going elsewhere.
This place is so delicious. A bit pricey but totally worth a trip. The alcoholic milkshakes are delusion, can't even taste the booze.
Great food and decent atmosphere for a Thursday lunch. We got immediate seating for a party of 6. Downside is it's extremely expensive and had a limited burger menu that is partly made up by the build-your-own option.
Went to the Burger Bar with my brother. We both were extremely please with our orders. One of the freshest tastiest burgers I have had. I will definitely be back when I hit up Vegas again. Good stuff!
Damn good burgers.. . My wife and I split two different burgers: the lamb burger, which was spicy and delicious, and the Perfect 10, which had gouda and grilled onions. Both were incredibly tasty!. . Also, the beer list had more than 100 beers. Can't go wrong there!
I don't know what it is but since we were in Vegas I actually was considering the Rossini $60 burger.  As much as I wanted some Foie gras  I just decided on the kobe beef burger with some smoked gouda, fried egg, portabella mushrooms, caramelized onions all on a ciabatta bun.  DAMN!! that first bite was vegas worthy and worth the $25. Hahaha  Also ordered the salted caramel shake and ga-damn that hit the spot.  LOVE this place.  Check it out if your ever in the area.
