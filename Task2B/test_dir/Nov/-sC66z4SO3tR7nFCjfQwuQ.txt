Love the tacos, beer and happy hour prices.  But every time we go the service gets slower and slower.  Most recent trip service was non existant.  After waiting 20 minutes to get our order in, taking us past happy hour, the waiter then tried to charge us full price.  Sit at the bar if you can.
Sitting at the bar dirty dishes next to clean dishes! Lazy bartenders  Wtf* wow   just rude this guy needs to get his stick outta his Ass.. Look up when people are giving their order!
I've been there a few times now - three times for breakfast and a couple of times for lunch.  Breakfast was awesome, but lunch was just ok. . The service each time was mediocre and uninspired.
I've been here on a number of occasions. The atmosphere is fun and casual with ample parking and good happy hour. The restaurant is very small, and doesn't easily accommodate larger groups. I wouldn't recommend coming here during the summer months, as the restaurant was uncomfortably warm the last time I was there (August-ish). Gallo Blanco is very "meh". Just ok. Nothing outstanding. Fine for a quick drink and bite with friends but I wouldn't come here with high expectations...quite a shame considering its location in the lobby of the Clarendon hotel. Has potential to be a great spot!
Gallio Blanco is retro,trendy, upbeat,  local, delicious, authentic, and for a while the Tuesday date night spot for hubby and I. . Their guacamole is one of the best I have had. Different or maybe creative is the right word... with bits of oranges and fresh avocados. You can taste that it was made in the house.. . The tacos are authentic street taco style, on small corn tortillas. They don't have the option of flour and I'm unfortunately not a fan of corn tortillas so its more of a personal problem, but that's one star off for me because I usually end up leaving out the bread. Just one of those things.. I keep trying it every time hoping I'd like it but I end up not liking it even more. . My personal favorite is the beef burrito. The beef is flavorful and cooked to perfection.. . If you order chips and salsa, it comes with delicious fresh chips and choice of their regular salsa or 4 different salsas. My favorite is the smokey chipotle. . . I keep telling myself that next time I need to try something new on the menu but so far I haven't been brave enough. Seems like another visit is in order and I promise to update this review if I really make that step.
Living in Arizona there is obviously no shortage of amazing Mexican restaurants but I have to say... this is one of my favorites. I had the shrimp burrito and it was probably the best burrito I've ever had. The service was slow considering the place was practically empty but it was worth the wait. I will definitely be heading back here next time I'm in Phoenix and will do my best to order something else... no promises though.
Gallo has seemed to change it's wait staff since my last review. No more weird experiences or soggy tacos. I'm back in love with Gallo once again. Yay!
Go here. Get the shrimp & grits. Let your dinner companion have a bite. Then refuse to give them more when they ask, or at least extract a major favor in return.. . Food was very good and a there are some creative options. Staff was friendly. Service was friendly, but we were forgotten a couple times...
Cute bar. Great drinks and food is decent
As a Californian coming down to visit family I have to say I was impressed with the food and the service, including the friendliness of the staff.   The only thing that threw me off was the decor.  It has an underdeveloped look but I still very much enjoyed my time there.  Only removing one star for the decor but others may find it more charming.  Oh and great mimosas!
I was in town visiting and my friends brought me here for brunch.  It has a very fun, trendy vibe going.  We started with some fun drinks.  I got the chocolate fudge and vanilla ice cream shake.  I couldn't really taste the chocolate but it was still yummy.  My friend got thestrawberry shake (no ice cream) and we didn't really like it unfortunately.  We started off with chips and salsa and guacamole.  I really enjoyed the various types of salsa and enjoyed trying them all.  I got the chicken chilaquiles verdes. It was chicken with layer tortillas and cheese and salsa with an egg (cooked however you like it) on top.  I got this on the recommendation of my friend.  It was delicious!  I would definitely get it again.  . . My only gripe was that the service was very slow at times.  It took a while for the waiter to come back to check on us and for us to get our check.  I didn't mind so much but my friend was annoyed.
Went for the first time last night with another couple and all four of us just LOVED the food - was delicious! The Carne Asado is outstanding!  We had excellent service and the decor is very fun and hip. Will definitely be going back and hopefully sooner than later.  Probably the best Mexican food in town with some very unique flavors and and dishes. Would strongly recommend.
