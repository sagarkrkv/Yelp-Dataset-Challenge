I didn't know what to expect from a Beatles-themed Cirque du Soleil show, but I was thoroughly captivated by the theatrics, acrobatics, and music. Unlike other shows I've seen, the stage is centered such that I don't think there's a single bad seat in the house. . . There were many different sets, with some better than others. I enjoyed the strange circus-themed one as well as the underwater act. That being said, there was also a lot going on in many of the sets. It was really hard to focus on any one specific choreography. . . I'm a little too young to be a big fan of The Beatles, but their music and influence is truly cross-generational.
Amazing and beautiful show at The mirage. I've seen the show 3 times, each from 3 different places In the theater and all times it was incredible. In fact, there's so much going on during the Show that you truly see an entirely different show each time. . .  All of the actors truly seems to love doing what they're doing and the interpretation of the music is none like I've seen in a show before. I would recommend it to anyone staying in Vegas.
Best show in town! Wasn't a Beatles fan but I left knowing more songs than ever. No bad seats and actually the farther up you sit, the better the view.
I really love Beatles and I was anxious to see this show. I loved the show, but I've expected more for the end, and also for the song LOVE! The soundtrack was so beautiful, but the last song acting was disappointed. Even though, I still recommend this show for sure!
Brace yourself for what you are about to read. You ready??? Ok. I am NOT a Beatles Fan. Don't enjoy the music. Don't see the hype. So, seeing that I'm not a fan I was worried that I would be bored and not into the show. MAN, was u wrong! . . I loved every second of the show! The arena or theater is quite small and there really isn't a bad seat in the house. My eyes were running from side to side trying to make sure I didn't miss one single acrobatic move. I even left the show singing "All you need is love"! . . Def a must go to if your visiting or a local.
Fun show! Sing and dance to fun Beatle's song. Great stunts and fun colorful costumes. Worth the money!
Horrible horrible horrible . Hands down the worst cirque show in Vegas. I was bored out of mind and would have left early had I not been mid row. There is almost zero acrobatics. Dancing is third rate. I felt like I was watching the performers that were turned down for the real cirque shows. Complete waste of time.
It's like watching "So you think you can dance" choreographed to the sounds of the Beatles. Cute show, very little acrobatics,not my favorite!
We got 2 for the price of 1 tickets to the show on the balcony which I think are better seats than the lower bowl as you can see the activity around and below you.  There were curtains dividing the stage but they are removed for most part of the show.  Two large screens along the sides of the theatre are cool for Beatles video. . . I'm a Beatles fan so I really enjoyed the music loud and great sounding. Having been to other Cirque shows, I wasn't sure what to expect.  But I liked the mix of dancing and acrobatics and less of the comedy than other shows.  Love started off more fun with lots of activity and lots of performers to watch.. . There were a few songs that I really enjoyed including Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds with the bling and aerials.  Here Comes the Sun was another favourite of mine.  I also liked how they incorporated some imagery on the screens of the Beatles talking.  . . No photos and recording are allowed in the theatre and although there wasn't security to be seen, we saw at least 2 people caught and told to delete the photos from their phone and tablet.. . Great show with lots of props, colour, and diverse performers.  A great 90 minute show for $120US for 2.
The imagery and optical illusions were amazing and The Beatles music great, but I found myself to be disinterested in the story line and frankly, kind of bored during most of the show. I will admit I'm not used to performances like this and I'd probably give another Cirque show a shot if the price was right. Glad to say I did it, don't need to see again, but great to do once while in Vegas.
This is my favorite Cirque Du Soleil in Las Vegas. The Beatles music is used artistically and each song is themed to the performance. Such as Here Comes the Sun uses a large chandelier made out of candles to represent the sun and have dancing to the rhythm of the music
What a great show! Great theatrical experience, the music, lights, dancers, acrobatics, etc were awesome. I would definitely recommend watching it. 14 people in my family went from ages 16-91 and everyone enjoyed themselves. It was worth the price & time. We had a great experience. Can't wait to see more shows!
