I had to make reservations last minute for 10 of us and usually it's way too short notice but luckily I was able to get us in a private room upstairs and it was pretty special. All grades of steak was presented as a master piece and variety of excellent wines. All of us had excellent time.. . Price: Pricey. Staff: Extremely professional and friendly. . Environment: Classy and fun. Kids: Yes.
Don't believe the hype. There was some truly memorable things about this meal, and some things that once you read this you will think twice about going.  Just to put this review into context my meal was $600 with tip and only two drinks for a party of 4. . . The cocktails were good. You order off an iPad. The drinks were refreshing and well made. The beef tartare. Very cool presentation served in a smoke infused bowl. Only issue is that the texture was not creamy, and the taste was okay. The mixed green salads with green goddess dressing was good. Again not great. Just good.   Bread at the table was okay. 3 different types but a couple were dry. . . So here where we start going down hill. Ordered the royal bone chop. The steak is $100 by itself. There is all this hype about Pat La Frieda picking the meat etc. The steak when delivered to the table was over cooked.  You could clearly see that the cut was sub par as it was very thin. Had to send it back. Yes the waiter took care of it, but that steak should havenever been sent to the table. Was I picky yes. But if you call your self a steakhouse and are going to charge $100 per cut. It should be perfect.  My wife's was perfect. . . Sides. The potato with bechamel sauce was gross. Very sloppy. They literally poor the sauce over the potato. Corn was mushy as it was over cooked.  Mushrooms were fantastic. . . So here is the nail in the coffin and why I will never go back.   If you are a total rewards member you get discounted prices on all food. At the beginning of the meal the waiter asks to see your card which I showed them after we ordered drinks. The bill comes and I give him my card again. I go ahead and also give him my CC as I do not typically look at food bills at restaurants. I get my credit card transaction back with a copy of the bill. And guess what the waiter did not do discount; the food after he charged me. Mistake?  Maybe. But he has seen my total rewards card twice. Then I ask him to reverse the charge, and give me a corrected bill. Said he could but it would take two days to come off my credit card. Okay every transaction I have ever had reversed for error they could do immediately. My bill ended up being $30 cheaper. I will let you make the decision. . . Bottom line is that if you have been to a nice steakhouse this place will not blow you away. There is way too much hype, and the food is way too expensive. Sides are meh. I have had better steaks, and much better sides.
Service was phenomenal as you would expect from a big name restaurant. Probably the best service I have ever experienced. It didn't seem pretentious like some other luxury restaurants. . . We had the fried oysters, ribeye, beef wellington, mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and the sticky toffee pudding.. . Ribeye was good. Tender, good flavor, cooked just right. If you love a fine piece of steak, you won't be disappointed.. . Beef Wellington was great. The beef melts in your mouth and the crusty pastry went well with it.. . The sticky toffee pudding was the best dessert I've ever had. It looks simple but the texture and flavor was unbelievably amazing.. . The atmosphere is not really "fine dining," it has a lively atmosphere with a lot of energy. It's a great fit for Vegas.. . I can't think of anything to complain about.
My wife and I had dinner here. We came there at the last minute so there was no chance for a table but the bar was open so we ate there. . My wife and I split the prime cap. The best part of the rib eye. . Bar service was AWESOME!!!. Food was AMAZING!!!. Highly recommend for a higher end experience.
So first off, I am a BIG fan of Gordon Ramsay! I never miss any of his shows and have been waiting to try one of his restaurants so when we decided to go to Vegas, eating at Steak was the number one thing we wanted to do. My husband and I ate here this past saturday while visiting LV. We started off with the Gnochi and Beef sliders. I don't like beef because I'm not a fan of the taste, BUT this was my one exception to where I would eat it. The gnocchi was okay, probably wouldnt order it again if I went back. The beef sliders were very delicious! From the presentation (theyre so small, but cute) to the taste. Definitely a must try. Like I said, a HUGE fan of all his shows - so the Beef Wellington was the main reason I wanted to check this place out and i must tell you, it totally surpassed all the hype that the dish has. It was really good! The beef melted in my mouth! Yumm! By this point, we were sooo full, I was about to explode it was so much food! lol From the yelp reviews, going in we knew we had to order the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. The waiter recommended it as well. So, i have to say, it was the PERFECT ending to dinner. It was literally the BEST dessert we ever had. Dinner ended up being pretty pricey: $200 for gnocchi, beef sliders, 2 beef wellingtons, truffle mac n cheese and the sticky toffee pudding, and no drinks from the bar, but to say the least - the whole experience was amazing and food was delicious. Totally worth checking out, and so glad we got the chance to do so! Believe the hype!! :)
We dined there with a group of 10 in the upstairs dining room. Fun ambiance, excellent attentive service- we were seated around 8:00 pm and left at 11:00 pm. We were able to try quite a few items. Ordered cocktails from an iPad. The signature cocktail was refreshing and delish!- low alcohol though. My friend liked the kurobuta pork appetizer.  I loved the oyster trio appetizer- fresh and tasty! The house salad is so refreshing, much better than the romaine salad with whole baby romaine leaves! The Mac and cheese was ok- can be shared.  The loaded baked potato was perfectly awesome. The roasted chicken crispy skin was delish.  So was the braised pork.  I shared the medium prepared rib eye with a friend. The chef sliced it in thick pieces before serving. It was only ok- the exterior was quite charred, only a little pink inside, quite tough.  I was kinda disappointed. We had the toffee pudding with butter cream ice cream. The ice cream was shaped like a rectangle of butter.  So decadent!  The sticky toffee pudding was just ok.  Btw, I lost my sweater there.  It was rolled up in my open bag. While removing my oyster platter, some of the melted ice spilled in my bag.  While wiping up, I took out my sweater to dry.  In the dimly lit room, amongst dark colored napkins, a black dress and dark carpeting, my sweater was swallowed!  :(. Nonetheless, we had a grand time!  Although we were the last seating in the room, the Paris lost and found department reported that a black sweater was not turned in to lost and found.
Since we don't gamble in Vegas and had no interest in shows this go around, we decided to splurge for an amazing dinner.  My boyfriend wanted to try out some true, Kobe steak and we decided that the great Gordon Ramsay couldn't disappoint.  . . We headed in with a good giggle over the hostess' uniforms (black dresses, bright red lips and pocket watches as necklaces...they all looked like some weird vampire cult) and decided to grab a drink at the bar while we waited for our (reserved) table. This only took us around ten minutes, but I was already disappointed.  Their drink menu is pretty standard, focusing on lighter, fresh drinks that pair pretty well with the heavy menu.  I was very excited to see the English Garden came with "basil infused rock candy", having a sweet tooth and loving herbal drinks I thought this would be fun.  Unfortunately their 'rock candy' is actually a brand of simple syrup instead of actual rock candy.  I thought this was rather underhanded. Everyone reading the menu expects actual rock candy, and I watched another girl go through the same disappointment as she got her drink. . . Things just continued to go downhill as we were seated.  The restaurant is rather dim and loud as other reviewers pointed out, but also they are trying to apparently cram as many people as possible into the place.  Our table for two was crammed in with severalothers along a bench seat.  I could barely get in (and I'm on the small side) without worrying about jostling the table next to me.  Definitely ask to be seated in one of their booths if you have the option.  I was closer to the girl seated at the next table then my boyfriend at ours.   Along with the loud music this ruined any intimate atmosphere for the dinner. . . Our waiter was pretty decent, but pretty inattentive all around for this level of restaurant.  I also couldn't hear half of what he said, and it was too dark and our table not set up right for us to actually see anything on their famous wheeled mirror table to show off their meat 'tableside'  (it was actually directly behind my boyfriend who was the only one interested and he couldn't even see it without getting out of his seat).  They also are very strict about only having  a tasting menu for part of the table, which I suppose makes sense in theory, but less in actual practice.  . . That being said, even with me being as grumpy as I was as the meal started (I was trying to convince my boyfriend to leave), the food was phenomenal.  Everything from the delicious prosciutto bread starter (I could live off that alone for the rest of my life and be completely happy), to my beef wellington to my boyfriend's steak was absolutely perfect.  I could go on for paragraphs about the food, but I won't.  Don't come for the atmosphere, don't come for the drinks, but the food is amazing.  If you plan ahead (get a better table, skip the drinks and focus on the food), you will have a great experience.
The Steak was a great cut (bone-in ribeye - nice and marbled)  that was cooked to perfection! With not much gristle either - just a nice, thick cut of meat. . . After all the he hype on the beef Wellington, The table was split on whether to try it or not. None of us have had before and were intrigued. But after the knowledgeable waitress gave us her honest opinion we decided to order our own dishes and all split the Wellington 3 ways. I'm very glad we did that; the Wellington ended up being just "okay,"  almost like an overpriced empanada. Thanks to the waitress (if I can only remember her name)  for saving us from regret that night. . . All sides were awesome too, including fingerling potatoes, Ramsey's special mac&cheeze, and creamed corn (by far the best). . . No meal is complete without desert: we had the signature toffee pudding cake and French press coffee. The coffee was good but it did seem like they were trying to hard when they brought 3 chocolate covered spoons with different shots of liquor to add to your coffee. Didn't try any of them as I'm not a big fan of amaretto, bailey's or any other alcohol in my coffee.. . A quick suggestion if you're a wine drinker: bring your own bottle. The markup is atrocious (seriously, the $35 prisoner was listed at $120 and the $60 caymus was listed at $180, the caymus special reserve that normally goes for $130 was at an astonishing $340.
This wasn't one of my go-to restaurants on my list when I took a recent trip to Las Vegas. However, due to its namesake, my girlfriends (otherwise known as "foxpack" - yes, alluding to the infamous Hangover 1, 2, and 3 - primarily 1. Female version of "wolfpack") truly wanted to try this place out. I, the snooty foodie/social media snob, courteously obliged. . . And, whaddya know, gladly so!. . I was pleasantly impressed from beginning to end. Perhaps, because I didn't expect too much. The interior exudes "sexy" - red lighting, hot hostesses, the works. . . FOOD: . - Dry-Aged Bone-In Ribeye ($59) . so moist and juicy. If you're a steak lover, you'll love this - it's perfectly seared and cooked, with perfect marbling and beef flavor.. - Lobster Wellington . flaky pastry exterior, sealing a moist and properly-cooked lobster within. The Beef Wellington is their signature, but for seafood lovers, this was the perfect alternative. . - Mac & Cheese ($13) plus freshly-shaved truffles ($14 additional). best side ever. The mac & cheese was decadent, but not overbearing. It had the right amount and variation of cheeses to elevate the dish. The truffles took it over the edge. Each bite was bliss. . - Foie Gras Butter. Could've done without this sauce. It was much too heavy, and did not compliment the steak, as I assumed it would originally. . . COFFEE:. the coffee service really "wow-ed" me. When a latte was ordered by my friend, 3 beautiful chocolate-dipped tablespoons came out. Each spoon had a letter: A, B, and C. A stood for Amaretto, B for Bailey's, and C for Cognac. It was to flavor the coffee. I was blown. This was taking service to another level.. . While this isn't my favorite restaurant in the world, I would definitely be willing to go back upon another visit to Sin City.
Impressive. I had the most wonderful meal here that was in the top 5 of steak experiences. I got the onion soup which is the best onion soup I have ever had. Next up was the bread which was fantastic but I did not want to ruin dinner as it was a double baked potatoe and the American cap. Never had one before but based on recommendation from the wonderful woman sitting next to me at the bar and the bar tender I got it. WOW!!!
I haven't been here in a while but...everything here is awesome! Everything except the girls who worked in front of the restaurant (attitude much?) Hopefully this time around those girls will be gone. . . You have to try the sticky toffee pudding and sauteed mushroom appetizers, they're unbelievably delicious!. The H
My girlfriends came to celebrate my bachelorette party :) the service here is excellent, of course for the price, I would hope so! My sister and I shared the infamous beef Wellington, perfect size, great flavor. It was more amazing in person than on tv ;). I give it a 4-star as my girls got some decent steaks, but not my favorite. Also, another got hers medium rare, and it was gushing blood.... The first time, they said it was normal, but as she got closer to the center, it was literally rare and cool. Kinda killed that part of dinner as she waited for it to get cooked longer. We ended with the chocolate cake, which I'm typically not a fan of, and it was rich and delicious. I would come back, probably just for the Wellington :)
I emailed this review to a manager via Caesar's website, and received essentially no follow-up, other than "thanks for the feedback."  While I understand that there is no obligation to issue a credit/refund, an apology would have been appreciated, particularly as this was a dinner for a special event.
Locatedin Paris Hotel Casino on the Famous Las Vegas Strip. So I will start by saying that I think Mr. Ramsey is a bit of a bully, who is so critical of others food that his had best be impeccable. Close to impeccable but not as perfect as his insane tantrums would warrant. That being said everything is pretty great. I had the "Hell's Kitchen" seasonal price fix dinner. All was great, the beef wellington was just under great and a little disappointing as this is one of his signature dishes. I will say our server was great. I would also suggest that the signature cocktails have some more non gin options, I know it's supposed to British but how much nature boy can you get? Still worth a stop in for a special dinner. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
This dining experience did not disappoint!  From the amazing bread, to the famous Beef Wellington for 2!  The service is impeccable, food outstanding, and the atmosphere was beautiful.  The Wellington was tender enough to cut with a fork, and that is not an exaggeration!  We will be back, 5 stars+++, just go and enjoy the experience, you cant get it many places!
Friday night 8:00 reservation for 4 Nov 7th.. My new favorite Martini olive!  Blue cheese, onion and bacon! Yum!. Our dinner waiter was awful.  . First thing he asked was do you want drinks and since we all had drinks I said we don't want drinks. He handed me an IPad and I started looking for the dinner menu.. I ask where on the menu is the dinner menu and he tells me that the tablet is the drink menu.. He brings out the paper menu and I order two orders of bone marrow apps. he then tells me they don't have bone marrow apps and they have always been on the accompaniment menu. Then he tells me he can serve them as apps... I guess he wanted to show how knowledgeable he was.. whatever.. Anyway, I request fresh brioche to come out with the marrow. The brioche come out (cold) and ten minutes later the marrow comes out. . It comes time to order and I ask for the fattest rib-eye. He asked how I wanted it and I said 118 degree center. He looked at me like I was on Mars. Since he seemed confused and not happy with my precision, I said between rare and medium rare. He was not happy with that either and corrected me with "rare plus?". Sure.. My friend requested mayonnaise with the Asparagus side and the server said they didn't offer mayonnaise and he would like whatever sauce it was served with (my words).. My steak comes out at about 90 degree center.. full on rare.  Fluck. At this point I really don't care for this guy. Four minutes later he comes by to check and I tell him my steak is way too rare. He starts to explain about how steaks are prepared and I cut him off and tell him to stop talking and the next time I see him he should have my steak in his hand and done right.. It came back just fine but would have been better if it didn't have to be fired twice.. When the steak came back i asked the servers assistant for some mayo and he offered up some aioli with professionalism. . On to the food.. The bone marrow apps didn't have a lot of marrow in them. The last three times we were here they were done the way I do them. First pick the bones that are full and set aside the less full ones. These were the bones I would have tossed.. They were tasty, just not enough marrow. I only ordered two servings based on the size of the servings the last three times.. The Asparagus and Okra sides needed a bit more seasoning.. My friends rib-eye was perfect as well as the two beef wellingtons.
My 5th time dining here Sat, Nov 7th, and always a highlight of my trip to Las Vegas. I have in the past rated Gordon Ramsey Steak a 5 star.Not so on this night.. Our waiter Umberto was not great. Too much in my personal space when explaining things Arrogant and obnoxious.Music was way..way too loud. We couldn't talk at all. Hey, I love music, but just way over the top LOUD!. Food was average at best. Short ribs did not come as explained on menu. Side of fingerling potatoes were hard as marbles. Umberto came over to pour us more wine, but left us sitting there for 20 minutes with dirty plates in front of us without notifying bus boy to remove them. My Mother was furious, as we had invited friends to dine with us who had never been, and we were embarrassed. We just couldn't wait to get out of there! Asked if we wanted dessert, and we said no, but manager did send over 2 sticky toffee puddings on the house. Very nice gesture, but with all the new restaurants in Las Vegas, this will be a pass from now on. With the high prices, I expect superb service and food. In all fairness, we ate at the Pub the following night, and had a wonderful experience again there.
I lost all respect for Ramsey after I ate here with my husband late night. For a man known for saving restaurants he can't even take care of serving good food in his own restaurant! We ordered fisher's man grill - $49.95 the plate was VERY small. That's fine with fine dining small portions, but I expected that each piece of item presented should be of top quality. BUT.... . Lobster- small tail tasteless, over cooked. Mussels- 2 on the plate were the size of raisins. Salmon- taste fishy. Tuna- tasteless. Scallops - 1 piece on the plate ( good). . Side of spinach - $12. This is acceptable . . Would never go back again.. . No wonder most of the restaurants he help failed a year or 2 after he left. He can't even take care of his own restaurant. If you have a failing restaurant, just close it. Don't be a joker on his show.
As far as steakhouses go, this one won't fail to impress if you're visiting Vegas. I've been watching Gordon Ramsay shows for years, so I was very curious what standard he holds for his own places. I've been to a few other "celebrity" chef restaurants in the past that have been a pretty big disappointment, but this was very good. To some, rolling out a cart of uncooked steaks showing you options might be off-putting, but I loved it. The server convinced me to try the Rib Cap and I'm not sure I've had a better cut of beef. . . I only have to knock it down for the atmosphere, I know this is Vegas, but I was hoping for a more quiet spot. The vibe was very much like a Vegas night club and it was a bit difficult to concentrate. Definitely took away from the tasty meal.
I have loved Gordan Ramsey from the first episode I saw of Kitchen Nightmares on the BBC.  So it was obvious that when I was in Vegas for my sister's wedding, I had to go here. . . I made reservations online about 2 months in advance for myself, boyfriend, and another couple who shares the love for Ramsey also! That was quick and easy! . . We arrived at 7 and we're brought right to our table. The hosts were super friendly and ours told us a little about the restaurant and decor. . . Our waiter arrived and he was amazing! Seriously top notch service, which should be at a place like this, but I had never had this type of experience. He was so funny and knowledgeable and gave us the perfect amount of time to decide what we want. He also brought over the cool meat tray so we could see the meats they have to offer. We ordered the kobe beef sliders, crispy pork belly, and foie gras for appetizers. Everything was delicious as expected. The foie gras was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. I was hesitant to try it at first but it is so so flavorful and delicious! If there is one appetizer you try make it this! . . For dinner I ordered the filet, my boyfriend had the beef short rip, and the other couple ordered the seafood mix and porterhouse steak. We ordered fingerling potatoes and truffle Mac for sides. Everyone ate every last bit! Steak was cooked perfectly and was so delicious! . . For dessert we both had the sticky toffee pudding. OMG can I just eat this 24/7? Gooey, chocolate, crunchy, melty, everything you dream of goodness! . . I hope I can come back here next time I'm in Vegas, if for nothing else the dessert! Totally worth the price and the experience was great! Overall the dinner took 3 hours, which is sort of crazy, but was well worth it.
Very disappointed!  Will start out with my only positive...our waiter was very good and he knew his stuff...too bad the food didn't match his ability...I had to literally try to saw the meat to get a piece off the steak (rib eye)...had to go to a show so no time to ask for another one.  Worst steak I have had in many many years.  Also the seating could have been better...tables literally on top of each other...my wife's birthday and not much chance to carry on a conversation without the people on both sides of us knowing what we were saying.  Won't be back!
Caesar salad with scotch egg. American rib cap. Bone in rib eye. Asparagus. Mac and cheese. . HK antioxidant cocktail. . Sticky toffee with brown butter ice cream. . Five stars straight up.  The ONLY thing I would comment on is that the mac & cheese was a bit heavy-handed with the the truffle oil - making it incredibly rich.  Couldn't eat a lot of it.  Other than that... one of the best meals I've had in my many years going to Vegas. . . OK, the only OTHER thing I would comment on - being a huge fan of Hell's Kitchen, it was disappointing to learn that I couldn't order their special HK menu unless our entire table ordered the same thing.  Don't think I'll ever get to try it.
If there was an option for it, I can give it a 4 and half stars rating. This restaurant has almost everything going for it; the look, the vibe, the quality staff and the amazing dishes but it's still missing something. Can't quite grasp what it is. The drinks are awesome here, especially the sidecar, perfect balance of Hennessey and Cointreau. The blue crab soup was really good. The cold shrimp appetizer wasn't that good. Wish we hadn't  ordered that. However, Gordon Ramsay's famous Wellington lives up to it's expectations. The hype is real !
I eat out a lot. I don't watch tv but I know Gordon is famous so I was not sure if this place would be just hype. I had the ribeye and holy shit I was blown away. Delicious. This place is worth it's own trip to Vegas. The dinner with 2 drinks for each of us in party of 3 with 3 steaks and some vegi sides was $500 but well deserved. The server was fantastic. The service exceptional. I'm sold. I can wait to go back here again and bring friends.
By far the best quality I have had. Definitely met my expectations being a gordon Ramsey restaurant. We had a party of 12 and all ordered some type of cut ranging from the rib eye, porterhouse, etc. everyone was quite pleased and cooked to perfection.
In my opinion this place is overhyped because of the name attached to it. My issue(s) with this place: as have been echoed by many other reviews, the atmosphere is not what you expect for a $50 (minimum) a plate kind of place. The service was clearly catered to larger parties, such as the loud one of 11+ sitting in the same room as us. There were times when we would ask for water to have to wait until a new person walked by and we could stop them and ask for some water. The food was good, but nothing to write home to your mom about. I enjoyed by chicken (know that if you order it there is a 40 minute cooking wait time) but some of it was too" decadent". Rich with too many flavors at points as if the chef was really trying to show off how to use truffle oil crunchy crap and what not. I do have to say that the hostesses were nice. I just really wish someone would have asked the party sitting next to us to lower their volumes especially when one of them started to get vulgar
I went into this dinner with high expectations and sadly they we not met. Don't get me wrong the food was amazing but it just didn't live up to the hype.. . The only reason why I'm not rating it 3 stars is because of the amazing waitress we had that night. She was sincere with her suggestions, witty and just an absolute doll the whole night. She really made the dinner experience great. With that said, now the reason why I would have given it 3 stars.. . The beef Wellington was talked up by many reviews and it was in my sights before I arrived. While I was there I asked many questions about the dish and received a luke warm response. Once the meat tray, yes the meat tray came out with raw cuts of beef for you to choose, modeled by a Vanna White like waitress, I bailed on the Beef Wellington. . . I instead opted for the American Rib Cap that was simply one of the most tender cuts of beef I have tried. It wasn't over powered by seasoning allowing the true taste of the cut to come through. Like any respectable red blooded meat lover should order their steak, I of course went medium rare. This cut can be compared to a skirt/flank steak, just a high end version of it. This is where I run into a problem, sure it's a great cut of beef but that's it. It's not something I would expect from chef "Ramsey the Great" in all his glory.  His name may be on the restaurant but he's not cooking the meal. . . You might be thinking I may be harsh but that is hardly the case my dear sir or madam. I have eaten at the Pub by Ramsey which was ehhh. Also near by Burgr which is hands down UH-Mazing!!! I am an avid foodie especially in Vegas eating on and off the strip. Dives and high end swanky places as well. That is why I can say objectively I was not impressed. . . I also had three sides. Mac & Cheese, Fingerling Potatoes and Bourbon Cream Corn. The corn hands down was the best out of the three. It even out shined the steak. Yea I said it and what?! . . Finally, I finished my meal with what I have to describe as a life altering experience... Sticky Toffee Pudding.  The moistness throughout the cake, the presentation, THA sauce... Tha Sauce... It was perfection through every single bite. It simply just melted in your mouth and made me forget in that moment that I most likely wouldn't dine here again. . . Was the food bad? No, it was great! Was it over priced? Absolutely without a doubt for the quality I received.  You may be thinking I'm your everyday cheapo but think again. I have spent much more for a meal than I did at "Steak" but it was worth every penny. Here I simply was cheated out of my money as many are in the casinos. . . By the way, our dinner party split the Beef Wellington and it wasn't even edible. It was an over-priced and poorly made empanada (Latin American stuff pastry).  Granted I was warned about it but I couldn't shake the curiosity. In my case, curiosity killed this cat... If you are looking for an amazing steak, check out my other reviews. . . My concluding thoughts. If an establishment has a celebrity name attached to it, it doesn't guarantee an amazing meal.  Remember sometimes it's all smoke and mirrors what we see on TV.
I did not even eat here and still I am more impressed with this restaurant than any other. Do you want to know why? I came to the front of "Steak" around 11:30 on a Wednesday morning hoping to treat myself to a good lunch. When I approached the hostess she informed me that they were only open for dinner. I asked her if she had any recommendations for a good lunch and she unbiasedly suggested a French restaurant nearby. As I walked away I thought to myself, "What a classy joint this must be to pay a hostess to stand outside of a restaurant while they're not even open to help customers before they even come to eat. Leave it to a Gordon Ramsay establishment! A+.
We had such an amazing time. The restaurant decor had a modern look. The food was delicious. For starters they gave us, 3 different types of breads and they were delicious. We started off with oysters. They were from new york, Chicago and Washington. I'm not a big oyster person but these were so fresh and exceptional. My husband had the beef Wellington and I had the beef short ribs. The beef Wellington was so tender that it was cooked to perfection and my ribs were so soft that no knife was needed to cut the meat and the sauce was so good that I wanted to lick the plate. For dessert we had a sticky toffee cake and it was to die for. It was warm and sweet and the slice of ice cream balance the sweetness of the cake. I would definitely recommend  and go back to this restaurant when we return to Vegas!
Maine lobster app - three incredible bites.. Beef Wellington main. - tender meat, cooked to perfection, needed salt.. Wife had salmon main - excellent piece of fish, flaky, well seasoned.. Music way too loud. Prices way too high. Did not meet hype.
Pretty hard four star restaurant in my opinion, taking into account that this is THE, Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The food was good, but I'll just go down a quick list of things I took notice of. . . First, the attire for the hostesses was very tacky for a restaurant in my opinion... Especially a classy one like this place. When we arrived for our reservation, we were sent into the bar area to aimlessly await someone to seat us. Inside this place a beautiful. We were seated in this massive booth upstairs which overlooks the downstairs seating area. The waitress arrived in a very classy/cute outfit and also had a helper which was nice.... Kind of like having two people wait on you.. . We were served a variety of complimentary breads to start things off. All of them were wonderful and done very well. I almost felt like asking for seconds.. . Our waitress presented us with a custom made cart which was arranged with all the different cuts of beef they serve. We chose to stick with the tried and very true Bone-in Ribeye (med rare), a loaded baked potato side, asparagus and to start the meal... A French onion soup. . . The French onion soup was delicious. I couldn't exactly taste the cheese and there wasn't a crunchy top layer.. But the soup flavors were great and this probably falls into my top two onion soups... The first being Papillon in Fremont Ca. If Gordon Ramsay gave this more of a gooey cheesy top layer with fried bits.. It may beat the best (so far in my experience at least).. . The steak arrived pre-cut and perfectly cooked. I don't get the pre-cut... But it didn't bother me and still tasted amazing. Aged to perfection and had great marbleization. Juicy, tender and thick. I like to gnaw on my ribeye bones so I went to town on that too. A good steak doesn't need anything to compliment it. Just meat and a perfect caramelization.. . The loaded baked is large but wasn't done the best. It came with a sort of country gravy which I didn't care for. No chives, no sour creme and I don't think it even had cheese... But I may be wrong. The worst part for me was that the outside wasn't salty and crunchy how I enjoy my baked potatoes. If I knew this, I would have opted for a different side.. . The asparagus was perfectly cooked... But lacked much flavor besides the flavor of asparagus... Which is fine if that's all you really want. I like mine with a roasted/grill flavor or at least some garlic and seasonings, so that would have been nice.. . Of course our meal wasn't complete without a dessert. we ordered the Coconut Cake which had pineapple and passion fruit-guava sorbet. This dish was very nicely done! Light, flavorful, not too sweet and unique. I definitely recommend trying it.. . Overall our experience was good. The ambiance was nice, the food was good, the steak was even better and I would not hesitate at spending $150 for another steak dinner here at Gordon Ramsays Steak.
LOVED dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak! Terrific assortment of breads! I indulged in only one: the roll with pancetta that was delicious!  I had pre-planned my meal, and every dish that I ordered was a winner. I started with the seared foie gras with herbed goat cheese popovers that was a very generous portion of foie gras perfectly prepared. I had the American rib cap that was even better than what I have had at Per Se! 8 oz. is a perfect size. No additional sauce was needed. I had pommes puree that were lovely. I ended my meal with the stellar sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream that was amazing for flavor and aroma! Service was very friendly and attentive. Will definitely return to Gordon Ramsay Steak!
If this review was solely based on the mac & cheese then it would easily receive my five stars. Unfortunately, that is not the case and it is difficult to get five stars out of me (unless bribed--just kidding, kind of.) I firmly believe that the dining experience cannot solely be based on the food alone.  It is about the energy, the ambience, style, timeliness, service, the quality of the ingredients used, and the food itself. Overall, Gordon Ramsay lived up to each of these which is why if asked if I would eat here again, my answer would be a resounding YES!
I LOVE this place. The food is really good.. I've eaten here twice. Once in bar, once in dining room.. Would give 5 stars but music is too loud. I really don't get that.. Corkage was $35 but they want to know what you are bringing (maybe if it's on their list they want you to buy theirs. It wasn't). . Suggest you always order  different entrees so you can sample each others. We made the mistake of ordering the Wellington for 2 the first time, but now we'll just keep going back until we try everything. . Don't order too many apps. They are big enough to share. The baked potato is GIANT. I got it for my vegetarian daughter and she ate 1/4 of it.. . Sticky toffee pudding is a must try. We didn't get it the second time because we over ordered on apps.. . Next time I want to try a steak, but COME ON, 32 oz? Was I drunk when I read that?. Probably.. Vegas Baby
We were first seated at the 2-top at the top of stairs next to the bussing station and where every meal comes in and out of the kitchen.  We waited 10-15 minutes for service, and asked to be reseated.  We were kindly reseated next to the wine closet in the back corner downstairs.  Every time they needed to serve a bottle of lower-priced wine (high priced wine is stored elsewhere) somebody came and put their butt in our face as they opened the closet to get wine out.  It's not really a closet -- it's a double-deep fancy glass door case, by the way.. . Anyway, we waited another 10-15 minutes for service.  We ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing -- $220 a pop.  First few courses were mediocre.  Beef Wellington was awesome and the dessert was awesome.. . Overall -- not worth the price.  Good, but not great.  And certainly not a $500 dinner for two given the service and complete lack of ambience.
I think I may have found my favorite steakhouse in Vegas, so far. We booked about a month ahead for reservations. When we arrived,we got seated upstairs.  I liked the entrance of the restaurant. The downstairs is more lively than the upstairs. We got seated upstairs and although it is quieter and more private it's nice to be in the action of the restaurant sometimes. But for a large group it might be nice having your own space upstairs. I enjoyed the meat cart, but it makes it hard for indecisive people like myself. We got the porterhouse for 2 and it was perfect. It was precut and that would bother some people, but not me. Someone in our party got beef Wellington, it was good but I enjoy the steak. Loaded baked potato, Mac and cheese, and creamed spinach. The sides were excellent. For dessert was Sticky toffee pudding with vanilla bean ice cream that looks like butter. Great presentation with the knife through the "butter." Service was on point. Expensive $$$ but if my hubby wants to take me here for a special occasion, I won't say no.
As a Ramsay fan..... This place was like heaven; however it's quite hard to make reservations. We were lucky that we walked in randomly and got a seat. . . Before you order, waitresses bring iPads to show pretty photos of drinks and interesting gifts of Ramsay that you can purchase .. . Fur gras (best I ever had ) . Beef willington (even though it takes 90 minutes to prepare, it's so worth it. It melted on my teeth) . Stick pudding (another must have).  South side drink was quite good ( ask them about the story behind the spoon in the drink) . . . Service was amazing. I got shiitake mushroom and potato as sides, they were wayyyyyyyyyyy too salty. When the waitress asked if everything was alright I didn't want to complain. All I said was how it was good but a lil on the salty side .The minute after the manager came over and replaced the salty ones with freshly made new plates that is perfectly seasoned . Super impressive
This is the best steak I have ever had in my life and I felt compelled to add a review based off of what some of the other reviewers have wrote here. Some people have said the food was so bad that they cried from sadness? What? I feel sorry for anyone who tasted this meal and had tears of sadness forming from it. That is ridiculous and absolutely not true. There were also some statements that after their horrible meal they went down stairs and ordered pizza instead. My god people get off your high horses and just enjoy a well crafted meal. The rib cap was amazing! Highly recommended. The beef Wellington was also a favorite of mine as welll. Mix in some Mac and cheese with a baked potato and you have a glorious meal to dig in on. Wine was reasonably priced and I absolutely got my monies worth. Will be back and again, best steak ever.
Even with all the hype this place has, it was just "ehhh" for me. I ordered the King Crab appetizer, which was tiny and really bland. The Oysters were nothing special; not bad, just nothing special. The Beef Tartare was also just OK. The Mac n Cheese and Potato Puree were both really good side dishes.. . For entrees we ordered the Bone In Ribeye and the Beef Wellington. I'm not sure what a Beef Wellington is supposed to taste like, but what we were served, I was not a fan of. The Ribeye, however, was tasty and cooked very well.. . Another negative was the location of our table. We were sat directly behind the kitchen line where their staff was constantly joking, laughing, and overall being really loud. It was tough to keep a conversation when you had six or seven guys screaming throughout our meal.. . What saved the meal for me was the Sticky Toffee dessert. I'm not a dessert guy, but I would absolutely go back just for this and a beer to wash it down. It's a complex combination of flavors and textures that I've never really tasted before. Major WOW factor.. . To me, Gordon Ramsay Steak is a good, but not great restaurant. There were a lot of positives, but too many negatives for me to rate this any higher.
Being Ramsey fans my husband & I had to go here when we were on honeymoon in Vegas.  This place did not disappoint.  It was all we imagined & more. We had the beef sliders, Beef Wellington, sea bass, mac & cheese,  & creamed corn. Evening was delish!  It was a splurge that was well worth it.
We celebrated our Anniversary at Gordon Ramsay this past Wednesday 11/19.  This was a huge splurge for us and so our expectations were pretty high.  We stayed at the Paris Hotel and so it was super convenient.  The hostesses were great!  We chatted with them the night before and so upon arrival they remembered us, gave  us compliments and made entering more inviting.   The hostess that seated us, shared With us that the funky cool neon chandelier represents Gordon Ramsays hand movements while making the beef Wellington.  Cool little fact.  Any way, once seated we were then greeted with the servers assistant, he made sure everything was properly set up, waters stayed full, etc.  we then met our waiter Dennis!  He is fantastic!!!  We were offered an iPad of drinks that are designed to cleanse the palate!  Yummy and refreshing!  Then came time to start ordering!  We started with the kurobuta pork belly and  the Hudson valley foie gras.  Both were delicious!!!!  The foie gras melts in your mouth and the little goat cheese pop overs were the absolute best!!  We were also served the bread.  I don't eat bread but the little onion swirly roll was so flakey and the butter with volcanic sea salt... Dang good!  Our main course was a tough decision.  This is where our server really impressed me.  While feeling inclined to order the  beef Wellington since it's a popular dish he made the deciding factor easy... "do you want a steak that's been baked or seared". Love the honesty.  We both ordered the highly recommended beef cap.  Best piece if meat I've ever had!  We Aldo ordered more foie gras, asparagus, ginger shiitakes, and bone marrow .  All were fabulous but the bone marrow was not good... At all :(  we ended our night with sticky toffee pudding like everyone else!  We never ever order desert... It's the best stuff!!!   We had a fabulous time!!!!
The food and service was great, we went on vacation last week...we had the Beef Wellington and it was good, service was great...the house is from front to back like I would expect from Gordon...like clock work...I would recommend not Beef Wellington...go with the real steaks...the tables  next to us raved...Beef Wellington was good but I realized the reason I never order this is I like grilled meat!  Sides were great and we had really great bottle of wine...I want to be the Sommelier here..just saying, he has spot on and a great recommendation for us!
Gordon Ramsay, you've set up an awesome establishment! . . The food is bomb.com. The service is bomb.com. The ambience is bomb.com. And did I mention the food is bomb.com? . . Your Beef Wellington lived up to the hype! Awesome!
This was by far the pinnacle of my dining experiences so far. We ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was very different from the norm but delicious and refreshing with the cucumber cocktail sauce. The shrimp were huge and meaty. We also ordered the American filet and the wellington. My friend likes her steak well done and even at that the filet was cooked so well that you could cut it with a fork. The wellington was delicious. The only thing I would do differently next time is for a light touch on the truffles. We split the mac and cheese as a side and, while it was very different, it was delicious.  The service was stellar. Our waiter Anthony took care of our every need and was so patient and knowledgeable about the menu. This was serious the best dining experience I've ever had. Money well spent and I'm glad I did it.
Atmosphere: The hostesses were dressed in skin tight black dresses, and the wait staff wore white button downs with tucked in ties. Their attire wasn't my favorite; but hey, I didn't have to wear it so rock on, Gordon Ramsay Steak staff! The guests' attire was quite varied, even for Las Vegas - everything from jeans and t-shirts to cocktail attire was on display. . . The decor of the restaurant was very unique and sleek. You enter through a cylindrical tube and are immediately dumped into the bar area. Red is vibrantly featured throughout the restaurant, capped off with a custom humongous light fixture that was inspired by the knife strokes of Gordon Ramsay. Our hostess pointed this out while seating us, which I thought was an interesting and fun fact. . . As we passed through the first floor and the front of the second floor, I couldn't help but notice how incredibly loud the restaurant was. Luckily we were seated towards the back of the second floor, so we were able to talk during dinner. . . Service: Wow. Wow. Wow! Yarmon was hands down one of the best servers we have ever had in any restaurant. He was funny, helpful, extremely nice, knowledgeable, and attentive without being overbearing. I can't say enough nice things about him. He truly enhanced our dining experience! . . Food: We each ordered the American rib cap and it was delicious. We shared the mac & cheese and fingerling potatoes as our sides, and both were excellent. The food was outstanding! We asked for recommendations and details on drinks, and again Yarmon delivered. . . Overall, this was one of the best meals and dining experiences we have had. It will definitely be added to my list of must-visit restaurants for returns to Vegas!
Our favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas. As locals we are hard to impress but
Very nice restaurant, flawless service, excellent cocktails.. Most of the table had different types of steaks and sides after getting full explanation/demo of the steak display.. Sommelier has excellent suggestion for the wine based on our preferences and order.. Everyone raved about the crab soup.. One not-so-trivial problem: the steak knives were pretty but useless.  They were chosen because of how they looked, not for their function: Too slender for an adult's hand, trying to balance on the plate between bites usually fell on floor, and not sharp enough to properly cut.
My prejudice against celebrity chef restaurants is that they're good enough, but way too expensive for what you're getting. After all, you're paying for the name, right?  Well, I was happy to be proven wrong at Gordon Ramsay Steak.. . First, the prices are about the same as any other fine steakhouse on the Strip (granted, most of those are celeb chef joints as well).  But in light of the quality of the food, service, and experience, I thought GRS was actually pretty darn reasonable.  We started with the seared foie gras app, which I order almost everywhere it's offered.  The GRS version is a goat-cheese-stuffed popover and apricot sauce with the seared foie - altogether simply amazing.  Then we split the Beef Wellington for two (a bargain at just a hundred bucks), and after the first bite I understood why this is the GRS signature dish.  The duxelle, prosciutto, and puff pastry really enhance the flavor of the meat, which was the most tender tenderloin I've ever had (and I've eaten at a LOT of steakhouses).  We also split the asparagus side dish, totally fresh and yummy.  My dinner companion was slightly disappointed by the signature dessert, the sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream, but I thought it was amazing, every bit as good as advertised.  I had the peanut butter chocolate crunch, which was drop-dead awesome (and I don't even like chocolate!).. . The service was first-rate, always attentive, very well-informed (knew every detail of the menu like the back of their hand), and didn't even blink when I asked for a weird check split (I agreed to pay for the alcohol, my dinner companion paid for the food).  The only downer was that I didn't much care for the interior of the place.  I read about the Chunnel-themed entrance that cost an arm & a leg to build, but it didn't look nearly as cool as it did in photos.  I also thought the music was a bit loud; it made conversation a bit difficult.  But the food and service were so top-notch that those are minor quibbles.  I would definitely go back to Gordon Ramsay Steak again (and again).
Dined before la reve at Wynn. Service was above average and extremely professional, but had lengthy wait for quick desert and bill. . . All food met and exceeded expectations. Caesar salad & octopus for apps. Both amazing. Very simple Caesar with amazing flavor and perfect dressing. . . Filet and Wellington for entree. Both cooked perfectly and most likely best steak to date. . . We went right at 430 when opened. Recommend a later reservation. If bottled water service is not important to you, request tap and have an extra martini.  Great, great dinner - just not 5 star wow.
Hello everyone sow my girlfriend and I had to visit this steakhouse located in Paris hotel and casino. I must say when I walked in past the doorways the place looked magnificent. I loved the modern look that it had when you got past the tunnel. The lights in the center of the restaurant were pretty cool and what the lights represented were cool too.. . TIP!!!! Now first things first! For all of you new people who are going to dine here for the first time. When they ask you if you want Still or Sparkling water keep in mind BOTH cost money. If you want free water like myself then ask for TAP water! Or your going to be charged!. . Now that that is out of the way onto the food! I ordered the rib eye cooked medium. And when it came out it looked great and was cooked to how it was supposed to be cooked. The only complaint I had was a small portion of my steak was seared a bit too much so the crust was very hard.. . My girlfriend got a filet cut which was very tender but the center was about a medium rare compared to the medium that she ordered. But it was very tender and flavorful and in my opinion was better than my rib eye.. . We also ordered two sides. The pureed mashed potatoes which were creamy and delicious and the asparagus which were cooked very nicely.. . I honestly did like the restaurant but I feel there are other steakhouses that can beat this one. . . Have fun!
Gonna keep this short and simple. . When you first sit down, if you don't want to pay for water - ASK for TAP WATER.  Their still / mineral water both costs money.. . We got the gnocchi -. the flavors were amazing.  It was fun eating them all together and then piece by piece to figure out how the flavors complement each other.. . The breads (FREE) -. holy crap... I loved all their different breads.  The truffle one and cheddar one is to die for.  Nice flaky and SAVORY.. . Beef Wellington (for 2) . - you get 2 individual plates, it's just a larger beef wellington cut in half.  The filet mignon was soooo tender and the puff pastry and duxelle was amazing.  I kept closing my eyes when I was eating it because I was just so absorbed in it.  I think my date was somewhat annoyed at me but I couldn't help it.. . As for food, that was plenty.  I'm the type of person who almost always get the buffet passes at vegas cuz it's actually worth it for me.  I was stuffed at the end of this meal - no desserts.   . . The service is top-notch.  My date left her lapkin (i call it a lapkin cuz it's on your lap) messy on the table when she went to go to the restroom and the guy freakin comes and folds it up nicely and puts it back.  My water was CONSTANTLY filled.  They also did it in a way where it wasnt intruding.  I've been to a couple fancy expensive places but Gordon Ramsay really has these guys working hard.
High expectations only met with the sticky toffee pudding cake and coffee press with chocolate spoons. The filet was 'okay', the fish and chips had skin on the fish along with French fries. Strange Gordon dish.  The macaroni and cheese was good. We had fabulous a great time with our friends but the meal did not meet our expectations.
Gordon Ramsay Steak has ruined all other restaurants for me. The restaurant was so sexy and classy at the same time. The hot waitresses wore tight black minidresses and the waiters were dressed well too. My date and I arrived for our reservation and we were seated very quickly. The waitress walked us to our table and on the way, told us how the light fixture on the ceiling was inspired by Ramsay's hand movements when preparing his signature dish. The waitress seated us and placed the napkins on our laps for us. Then our waiter came with the menus and explained some of the drinks and food. We ordered the Beef Carpaccio, Beef Wellington, Beef Short Rib, and Fingerling Potatoes on the side. As we waited for our food, our waiter came by with a cart of raw beef and showed us the different cuts they served.. . The bread was really goo. There were three kinds of bread. My favorite was the mushroom-truffle. It came out warm and was incredibly soft. Even the butter topped with some kind of black-colored salt was amazing.. . The Beef Carpaccio came on a plate with the beef resting on top of a halved bone with some small salad on top. It was to die for, but I was sad that the portion was so little.. . The Beef Wellington was cooked perfectly. It was so tender and not dry at all! You could really taste the meat and the texture just made it more enjoying to eat.. . The Beef Short Rib was braised with red wine and came off the bone with little effort. The meat was perfect and a little fatty. It was so good!. . The Fingerling Potatoes were cute. The truffle really made this dish. I would probably try a different side unless you love potatoes. I'm not crazy about potatoes but this side was good.. . For dessert, we ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding. I loved it so much! The butter ice cream was incredible and the toffee pudding was like heaven in my mouth. The Sticky Toffee Pudding was what I really waited months to come here for and it did not disappoint! It was big! I suggest sharing this unless you have a lot of room for dessert!. . The service was absolutely perfect and the food was wonderful. Every time we got up to go to the restroom, one of the staff would come and refold our napkin. We were checked up on at the right times. Our water would be refilled quickly without asking. After every dish was brought out, all our plates and utensils were replaced with new ones. The waiter even cleaned away crumbs on the table as we waited for our next dish. I felt as though they were watching us eat because how could they know exactly when to come to our table and do these little things for us without us ever asking? It may sound creepy but they have spoiled me!
There's a reason that I visit Gordon Ramsay's restaurants whenever visit London or Las Vegas.  You are guaranteed a fantastic experience.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen tasting menu and it was out of this world.  The service, incredible.  Victor (or was it Viktor?) delivered some of the best service I've ever had.  . . Here's my favorite aspect about the service at Chef Ramsay's establishments that I love (and this goes for all of the help, including the sommeliers as well):  They adapt very quickly to what YOUR mood is.  If you're feeling chatty and casual they open up and chat a bit more when visiting the table.  Feeling private or reclusive, they deliver and pick up silently and only engage when they need to ask a question.  Whatever the mood, they always deliver the same impeccable service.  You never go hungry or thirsty, you make eye contact with anyone (literally anyone) working in the restaurant and they will help you immediately.
I've been wanting to visit Gordon's Restaurant for a while.  It was amazing from start to finish.  I like the way the hostess walks you through the restaurant explaining things all the way to your seat.  Then the meat trolley comes out to your table.  You get to select which cut of meat you want.  I wanted them all ~!!  Me and my wife have eaten at every upscale Steakhouse in Vegas, L.A. and Orange County and this is the best steak house hands down.  So if you're in Vegas and not a cheap ass; " cause you always get what you pay for then be sure to stop buy this gem~!! "   Our waiter Matt gave us amazing service and even brought me a cheese platter that wasn't on the menu.  The Beef Wellingtons are so Amazing ~!!  Desert and drinks were too~!!   After dinner you can hang out at the very posh bar.  Good drinks and a hot girl bartender and we closed the night out in this spot ~!!  Looking forward to our next visit~!!
