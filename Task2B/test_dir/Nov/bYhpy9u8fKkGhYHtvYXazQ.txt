I gave them 2 stars because they really fell off my expectations. I have been here many time, dined in almost all the restaurants and I have good experience, but staying here is a total different story. . . My first night has no heat. I called front desk and they sent an "engineer" to fix it and it took him almost an hour. He said he fixed it but after he left I found out there was still no heat. I called front desk again and they wants to send another engineer. It was 4:30am! They offered me to remove my resort fee but it appeared on my final bill and I have to talk them through. . . Not to mention the hotel rooms are old. You are better off to stay at Venetian.
Welp. This place was terrible. Checked in to one hotel room and the room was still dirty from the last tennants. Called down and asked to change rooms and they obliged. Went back down and got the room changed they lady lets us know that she's going to upgrade our room but it will be s bit noisier because of the fountains and overlooking the pool. Sure. We get to the room and the tub faucet leaks, the mini fridge smelled like something died in it. And we can hear some kind of noise from above us. Oh well I guess we'll make it work. Well it's night one down and if I didn't have to move everything I would have moved hotels this morning. You can hear everything in the halls clear as day. Woke up 4 times throughout the night by people talking. I recommend staying in an upgraded room or a completely different hotel. This place stunk!
After being to the real city of lights I can say this place is a total replica of the real city!. It is beautiful on the inside! . . The eiffel tower on the outside is 1/2 the size of the real one.  The designers wanted it to be an exact replica, but its proximity to the airport prevented that from happening.. . We had two meals at the Sugar Factory at Paris and both were awesome!. Very fun place - get the groupon for it!
Our reservation got messed up, we reserved adjoining rooms and when we went to check in, none were available, so we got a free upgrade, which was very nice. The room looked pretty good, but we did find a pair of socks left over from a previous guest, they were hidden pretty well, we would have never noticed them if we hadn't been looking for the remote for the TV. We never found the remote, had to get one sent up, which was taken care of very quickly.  Besides the socks the room was in great order, and they took great care of us. Check in and out were both very easy.
We were here for the Marine Corps Ball and we loved our suite. It was a big room with a fantastic bathroom and a jacuzzi! We definitely got our money worth.
For a "4 star" resort this place sucks. Rooms sucked. Casino floor sucks. Resort fees suck. Sugar sucks...the food was awful! And those big $35 drinks that have "8 to 10" shots...sucked. The 8 to . 10 includes liqueurs...boo! Shame on Paris for charging hefty prices and failing miserably when it comes to quality and entertainment.
Stayed here for 4 nights while we were in Vegas. Got a really good advance deal on Expedia. When we arrived got given a remodeled room on the 30th floor facing the strip. Small wait for check-in but nothing like what I was expecting - maybe 10min tops. Room was great. Service from staff was good - can't expect much from a place that holds multiple thousands of people at a time. . . The location is amazing though. I'd stay here again just for this. Right in the centre of the strip - just where you want to be.
I stayed the night of 11/13 for a conference being held at the resort. I had stayed at the hotel a while ago so kind of knew what to expect. . Hotel/Location: This hotel is located in the middle of the strip. Walking distance to City Center, Bellagio, and Caesars. Although it is getting old, it still has a cool vibe with the whole Paris theme. The casino is pretty small but then again, it doesn't take too long to get anywhere. . Check-in: I arrived early for conference and was told my room was not available. I could check in online at 11:00am for $20. I did but wasn't called until 11:40am to pick up my key. However, my friend arrived at 11:15 and was given a room without having to pay $20. This does not seem fair. I had left my bags with the bellman. As I was heading upstairs, I called them to deliver my luggage and it arrived right as I got to the room.. Room: I got a premium room overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. I like the fact that the room elevators were not that far from the main casino entrance. There is only one wing so getting to your room was fairly quick. The room was a good size with a couch (not pullout). The TV was in an awkward position hanging on the wall instead of in the Cabinet that was right next to it. The bathroom was very plain. Shower pressure was kind of poor. Bathroom amenities were basic. The closet was in between the bathroom and across from a desk. It was awkward because when you open the closet doors it blocked your entrance into the bathroom. The bed was of average comfort level. Wifi offered with the resort fee was on the slow side.. Amenities: I utilized the spa (see my review) and workout facility. The workout room is located in the spa and is open at 6am. Kind of wished I could have gotten in earlier. But there are decent amounts of free weights and workout things. The spa was also decent. The workout and spa facility are part of the resort fee. So good value there. . If you are on a budget and want a hotel in a good location, then Paris is a good choice.
i have stayed here twice before and its very nice and conveniently located to all the action on the strip they have good staff a nice nightclub and i enjoyed ny sray very much.
The common areas (Casino, restaurants, etc) are really nice, but Motel 6 has better rooms. We stayed in a basic room at about $200 per night. The carpet was stained, the furniture was broken, the refrigerator was old and loud. Our view was of the rooftop of the shopping area below (but it was a basic room, so a great view wasn't expected).  The worst part was that the houskeeping room was right next door to us, so every morning at about 8:00, they started talking loudly in the room next door, and outside our room door, and banging their carts along the wall on the way out. Normally, 8 AM isn't too early for me, but in Vegas, the nights are longer, so it would be nice to sleep in a little. Even if I wasn't sleeping, I don't want to hear the houskeepers yelling up and down the hall from right outside my door. If I was rating the holel alone, it would be one star.
Everything was good till it was time to check out. I stood in line for 30 minutes just to turn in my key and get a receipt
The price was what made this hotel so attractive. The idea of something based off of Paris seemed cool too. . . The facts:. . The place does look cool on the inside with the fake sky, etc., but the rooms themselves were so-so at best. Pillows were ridiculously uncomfortable. . . The casino floor seemed small for the size of the hotel itself.. . GREAT location though! Nice and centrally located on the strip. . . Overall my experience wasn't horrible or anything. I did find myself only spending time in this hotel to sleep though. I definitely spent more time in other hotels that were close by.
This is a tough call.  We really wanted to love this hotel, but it was just ok... My rating is more 3.5 stars but I'll bump it up to be nice!  Our room was not right upon arrival, but it could be to the fact that our flight was delayed and it was 1am when we checked in.  I highly recommend getting an upgrade (which we did pay for and got the following day).  The original rooms are dated...  Like the little couch was super disgusting... Reminded me of what you would find at a garage sale.  However the red rooms are more modern, elegant, clean, oh and the beds are comfy.We had an awesome view of the tower and the bellagio fountains.  One of my main issues was the casino... We aren't gamblers but we wanted to just have some fun and throw away a little extra cash.  The dealers we had at the roulette tables were weirdos.. One guy chatted our ears off about going out to dinner with his wife and mom.  I know it's a ploy to distract us, but it was terrible and ruined the moment to loosen up and relax.   We do highly recommend Gordon Ramsay Steak which is located in the hotel!
Never stay in the end room, the whole room smell likes public restroom! I changed room three times. The staff is not that professional, need more training!
Pros: . -Mini fridge was empty, allowing us to store our leftovers. . -Bed was comfortable. -Online check in and checkout offered. -Friendly dealers. . Cons:. -No bathroom fan. -View outside our window was of the top of another building, nothing special. (We had a 2 queen red luxury room). -Resort fee is really high considering I used none of the services it includes. . Stayed here 2 nights with a buddy. I had stayed at Caesars all prior times in Vegas. This is not Caesars. It's a decent hotel though. No major complaints. I won some money here at the tables playing blackjack.
The Paris is a great hotel! It is centrally located and has a great view of the Bellagio fountain! There are lots of good food options and everything is very clean and well maintained! The staff are great too!
it was all right i think the rooms need updating but the service was good =)
We paid for a pet friendly room, which was a$150 pet fee. It ended up being just a normal room. Once we told them they said they would bring the amenities right up. They did and handed us a garbage bag with a rolled up mat,two dog treats the size of a dime and a two bowls. Besides that the wall paper was coming off the walls and the beds are very hard. Not a fan. The only thing we liked was it was right on the strip. Next time I'll stay at the rio. Much better pet rate and the rooms are amazing!
This is for the Guatavo's bar in the casino.... . First of all, I don't come to Vegas often and I'm with my wife for her birthday and my 5 yr old daughter.. . Coming 30mins early for a reservation for Mon Ami Gabi, they could not accommodate an early arrival. Understandable as it was very busy.  We were given a pager and was told I can walk around but to stay within the hotel grounds and nearby so the pager can receive a signal.. . Walking out, my daughter said she was very thirsty wanting water. Closest access was Gustavo's bar.  Feeling we should order a drink other than just asking for water for my daughter, I see an Asian bartender not busy and just eye balling us as my daughter climbed up to my arms still saying she wanted some water and asking my wife if she wanted anything. As I approached with my daughter in my arms, he says I can't serve you with your daughter in your arms and being by the bar. Ok, I put her down and told her to go to my wife several feet away from the bar. Now he says, I can't serve you with or without your daughter nearby.  I paused and thought to myself WTF?!! Ok, I get it... Casino bar, under 21, hotel/casino policy and perhaps state law but why don't you ask/wait what I wanted to drink first as it may be non alcoholic bev or be more clear in a more polite manner originally instead of giving me a stinkeye as I approached and for a 2nd time with another comment?!! I just wanted to get my daughter some water and thought I should at least buy a drink to get one or is the only thing you serve is alcohol based? Or if she fainted then you may reconsider?. . Yes, I could've seeked a water fountain but don't know how far it would be or how far the pager would receive signal, and I was willing to spend $3-7+ for a drink and a cup of water to get to her right away.. . If you only made clear initially that "I can't serve you because you have an underage child and is based on state/city law, etc...or a distance that's acceptable to be served and if whether that included non alcohol beverages".  I would respect that being educated on this and comply, but giving an attitude is not acceptable as you are in the service industry and you don't know who you're servicing. With friends in upper management in the hospitality business and even with Harrah's group, I'm  not going to go there regarding this and I don't want to be pity.. . But this unprofessional bartender needs an attitude adjustment and be more service oriented.
