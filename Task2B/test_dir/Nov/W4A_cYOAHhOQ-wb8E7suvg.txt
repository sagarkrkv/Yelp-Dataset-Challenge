I was dragged to this show by my girlfriend, but I must say that I really enjoyed the show.  I would recommend this show to anyone.
Absolutely stunning!! I've seen some cirque shows before but this was unlike any other. It actually had s story and was truly breathe taking watch. This is my new favorite vegas show!
Ok... I was so excited to see this show. EVERYONE I know or met who has seen it absolutely RAVED about it. Did we see a different show???? I thought it was mediocre at best. Maybe I'm a snob from seeing too many great shows... I was bored. And yet overstimulated... How is that possible???. Pros:. 1) there is a storyline (although transparent and one-dimensional). 2) there are extremely gifted performers in this show. 3) the technology is impressive (although over-utilized and often has the opposite effect and takes away from the artfulness of the show).. 4) impressive costume and set imagery. . CONS:. 1) the 80s/90s hair band, heavy metal, electric guitar, screeching, ear-bleeding, nails on a chalkboard music! From start to finish was this horrible, distracting soundtrack!! Ugh. It was deafening and tasteless.. 2) the storyline. Oh. My. God. Thank you for having a story but writers: could you give people the benefit of the doubt and allow just a little bit of subtlety and room for interpretation??? Seriously the first words on the soundtrack are "Should I love him or should I not?" Come on... This just makes me feel like you don't trust the audience to have enough sense to translate the performance into the message OR you don't have the confidence in the performance to accurately convey the message. Either way, it's pretty simple to figure out without the need to be so obvious- this is not a complex story. It just makes me roll my eyes. The girl is weighing the pros and cons of giving in to a lover. Yup. Got it.. 3) The only mystery in this performance is why in the world is the name in French? I would like to know. Because literally nothing from the show is even distantly related to something French. The entire soundtrack is American metal music and English subtitling. The cirque aspects of the show are so far removed from traditional French origination. So I just don't understand. Maybe it's just me. It's a love story and that's decidedly Parisian? I just don't know. . 4) So. Much. Technology. I feel like there is a complete lack of purity in this show. The performers can't showcase their talent because of all the set, lighting, sound distractions. It's just too much. . . I wanted to love this show but I just didn't. It was fine. It was an experience. And apparently I am the minority when it comes to my opinion of this show. So there is a good chance someone else would love it. But I've seen other shows that were magical, subtle, lovely, smart, deep... And this show was not any of those things. :/
Big brilliant memorable Las Vegas show without a bad seat in the house! Truly all equal in this theater.
One of the best shows that I've seen. I enjoyed the theater stage, music and perfomance of all. I loved the acrobatic on water, its unique. . They allow to take picture, which is nice. Just remember to turn off the flash.. . I would go again! I really love this show.
So. Incredibly. Awesome. I watched the whole show with clasped hands against my face in awe. It had wondrous feats, displays of incredible strength, eye popping costumes and props, a bit of humor, magic and changing sets that make you wonder how they pulled it off. There's nothing that would have made this show any better. I had reservations because it was not a cirque du soleil show. It was better. No strange transitions and numbers that left you scratching your head. I would most definitely recommend to anyone wanting a bang for their buck.
This was the first "Vegas" show my husband and I have gone to...loved it! It was amazing!
I've gotta preface my review with the fact that I've seen quite a few Cirque shows over the years, so I wasn't exactly blown away by Le Reve, but with that being said I was captivated the entire show.. . First off, the theater is beautiful and set up so any seat has a great view.  We sat in the last row on the side "VIPs" sit (though we weren't in those seats), so we had a good view of everything.  I loved the "vibe" when you walked in... very romantic with deep colors and a mist in the air - nice touch.  This Cirque show is unique and I loved the water.  It was mesmerizing watching the performers go in and out of the water so easily and of course they were all very talented.  Compared with other Cirque shows this story was quite easy to understand and the theme went well with water.  Honestly I am always amazed at the crazy things some of these talented individuals can do, simply amazing.. . I highly recommend Le Reve.  We got tickets as part of a package with the Wynn, but if I was in the market for seeing a Cirque de Soleil show I would definably pay to see this Le Reve.
I've seen two Cirque shows this year - O (commonly compared to Le Reve) and Mystere, both directed by the same director as Le Reve, Franco Dragone, and I'd say this is equally good but different.. . O and Mystere are both more cohesive in terms of theme, costumes, and atmosphere. The costumes and magic tricks (complete with doves) feel kind of retro or like elements lifted out of older Vegas shows, and the music and atmosphere seems to switch between edgy and Cirque du Soleil surreal. There's supposed to be a story but it's nearly impossible to follow, at least for me, and some of it seemed a bit absurd, like the devil and angel characters and the guy with the magic scepter. . . Cirque du Soleil shows also have a greater variety of and more impressive acrobatics - I felt that a lot of Le Reve was mostly the performers diving and flipping into the pool below at different heights.. . But what makes Le Reve unique and worth seeing is really the visuals created by the performers, props, and effects. I came to see it because of the pictures and videos I've seen online that I felt I had to experience in person - the tiered stage, the tree, etc. The design of the theater makes the whole experience feel very arresting and immersive and certain parts of the show definitely have a dreamlike quality.. . Overall, I recommend it. But better than Cirque shows like O and Mystere? Not really. Just good in its own way.
Quite amazing..prepare to be shocked and awed. ... The show is amazing. .completely amazing.... . Two stars. .the entry process and drinks..sucks..feels like a 3rd world country. .. . Slow. .very slow..real slow..takes away any feeling of anticipation. ... The lobby is ooor..built and decorated as an old movie theater. The lines are long. Very very long... The time to get drinks is so freaking stupid.... The staff is nice..but poorly managed.... The process is rediculous. ..... . Sooo.. see the show and tolerate the process... . P.s. if you kioe shoes. .women shoes. .do not look up..amazing shoe show with all the vegas visitors
My boyfriend surprised me with tickets to this show for our anniversary. We've already seen all the Cirque shows so we needed something new. . . In all honestly, I think this might be one of my favorite shows I've ever seen. I think it's better than the comparable Cirque de Soleil "O".  The placement and stage usage really is incredible. We were seated in section F three rows back and I feel like we had the best view in the house---you could see everything up close as well as all of the aerial acts. . . My parents are coming to visit for Christmas and want to see O but their Christmas gift might just be two tickets to Le Reve instead. . . Great show and definitely worth the $!
Le Reve deserves more than 5 stars. This show is breathtaking. Everything about it was perfect: the stage, performers, costumes, music, decor, acrobats.... My friend recommended this show and it definitely met our expectations and more. I highly recommend this show. It was pricey, but it was worth every penny we spent.
Visually stunning, amazing and talented performers. Don't think there's a bad seat in the house.
Loved this show! This review is a bit late (we saw it about 6 months ago) but I was inspired to write one since we are looking to buy tickets for my parents-in-law to see it when they go to Vegas.. . I was completely captivated from start to finish - the dancing, water acts and air acts were all incredible, along with the set and features. I also really like that it is a round stage and a smaller audience - there isn't a single bad seat! (Unless you're up front and don't want to get wet).. . We also saw O a couple months after Le Reve, and I must say, I was a bit underwhelmed by O. Le Reve seemed to have a lot more action, many more impressive moves and had a storyline to follow - O seemed to be a lot more disjointed and I just wasn't as impressed by the acts. Le Reve was much more dramatic.. . Although I liked that Le Reve had a storyline, I wasn't overly taken in by the actual 'plot'. It didn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but I liked that it followed a storyline.. . I would absolutely recommend Le Reve to anyone, particularly over O.
It is the second time I've had the pleasure to see  this show and they updated and improved the act. Beautiful choreography with the fountain lights coinciding with a tune, it is a show mixed with the fountains similar to Bellagio . I enjoyed the story, comedy and magic!
