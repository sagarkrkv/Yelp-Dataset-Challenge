Fantastic breakfast, great service (thank you, Lisa). I had the strawberry cream French toast.
I love Egg and I and Egg Works. Great food, plenty of choices, nice presentation, moderately priced. Very friendly servers and nice ambience. Great tasting Traditional Benny! Would be a 5 star if not for a long wait.
In a city full of great breakfast places, the Egg & I is definitely one of them. Seriously, though, it's very good. And relatively cheap. Very unpretentious. And the banana nut muffins are amazing. Our server, Amanda, was the best! Very friendly and attentive and never once rushed us even though we took our sweet time. . . If you can make it off the strip, this place is definitely worth it.
Just finished breakfast Amanda are service was fantastic!   We sat outside enjoyed the nice weather and savored out banana nut muffin!!
Great breakfast spot away from the strip and fantastic prices! Best vegas breakfast imo
This was probably the best spot we hit on a recent trip to vegas.  It's always a good sign when a place is packed midweek. . We were sat immediately and there was no wait to receive drinks and menus. . Our waitress was Chance and quite honestly one of the best servers I've had in a long time. She knew her menu and was open to giving suggestions. She was also VERY attentive and upbeat in general. during a pretty good breakfast rush, mind you!. Firstly, as I said before, it's busy. But you never have to flag down a waitress or ask when your order is coming. There's a little sign on the table which lets you flip between a happy egg and a frowny egg. If the frowny egg is showing, the waitress/waiter is supposed to help you right away. I never had to use this sign because the service was so prompt. . First thing I loved was the bottomless cup of coffee. You're given a full thermos pitcher of coffee all for your table and there's plenty of sugar (or substitutes) and cream at hand. . I usually ask for a recommendation on what to order when traveling and Chance was eager to help. She told me about the Chile Relleno Benedict and said that it's not normally on the menu (special days only) but that it really was a must try. Honestly, I'm not huge on chile relleno but hey she seemed enthusiastic and I went ahead and ordered it. . It was amazing. And it SHOULD be an everyday menu item. I'll go into both dishes and what was so awesome about them below. . Chile Relleno Benedict:. Wow. The dish was amazing. Benedicts make just about anything better but this was no joke. REALLY well thought out and balanced. First thing I noticed was that the eggs were PERFECTLY poached. The whites were soft but not slimey or runny. There was zero cooked yoke. It was warm and ran smooth just the way god intended. . I don't know what was breaded in the dish but it was either the Chile itself or the thinly sliced (and tender as all hell) chicken breast. The breading was really what made the dish I think. It added just enough saltiness that I didn't need to add salt or pepper to my breakfast. I always add salt and pepper (unless I get chicken fried steak) and that was a pleasant surprise. The chile and the chicken were topped off with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. There were home fries on the side which also needed no seasoning beside what was already there but honestly I would have been ok just eating the chile relleno benedict. It was really that good. . My GF ordered the veggie pesto sandwich with Cajun fries. I didn't try the sandwich itself but she said the bread was very tender and the pesto was really tasty. I DID sneak a few fries however and loved them. Thinly cut shoestring style potatoes covered in seasoning. Another instance where salt was not necessary. Really they would have been fine without ketchup. . I fully intend on visiting this place every time I head to Las Vegas and can't say enough good things about it. Thank you Chance for the awesome recommendation and thank you Egg & I for turning out exceptional food and service at a great price!
Super great service. The second we walked in we were seated Imeadiatly outside, there was full house but the wait wast not long at all. . Chance was our server and she greeted us so warmly.. Chance is the reason I will be coming back!!
This is a great breakfast place with so many delicious choices. But the best thing about this place is the incredible customer service you get from Amanda. She is the most cheerful, friendly and super nice waitress we have had the pleasure to meet.
We ordered some kind of Mexican dish that comes with tortillas, and asked waitress for the corn tortillas,  because I'm gluten free, and we got flour tortilla inside, we asked again and second time they brought us flour tortilla, after we spoke with manager she proposed us to get extra muffin. Seems like she doesn't know what gluten free means
Short and simple good portions and amazing food definitely recommend it Chance was our server and she was exceptional!
Egg and I, WHY ARE YOU NOT IN CALIFORNIA?. . Stopped by here when I was hungry and visiting Vegas. I ordered the stuffed french toast, and let me tell you, it did not dissappoint. Absolutely delicious. Was expecting hashbrowns as potatoes, nope. This place goes above and beyond and gives you some of the most delicious breakfast potatoes you will ever eat. Our server was extremely sweet. Wish I had gotten her name, she reccomended dishes to us and was super helpful. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas.
I had a Sunday morning breakfast at the egg and I yesterday.  The place was super busy, and the hostess wrote my name down as milassa (it's Melissa) and when I told her it Was spelled Melissa,  she said "we'll figure it out" thankfully,  our server,  Kelcey was awesome!!!   She made sure to do her quality check, even though she had several other tables to take care of,  and when I had an avacado issue,  she took care of it and the manager stopped by the table to make sure everything was okay.  The only thing that I was displeased about was that this one location does not serve bloody Mary's (the other 5 do) or any alcohol in general.  I was seriously looking forward to a bloody with my eggs benny.
Yummy! Had breakfast here this morning. It's very busy on a Sunday morning. There was a wait but if you're willing to sit at the fist available seating then you get right in by sitting on the patio. . . With 60 degree temps in November the patio feels about 50 degrees in the shade but there are heaters by each table to warm you up. It wouldn't be so bad if the wind wasn't blowing so much this morning making it feel more chilly. Plus I noticed the food gets cold quicker while outside.. . My husband and I ordered The Classic with a side of turkey bacon and sausage for the meat. It's was quick, fresh and delicious. This place really is one of the best local breakfast spots in town IMHO. It's not as greasy as the rest.
Wish this place was in California! Gotta get the banana nut muffin. I've only had the country fried steak here, but refuse to get anything else. The potatoes are so bomb here, Airways finish it! Service is great and is always crowded. The 4.5 stars on Yelp are definitely deserved!
Amazing!!!!! Great service, delicious food. If you are in the area you must try this place out. Skillets, omelette are very good. Fresh baked muffins are delish. We found this place last year and heading out to Vegas this weekend, for sure we will be stoping by.
This is my favorite breakfast place to go to when I'm in Vegas. I usually save this for my last stop before going home. Always making Vegas a yummy food destination. . . If you're a breakfast person this is the place for you. They have every kind of breakfast you can think of and they do it right. . . Also, a must is there banana nut muffin that you can also buy to take home as gift! Always really really yummy! This place never disappoint.
The food is good and they have a good variety. but the only problem is that the service is a little slow. and I got a pastrami Reuben  which also came with fries and a deli pickle and they have a good selection of coffee creamers.
I was in carb heaven at the Egg and I, had the biscuits and gravy and the banana walnut muffin which were both very good. Servicewas very good and our food was delivered quite fast. Crowded, but the wait went very fast. Look like a new favorite in Vegas for me.
Our server Alexa definitely deserves a trip to Disneyland! The food was amazing as always! It usually is a bit of a wait but that's because everything is so good!
Good food. Great service. Our server Chance was the best. The banana bread is a must. Also the chicken fried steak
Everything is good here.. Go here everytime im at vegas because it's cheap and delicious.. . I've had the avocado sour cream omelette and the country fried steak skillet.. Both are amazing. . . service is good as well
The husband and I were in town for the weekend looking for a good spot to have breakfast at. Good thing I looked up on yelp first because it was so good!! I had the chile relleno omelette with the works potatoes on the side and it was very good. The husband had the works omelette and it was tasty as well. If your in town try this place out. We will definitely be coming again when we are back in the area visiting. It was packed but all worth the wait!!
We've been to LV many times and we usually eat breakfast buffet near the strip. But this place is good. Lizete reserved our seats because we called in. Once seated Debra just made us feel special with her service. The muffin is sooooo fresh and tasty. She even accommodated our request to replace the ordered toast with the muffin. I highly recommend for visitors to have your breakfast at Egg and I.
Great food, large servings and if your lucky, Dariesia will serve you.... If your lucky.. . :). . A return trip is required.
Fast, friendly, and fresh... All 3 qualities I like in my food establishments. There's a lot of items in the menu for breakfast, lunch, & dinner.
