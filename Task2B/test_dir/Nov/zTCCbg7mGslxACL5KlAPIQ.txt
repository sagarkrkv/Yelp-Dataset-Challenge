Delicious! Get the fettuccine alfredo! Fantastic spot to eat after a night of partying.
The first time we tried this place when it first opened, they had more exotic choices such as rabbit. duck etc that very few buffets offer. Maybe because it was also a weekend at that time. Recently my husband and I tried it again since we had a 2 for 1 offer (from myvegas slot games promotion) we also have tried it on a weekday and it wasn't the best I had. The selections/varieties are much smaller than much other buffets for the same price). . . Generally, the flavors are not bad and of the selections they have they still yummy but for the price you pay, I have had better and again with more selections as well. I would come again only with the 2 for 1 promotion. Otherwise, there are much better buffet options at other hotels.
I hate this stupid buffet. I end up here when I stay at Aria for one reason, pure laziness. I usually eat here right after checking and I am "already here" or right before I check out, and I figure it's quick and better than fast food on the road. Each time I have eaten here (at least three times now) it has been for the weekend brunch. I have disliked it each time.. . They never have fresh mimosas. I never know where they come from, but no bottles of champagne in sight.. . The food has been cold, and left around between the morning rush and the lunch rush, so keep that in mind if you come at an odd time. Hopefully, you don't come here at all.
My favorite buffet in Vegas. THIS WAS AMAZINGLY AWESOME! Quality & wide selection. Everything from grape leave wraps to miso soup to crawfish to pizza to fresh sliced prime rib & pork to eggs Benedict to hand made sorbet... Upscale and way better than Bacchanal that is advertised everywhere! I will be visiting this buffet each time I go to Vegas.
very nice seafood buffet! !!
Always my go to buffet while staying on the strip. I've been here four time and have never been disappointed. Food is always delicious and fresh. I normally go with a 2 for 1 and purchase additional bottomless beverages for $12.99 each. A steal for two hours of food and beverages!
Best buffet in this area, plain and simple. The coffee is great. They bring you a glass of good OJ as soon as you sit.  I suggest the scrambled eggs, chorizo, 2 types of breakfast sausage, corned beef and hash is excellent!  Bacon, sausage gravy, ham, omelettes, EGGS BENEDICT, shrimp, cookies, muffins, and lastly, home fries!  Coming from NJ, the "Land of 1,000 Diners", you won't be disappointed at this buffet! Very spacious, Nice scenery and courteous, fast staff, this place is worth going too.....  In fact, I'm going back tomorrow morning!
Just came back from a week in Vegas and I'm a little buffeted out but here goes. I remembered going to this buffet when they first opened a handful of years ago - I thought it was fantastic and worth the $50 we paid on an Easter Sunday. However, they have apparently renovated and this buffet is like half the size, with less choices and not as fancy. My wife and I had a 2-for-1 coupon so it was worth it - but I wouldn't pay full price. As far as items: Italian section was poor, it was spaghetti and meatballs and chicken marsala and antipasta. Carving board was quite good with four different types of meat - mostly beef. sushi was eh. Mussels were great, escpecially new zealand mussels. Most everything was average. Deserts were OK. Waitress service was very good, always filled our drink. I would probably give 3 1/2 stars but cant. At 2-for-1 I like this place but not at full price.
This place is AWESOME! The 2-for-1 lunch is pretty enough to get enough points for on the MyVegas app, and if you get there at like 3:20 you can pay for one lunch, get two, and at 3:30 they start serving dinner entrees.. . I dig the crab, sushi, prime rib, tandoori chicken, and dessert bar but the BEST thing is the cedar plank smoked salmon. So good!
Best Buffet in Vegas!  Lunch - hot crab legs, pork belly, beef, sausage selection, steamed clams and mussels, dim sum, smoked salmon and trout, and all the usual.  I really don't understand the negative reviews, the food is good quality and tasty.  The lunch is $24 so not as cheap as Excalibur but a hell of a lot better.  They also have a bottomless alcoholic beverage deal for $13 which includes good beer, wine, sangria, mimosas, and bellinis.
Not a bad buffet at all, just not a great one either. Being the skinflint that I am I came for the lunch at 3:30 so that it would bleed over into the dinner service. Worked like a charm!. . Carving station was alright. Not as good as The Wicked Spoon, but the effort was there. Dessert area was OK, but I wasn't impressed with their overall selection. I love red velvet cupcakes but they didn't have any. Just red velvet macaroons. Salad bar was blah. But let's face it you don't win friends with salad.. . The dim sum selections were OK for the most part. Clearly not as good as a dedicated Asian restaurant but not awful like a $10 Asian buffet either. . . So overall I sum this place up as being OK at everything. Nothing sucked really bad but nothing was amazingly awesome either.
Food was great.  Had pork belly that was flavorful and fatty.  Good selection of carved meats, beef, sausages, turkey.  Warm Dungeness crab legs, most place only have cold if any at all, they were tasty and fresh tasting and scored to make it easy to eat.  There were cold King Crab that I didn't try.  There was Indian Food with Naan.  Good curry flavor in the food.  Also had pasta station, Italian food, dim sum, sushi.  Not as many stations as some places but quality is better.  Had the Carmel butterscotch pudding and a scoop of vanilla gelato.  Very good.. Price is high but if you go to the chain restaurant across the street get an appetizer, entree, dessert with a soda it will cost you over $40.. So splurge and enjoy yourself.
We REALLY liked this buffet. My husband doesn't usually eat from the buffet, but this one he took a chance on and LOVED it. They have everything from fresh crab legs to sushi. Fresh food is brought out regularly and the carved meat is to die for!. I didn't give it 5 stars just because of the price. We had lunch which was the same price as dinner. However we were told that during dinner they bring out prime rib and better desserts.
The food is great here . At a reasonable price, I just think they need to step up their service.  Not the first time here and came back to same experience
We went here for brunch on a Sunday and were pleased with their options and cleanliness. Some of our favorites included the red velvet stuffed pancakes, the steamed crab legs with hot butter, the eggs Benedict station, the chocolate chip with walnut cookies (kind of tastes like the Double Tree cookies.. Mmm so good), and the gelato. . . They do not have an overwhelming amount of options, and the presentation is okay. Personally I think other buffets like the Wicked Spoon at Cosmo has cuter presentation for some of their dishes, and they might have a few more options. However, still not a bad deal. Prices are average for a "nice" vegas buffet. $24.95 for breakfast Monday-Friday. No breakfast buffet options on the weekends, just brunch for $29.95. Not sure how much lunch or dinner runs; I've been here twice and both times were weekend brunches. Much better than the overpriced Bacchanal buffet at Cesar's, not as overpriced as Wynn (but also less options), and not as cute as Wicked Spoon. But as long as there are steamed crab legs with hot butter, I'm there
It was OK. Not what I want to see in a Vegas buffet in a five star resort. It should be great! not ok. . I've dated people like this....looks great on the outside, but then when you try to have a bit of true discussion...it's just a big blah. Nothing really there. . The food looks great, but has no real taste. . I had a $75 food credit at the Aria, so my wife and I used it for this. Not worth it. . If I paid real money, would have given it 1 star. . Oh! Also two plates I picked up in the clean dishes pile had food residue on them. Yech. Had to get an extra napkin because I put my hand in something squishy and yellow under my plate. Ok, yeah, this review is one star now.  Choose somewhere else to go.
I came here for the first time last summer and was truly disappointed. It's because it's overpriced even with myVegas reward. There is really nothing worth to eat there except the prime rib, which is in any standard buffets. There is an extra $10 if you want unlimited drink, which is a minus. In other buffets on the trip such as the Mirage, you pay $30 with unlimited drinks. But with the Aria buffet, you have to pay around $40 without drinks. Plus, you would have to wait a long time for the servers to come refilling your drinks. You also have to pay extra tips for those servers. In the Mirage buffet, you can avoid this uncomfortable and inconvenient thing. Overall, it's not worth the money.
After a 1 hour wait in the VIP line ( we kind of asked for it by going on Thanksgiving Day ),we were greeted by our server who took our drink order, delivered them then was never to be seen again. . I expected so much more for such a nice, new hotel. The offering was large, but not well maintained.  . Each time I visited the dim sum area the steamers were near empty and what was inside did not look appetizing.   The sushi was hard from being out too long, again an issue with replenishment. . The salad bar was fresh and offered a great variety. Although I didn't indulge on the baked potato bar, it looked good. . The Carvery left a bit to be desired. The prime rib lacked flavor and was too rare for most.  Again I was scraping what was left in the pan on any of the hot items. . The dessert bar offered some really delicious treats. . I'm willing to cut them some slack due to the Holiday and the size of the crowd.  Hence the 3 stars....
$50 a person for this?? Plus 18% gratuity for parties over 8. We saw our "server" twice. We had to chase people down to get our drinks. The food was mediocre at best, I've had better microwave tv dinners.The only thing I enjoyed was the coffee at the end. . . If you're looking for a disappointing meal, try McDonald's instead; at least you're only paying $6 for a bad meal instead of $50.
The One Where Sandy Was Warned to Not Eat Here.. . And we still did.  Le Sigh.  . . Our first night in Vegas, we decided to have a group dinner here.  My local friends all warned me against it saying that "only virgin Vegas goers would eat here."  However, since I wasn't calling the shots, I went with my friends to have dinner with bottomless drinks (for an additional $15, which I didn't get, but my friends did).  . . Anyway, just don't come here and waste your money.  The food was horrible.  I sampled basically everything and the only thing I liked was their gelato (I mean, if they messed that up...).  I'm not the type of person who would eat her money's worth since I'm allabout quality of food.  The quality was nonexistence.  I just can't stress enough about how poorly their food was and we were here at a normal dinner hour.  The fact that the place was not happening said a lot.
Aria is a beautiful hotel I admit but the buffet was so subpar! And the service was atrocious. I'm a local and mom likes to play the slots so somehow we ended up here. . . The food looks amazing but as soon as you put it in your mouth you wonder if it was just a display. Bland tasteless and the meat was sometimes chewy. The lamb actually smelled! . . Our waiter Sonny gave us evil eye all night and looked annoyed when we ordered even a tea.. . Never again .. But the creme brulee was nice lol
I think I went to this buffet like three times in a span of a week while my parents visited, all during lunch because you really can't beat their prices while on the strip for a decent buffet. . . We came here specifically for the seafood, it's probably a hit or miss with it though. There are times when I found the crab meat to be super salty, not sure why but then the next day it was just fine so I don't know who it is that's adding the salt, but stop it! . . The rest of the food is alright, nothing too spectacular to note. They have a decent selection of dessert but I'll probably only stick to the gelato as the rest of it isn't THAT great at least to me. . . So really if you love seafood and don't want to venture down to the M for their weekend seafood buffet, then the one here is just as good! Might cost a bit more, but it's all the time so can't really complain and considering it's on the strip too? I think it came out to $27 per person with tax and maybe tip? I forgot if that was including tip or not but definitely tax. So really it's not a bad price at all. . . The service is pretty consistent, it's not bad but if they're slammed it's going to take a bit for you to get their attention. I, for one, drink a lot of water when I'm eating so I usually ask for two or three glasses so I know I'll have something before they get back to our table when it's busy. . . I like it overall and will be coming back with family for seafood again.
