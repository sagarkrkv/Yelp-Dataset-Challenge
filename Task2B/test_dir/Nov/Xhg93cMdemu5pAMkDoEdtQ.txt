Great service, amazing atmosphere, even better food. It was very busy in there but the wait was not long at all. They also give Total Rewards members a discount, which is a plus! I will definitely be back.
Food=not the best. Service=horrible! . . Only known for the frozen hot chocolate. Everything else you can pass on.
Music played was way too loud in an enclosed area, wasn't willing to swap us out to another table just caused we ordered our food. Piss poor service
I was excited to come here because I had been to the other 2 locations. But was little disappointed. This was my first time actually ordering a meal at Serendipity. I had brunch and ordered the corned beef hash. It was flavorful, but I seemed like it had been sitting out a while before it got to me. The food was a little dry and my eggs tasted like rubber. Not good. And the service was a little slow. Granted it was a busy day, but our server hardly came over to check on is to see if we needed anything. Another downside was my aunt wanted to order a hot dog but the waiter said that he would have to check since it was brunch hours. He never came back to let us know we couldn't order it. For dessert I ordered the mine frozen hot chocolate. I had been wanting to try that one. Unfortunately I can't say it was my favorite. I will probable stick to regular of peanut butter next time. Still love to frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity, but I had better experiences at the ones in NYC and Miami.
$18 for the quality and flavor of a Grand Slam. Average breakfast plate price is $22. One of those places that looks busy and worthy because of the central location. Service was absolutely pathetic on a slow day. One of our friend's got his food wrong, the server made her way over 10 minutes later just to say, "I put it in right! It wasn't my fault!" How professional. Took 15 minutes to get greeted, 25 to put food in, and after meal, 20 minutes with dirty plates in front of us waiting for the check. The server grabbed our cards and continued to run food and greet other tables, taking another 15 minutes to return with our check. I am a server who was with a cook and a bartender. I can fairly say do not waste your money. Wait twice as long for a bang out breakfast at Hash House A Go Go.
Nice for breakfast
The food was so-so, but the cotton candy martini was great.
I tried the Ahi salad which was just very good, the avocado was just over whelming though, it was just too much, but other than that it was really good. The burger was very juicy, delicious, and cooked to perfection.. Our dessert was Snickers sunday, which has amazing crunchy yet chewy melting caramel snickers, lovely peanut butter sauce, chocolate sauce, and tons of whipped cream. It was just an amazing sunday. so big, between two of us it was impossible to finish. I am definitely coming back soon to try out more desserts. Everything was just so amazing, the menu looked awesome, so hard to choose one single thing.. Quick service, there is a bit of a wait, which is fine, since it is totally worth it.
Service was good.  Food for me was average.  If your putting chicken and waffles on the menu it needs to be good!   Other people I was with liked their food. So I would give it a try.  Like. Most restaurants in Vegas, a bit pricy but the portions here are large if that is something you care about.
Really nice location and beautiful patio. Crab cake benedict is great as well is the frozen hot chocolate but the service leaves much to be desired. Granted there was a computer issue, it seems like nothing was timely.
13$ for a grande size cup of ice cold peanut butter hot fudge chocolate? Not worth it, it tasted like any other blended drink. Not a great experience and not worth my money.
This is our 3rd time here and the prev 2times were good experiences with awesome overpriced desserts-but hey it's Vegas.  We called ahead for a table for about 20 as we were celebrating my sons birthday with his baseball team.  Service was painfully slow at 1100pm, we were reminded constantly about their closing time of 1200 and the food was cold!!!!  Not how to celebrate my sons 15th birthday at all---all the boys just wanted to leave without ordering the Treasure Chest.  We were approached by the manager Shawn, who could not have been more rude--he questioned why we cancelled the treasure chest ice dessert as they were making it---first off never ordered it just asked questions about it, told him the service was very slow with cold food and our boys were falling asleep.   He looked like he wanted to say more to us as he was very upset but then he walked away. Then we finally hot the bill!!!!!!!!! So overpriced for horrible tasting food!!!! Even drinks were $5 each.  We started to settled up the bill and my friend took out her Rewards card and it was denied!!!! Really--we were told the bill was already complete and they would add the points but not take off the 10%!!! By then it was after midnight and thus manager just wanted us out---wrong move Shawn!!!!  My friend and I  got our 10% off and he cont to have smart ass comments for us.. I told him thanks for ruining m sons Birthday and he said --" like I ruined it,". I will be contacting the general manager and corporate.. Funny as we went for dessert on Friday night around 1000ish, had great service and dessert which is why my son wanted to come back with his team!!!
Food was just okay for the amount of money you'll spend. The menu is purposefully written to trick you into spending more money. . . Bill was one hundred dollars for some pancakes. . . . Dont recommend.
I've come almost full circle in a way.  I went to the NYC Serendipity 4 & 1/2 years ago and experienced a very disappointing food experience which led me to start my very first Yelp review.. . I've walked by this Vegas location many times.  It's located street corner at Caesar's hotel and casino.  This time we stopped with our friends and went inside the restaurant. I wanted them to try the famous frozen hot chocolate.. . Hubby and I shared the 8oz serving.  They also offer the 16oz serving as in NYC.   And we got the nachos appetizer for the four of us to share.. . And it's a good thing too.   The nachos were enough for four and more.. . The only disappointment this time was sharing the 8oz frozen hot chocolate with hubby.  I took small sips while he took huge slurps.  When I looked up, he almost finished the whole thing.  Needless to say I thought about the frozen hot chocolate and complained the rest of the day.  Too bad I can't Yelp about hubby's slurping.. . I said we shoulda gotten the 16oz instead.  Next time.. . Service was good.  Our order came promptly.
The food was amazing!! HUGE portions and all around good.  We fed six people for about 150.00 in Vegas this is actually a pretty good price.    The reason I didn't give five stars was because of the customer service.  I asked the waitress to bring my daughter a frozen hot chocolate with a candle in it for her birthday (i saw that someone else had this done so that's why I knew it was possible).   She came to the table with my husbands banana split with a candle in it.... I asked her where the frozen hot chocolate was and she said, "oh well we'll just use this"  o.o   I purposely went and secretly asked them to do this for her and then the waitress pretty much ruined it.  Other than that it was really great place to eat. Overlooking the strip while we ate was cool.
Visit the Total Rewards Center in Caesars Palace to receive a coupon for a free 'Frrrozen Hot Chocolate' here with a purchase of $10 or more (found this via foursquare)- it's delicious! . . If I could I'd give this place 3 1/2 stars.  It is overpriced, but you get HUGE portions- plan accordingly.
We have dined here several times over the years. We went there the last time for my wife's birthday and it was the first time that we were there in a year or so. . . Before the food has pretty much always been on point while the service lacked for whatever reason. But this time the service was 100 times better and the food was as good as we remembered. Our server as friendly, on point and made sure that we had everything that we needed and then some.. . Food. . Mini Taco's - 3 Stars - Flavorful but a very small portion for the price.. Foot Long Hot Dog - 5 Stars - Always a winner. Can satisfy anyone's appetite.. Mac N Cheese - 5 Stars - Nice and Creamy and better with the Pancetta. Can satisfy anyone's appetite.. . Hopefully they can keep up the good work. If so we will be back more and more.
The desserts are pricey, and I guess the frozen hot chocolate was kind of watery, but it was so so so good!  I had the peanut butter one and would get the same thing again.  Our waiter was great.  My husband ordered the almond amaretto frozen hot chocolate, and we were both surprised it had no chocolate in it when it arrived.  It was still good though!
I was apprehensive to try after mixed reviews but was glad I did. Only a 15 minute wait on busy Saturday night.  Waitress was efficient and helpful. We learned that the smaller "cowards" portion for a Banana Split still had 3 scoops, the regular size 6 scoops. The Nacho appetizer was enough for 4 people. Had the foot long hotdog and BLT, both fantastic.  Food came out quickly.  Very satisfied and will definitely return.
I've dined here twice now and came to the conclusion that the Frozen Hot Chocolate is the only thing worth ordering. It tastes amazeballs! The food is served in huge portions but they don't taste extraordinary. If you have a Total Rewards card remember to bring it, there is a small discount on many of the food items.
This is the stuff of megassweetteethnirvana. The home of the Frozen Hot Chocolate, a sweet contradiction, it houses cake slices the size of one's head and sundaes so overflowing, it's served on a platter. I've been here many a time and have sampled almost all of the desserts. I'll save the thousands of dollars gold sundae for when I score the lottery. They are all saliva-inducing. I don't like chocolate cake. Give me a brownie, not not chocolate cake. This spot is the exception. Come here for a birthday, a date, a celebration - the desserts are worthy!
I ate here first in NY and loved the atmosphere and the food. The only downfall is that sometimes the wait can be ridiculous including service. One time I went with a friend and didn't eat until an hour later. The bartender was so gracious and comped our sangria for the wait. I have not eating everything but there is definitely some items worth the buck. My favorites are the sangria and frozen hot chocolate!
Quoted 20 minutes to get seated but were seated in 40. Fair enough, we were a part of six. We get seated and notice empty tables everywhere.. . Waited 15 minutes for water.. Then waited 20 minutes for coffee (which tasted funny).. Then waited 30 minutes for our deserts (why does ice cream with cookies on top take this long?). . Waitress used a whispering voice, and was unable to answer any of our questions. They brought out the wrong order, and finally she had a voice, and gave us the blame for the wrong order.. . I'd let this all go if this were an inexpensive desert spot, but for the price and terrible service I won't be returning.
Love love love this place! The portions are ridiculous and the service is wonderful. This is now a regular visit spot when we come to Vegas! Try the Las Vegas strip steak sandwich!!! Yummyyyy!!!
Came to Serendipity twice while on vacation in Vegas with my European honey and I can say it didn't live up to our expectations on our first visit so we went again hoping that we'd enjoy it more the second go around. Sadly, we didn't.. . On our first visit we got the White Chocolate Frozen Hot Chocolate to share which was good, but not worth the $11 price tag. Next we each got BBQ & Blue Burger which was flavorless and had insufficient BBQ sauce on it. This visit receives 2 stars.. . On our second visit (we were drunk) we got the All In Nachos and Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza. The nachos look delicious, but they taste so-so. I was really bummed that they just put melted cheese on the nachos instead of using nacho cheese (cheese whiz). Also, the chips underneath the top layer were pretty much missing all of the "All In" toppings so we were just eating plain chips. Thankfully, the Margherita Pizza was good so kicked the nachos to the side and feasted on the pizza. This visit receives 2 stars as well.. . If you want to try Serendipity I recommend coming after you've had a few drinks so you won't be pissed off about dropping $70+ dollars on a so so meal.
Came in on a Sunday afternoon for a late brunch without a reservation, and my party and I were debating whether or not we should take the 30-45 minute wait for a table, or just go to the walk-up counter for something quick. One hostess was on an iPad organizing the reservation list, and the other was greeting at the door. The one on the iPad was very nice and the other greeter was the rudest hostess I've ever seen. While we were quickly discussing our options, she continued to raise her voice and interrupt us in an effort to get our attention and see what we decided. She rolled her eyes at us, shook her head and sighed heavily and dramatically, as if we made her wait hours rather than thirty seconds.  There wasn't a line behind us, so I wasn't sure why she could act so impatient since she was just standing there with no other customers in sight. She looked me right in the eye as she behaved this way, appallingly unapologetic. I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and I've never given attitude to a guest. Especially when they're deciding whether or not to give you business! That alone made the decision easy, we walked away! Tip to management, educate your greeters on the importance of a FRIENDLY face :)
Super mediocre .  Words added to met min word counts. This limit is dumb.  I hope you have a great day. Skip this place
I LOVE this place!! This is my go to lunch spot. The food is always delicious and such HUGE portions! I have always been treated like gold by the staff and that means the world to me especially because I usually bring my kids (2 and 3)!! It is a great family friendly restaurant or if you just need to sober up from the night before! Please please please don't leave without trying the frozen hot chocolate!!!!!!! Ahhhh so delicious!!! The menu is a little pricey BUT the portions are so big it is totally worth it! I can't wait to go back again!
My pal needed...NEEDED as his last cheat meal a hot brownie sundae...they have a hot fudge brownie sundae on menu....waiter was kinda a pompous dude that was speaking down to me the whole night and it was driving me bonkers like I wanted to say dude im local and in the service industry like wtf is up...anyway he offered to HEAT my pals brownies up which was a nice touch!  HUGE PROTONS!  Nothing special but fun!  Perfect for a date if ur looking to do something booze free!!!
I like places with a lot of character and this is a nice fun place to visit. Is the food amazing? No, but it's not bad. Frozen hot chocolate really is like a chocolate shake but it's fun to drink and it is pretty good. I will definitely return for more desserts!
My girlfriend and I came here for lunch because she loved the movie.  I was a bit skeptical.  Boy was I wrong about this place.  . . We both ordered burgers, which were huge, and juicy.  I've had few burgers that were better.  The fries were super crispy and they provided us some really good ranch on the side.  There is a small bar in the corner but we did not drink anything.  However, I did order their coffee, which is French and it was phenomenal.. . Our server Valencia was top notch and was around at all times to service us and recommend great menu items to us.  The atmosphere is really "cute" as my girlfriend put it.  A lot of pink accenting, and vintage clocks, art. . . I will be coming back next time I'm in Vegas!
Its more hype than anything. My girls and I ordered the appetizer nachos, chicken strips and the mac and cheese and were utterly disappointed in taste. We had heard a lot about this place but not only did the food take long to arrive, the taste was very bland and basic. The waiter did not come around often and just to get seated took about 30 minutes. We did order the carrot cake sundae and that was about the only thing that made the visit there kinda good. I recommend only getting what they are known for, which is their desserts. Don't bother trying their food.
Had the burger and it was pretty good. The parmesan onion rings were really good. Loved the decor.. Super cute... Fast service... No complaints.
This is a neat, unique restaurant, but not one item was worth the price. This restaurant is not fine dining, so to pay six bucks for four onion rings seemed off to me.
Definatly so so food. Food is not particularly good at all. I went with a group and we ordered the cheeseburger, nachos, crab cakes, and mashed potatoes. Nothing was that great, just mediocre. The bun of the burger was burnt as well, which was upsetting because apparently the bread popular. Even if it wasn't burnt it still wouldn't have been that great. The cheeseburger cost 17 dollars, in my opinion it was worth 6. The restaurant went cheap on the fries and did not give me very much, which upset me. . .     The service was ok, definitely mediocre again but not awful. . .    To be fair this place is known for their desserts, I think. So I ordered an Oreo milkshake. The milkshake was fantastic. . .    The 3 stars comes because the milkshake was great. Everything else was not. Of I didn't enjoy the milkshake this definitely would not have even got 3 stars.
This spot is def for Dessert. The food is decent but the Sundaes & frozen hot chocolate is what's up here. Healthy portions all around, good stuff!
Terrible, terrible service for a nice place with nice desserts!!! One of the hostess actually literally kicked me out to wait standing instead of sitting somewhere else  for my take out order just because I bring my 6 yrs old nephew. FYI, we weren't even in the bar area and the place was quite empty. When I told her that the kid was tired and it was just for a few minutes left, she said "wutever" with an attitude. Terrible!
The positive: love the Oreo shake its thick, creamy and rich definitely will order it again when in town. The frozen chocolate kids devour it in nano seconds. They loved it. Kids love the burgers juicy and moist. Th crab cakes sandwiches not bad but I had better. . . The Negative: kids meal pasta with sausage not good at all. My three girls didn't touch it after a few bites. It had no flavor so bland and nothing that resembles pasta sauce at all yuk! The Caesar salad with steak, steak is bland and chewy, could use a little bit more Caesar dressing . . Overall I will go there again just for the Oreo shakes and maybe try their other desserts. I will skip their food its $$$$ not much flavor food just isn't good.
First time here. This is not a place id ever come back to. Half the rest was empty yet we still waited 20mins. Sat down and prob the most expensive items pushed by the servers cuz they want more tip. Asked them  is this gonna be too much for the two of us and he comments that it will be fine and the portions for one of the items is small. (Not really) meal in itself. W/E. . . What really bothered me was their service.. So the waiter has been gone for a bit and notice the three waitresses talking by their station. I try to flag one of them down for a condiment and refill. Nope they are too engaged with their convo so i wait. Mind u im sitting at the closest table. Finally 3 mins later they disperse and two of them are still chattering about their relationship or w/e and the older blonde waitress notices me and quickly comes over. Ask for a refill and gives me this attitude like shes talking down to me, and saids she will get the my waiter  to bring it out. Also ask for the condiment and cant really pass it off so grabs it from the station where she was chatting to my table 8ft away. . . IMO if everyone on yelp is complaining about the service. There is a reason. Go hire and train ur staff to be more professional, hire more for busy seasons instead of overworking ur current staff, balance out the female to male ratio, pay ur staff more so they put more effort and provide better service, hire one busboy will clean up and reduce service time, get rid of employees who come to work to socialize. . . sit there for 3 mins time 3 people is 9 mins of stuff something had to be done but got pushed back to be done later and provided slower service. Ive worked in an efficient sushi restaurant and so much stuff can be done in 9 mins.  Whoever the owner is go learn to mange the business better or u will keep getting one time business when you could be getting repeat customers. Im in vegas 4 to 5 times a year and i wont be ever returning after this first visit .
I came here to try the frozen hot chocolate since I wasn't able to make it to the Serendipity in NYC. The wait inside on a Saturday night was 15-20 minutes. We went outside and noticed they had a to go window. I ordered the frozen hot chocolate from there and it was delicious but not worth the $11. You would think the to go drinks would be cheaper since it's less and it comes in a plastic cup rather than the fancy and large bowl you get inside the restaurant.
