i ate hear on 10-26-14 around 6:00 pm.  even though i made reservations i still sat in the bar.  the restaurant decor was nice and i was the only one in the bar eating.. . the service at the bar was just okay.  they were not very helpful or overly nice.  i would give the service 4 stars.  i'm sure i would have received better service if i sat in the dining area.. . the food was good.  the bread basket was good.  my caesar salad was different but just okay.  my bone-in ribeye was a 4 star ribeye but the fries were great!!. . in my opinion i would go to delmonico steakhouse in the venetian which is a few steps away.  my dinner before tip was $101.
This place was amazing. While I only saw the bar part, and I use the term "saw" loosely here because it is very dark in the bar. So much so that the couple next to us was using their flash on their cellphone cameras to look at the wine list. . . The service here was what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber and price point. Very attentive, knowledgeable and professional. . . While the food here was amazing, it was a pity I couldn't see it any better or get any decent pictures. So dark! I understand ambiance and mood, but come on. . . My girlfriend and I had the Australian Oxtail bouillon with bone marrow dumplings. It melted in your mouth. The flavors danced on my tongue, and my stomach purred from its depths. It was that good. The dry aged, corn fed NY strips we got were phenominal. Night and day difference in that mine was rare and girly girl's was well done. Both cooked to perfection. Side of creamed spinach with a fresh egg on top. Wow. And the creamy polenta is what did me in. Perfectly executed both texturally and flavor. And I know, because I make this at home. . . We somehow sneaked in on a Saturday evening during the Mr.Olympia weekend, I think we just got lucky. Highly recommend a reservation.
I know, I'm super late to the Vegas steakhouse party, but to my bf's delight, we've been making up for lost time this year. On this last trip, we tried Wolfgang Puck's CUT in the Palazzo. . . Service in the lounge area was, to use a word popularized by Beyonce, flawless. Perfectly smooth symphony of waiters tending to our party of two. . . Foods: . -- Breads: pretzel roll was decedent with their Rosemary butter, onion focaccia was all flavor without being dense, yummy, long cheesy breadsticks, & sharply-flavored cheese breads. . -- pork belly appetizer: the meaty parts were excellent (I don't eat the fatty parts) . -- lobster, crab, shrimp cocktail tower: way too much going on; simple mounds of undressed, fresh seafood would have been better than throwing the lot together with avocado, sauces, savory pudding, etc., . -- bone-in ribeye, (aged 21 days) for him: generous 20 oz., cooked perfectly medium-rare, nicely grilled.. -- petite filet (8 oz) for me: cooked perfectly on the inside, a little more charred on the outside than I would've like . -- sauces ($2 each): house steak sauce was quite sweet, peppercorn was delicious. A variety of mustards were brought out for our steaks, an Austrian tradition. The violet mustard, which had a hint of a wine taste, especially brought out amazing flavors when added to our steaks. . -- sides: tempura onion rings (holy shit, these are good) & mashed potatoes (creamy/buttery). -- desserts: banana cream pie (only so-so) & baked Alaska (he really enjoyed the meringue.) . . Price of our food coma (not including tip): $240.
I love this place!!! We went here for our anniversary, and it was definitely worth the price. The service was impeccable, and the food was even more amazing than I expected. The staff is on point, and they work together as a team to give you exceptional service and perfect presentation. They took note that it was our anniversary, and made it really special. . . We got the porterhouse for two, which is seasoned to perfection and melts in your mouth. This was probably the best steak I've ever had. I have dreams about it. There were some reviews that stated that the sides were small, and so we ended up getting three sides to share.  However, that was unnecessary for two people. I would suggest one to two sides at most to share for two people. The mac & cheese was the best. . . I just cannot say enough good things, and I can't wait to come back.
I went to the Vegas location last week and came away feeling like if your not a big roller...don't come here. I made this reservation about two  months ago and for the simple reason that my wife is from Nebraska and Cut serves a very nice corn fed beef from NE. We had it in Beverly Hills and loved it and the service.. . We checked in at the front desk and were shown to a table right in front of the kitchen door. We were told its all we have. Wrong, I don't want to have a great dinner interrupted by servers going by our table every minute. Either poor design or greedy management. I was asked to wait in the bar and we should have had dinner there...great service in the bar. I was then shown to another table that was better...so they told me. No staff will go through here....wrong again, but I just wanted to eat at that point. . . Food is good. Wine list amazing, so i can't ding them on any of that. Ijust felt during the whole meal that I was not spending enough. Very subtle, but it was there. No bottle of wine? No dessert? Hmmmm, how about the $50.00 steak I just ordered. . . I get it, big rent and expensive brand. I think i will go back to the Palm where I feel appreciated.
I always check out places to eat when we decide to stay at a certain hotel in Vegas. We chose the Venetian on this trip. We ate at Carnevino last time so this time we wanted to try CUT. Checked out the menu online and the pics on YELP. The maple glazed pork belly caught my eye and also the selection of steaks.. . No reservations, we just walked in on Sunday around 6pm. Asked if we mind sitting in the lounge area, no problem, seated right away. Greeted by a server for drinks. Bobby the head server welcomed us and brought menus. He IS the man! He explained the menu and made great recommendations. . . Pretzel sticks were brought to us along with our drinks. Later a great selection of fresh breads were brought out. I had the focaccia and on a recommendation the pretzel bread. Both were delicious!. . We started with the maple glazed pork belly. Very good!! And Bobby suggested the American Wagyu ribeye, good choice. Good flavor and tender!! My gf wanted the Mac and Cheese for our side, also good.. . We were checked on several times by Bobby and other workers during our meal. My gf got up at one point to use the restroom and passed by the main dining area, she said it was loud. The lounge was much quieter. . . We actually had room for dessert, well at least I did. Browsed the menu and settled on the Baked Alaska. Yummy! Even my gf liked it even though she said she was full....ahem. After that, Bobby surprised us with a tray of desserts to sample. I don't remember all of them, there was a macaron, a pear jelly something and two more. All were delicious!. . I highly recommend CUT! I would also strongly suggest dining in the lounge area and if you're lucky enough Bobby will be working!
Ok a little on the pricey side.  But the steak here is really awesome.  The waitstaff was super attentive and suggestions where very good.  I ended up with the NY Strip and asked for medium-rare and got exactly medium-rare.  It was just super delicious.  Again on the pricey side, but at least they have really good food and service.
This place is great.  Service is top notch....may be best ever had.  Food is fantastic.  Steaks served simple and the sides served at the table.  Nebraska rib eye was tender and tasty.  The breads they bring are fantastic, big selection to pick from.  Had the cheese plate (ask if you want it before the meal as they only offer it post meal) it's great way to try some different cheese and served with some honey and apricot sauce.  Good selection of beer and wine and full cocktails.  Dissertation looked fantastic some in the party had baked Alaska.  For a great fancy up scale decode and atmosphere and fantastic steaks this is a great place.
My husband and I always go to a fine steak houses everywhere when we travel so we are no strangers to high end steak. This was one of the most disappointing steak experiences we have had. . . Service started out amazing- super friendly server who explained everything. We were planning on getting a rib eye - probably Nebraska and aged. The server told us that the American waygu is her favorite and the best in the menu. That being said we went with it. We ordered 2 extra ounces for my husband which made the steak around $130 for one steak. . Bread tastes great, especially the pretzel roll but it was all cold. My husband and I found this odd. . . The food came and unfortunately it was disappointing.  The steak was sooooo wood charred tasting. It almost tasted like camp fire. It was not tender and was actually hard to cut. It was not very warm even. It lacked salt. It was, to put it plainly, a mediocre steak I could have bought from Costco and prepared at home. . The Mac and cheese was some of the best I have ever had. The Brussels sprouts were good. . . Here is what really made this drop down from 3 to 2 stars. The server who was so attentive and friendly NEVER CAME BACK. Not one person asked how the steak was or we would have asked to have it warmed up a little. The assistants filled our water but never asked. We sat not touching our plates for at least 10 minutes when we were finished before anyone even came over to take the plates. It was truly disappointing. Finally once all was fine the server dropped dessert menus but never asked how it was. We wanted to get out of there and just handed her our card. The service and food lacked. If you want steak in Vegas do smith and Wollenskys or something else but don't waste your money on a $130 per person steak here.
Overall disappointing.   I got the 8 ounce American Wagyu ribeye for $88.  It was under seasoned and not very tender at all.   There was little to no marbling.   If it was $30 to $40 I would not be as disappointed but for the cost, I do not recommend it.   The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the sides were good especially the Mac and cheese.   Breads came out cold which was somewhat odd as well.   Definitely a memorable experience but not a good one.
Desserts are amazing! I ate dinner with friends before and stopped by To take care of our sweet tooth.. We ordered:. Baked Alaska  ice cream and marshmallow. Banana cream  unique
mm.... may i say.... supreme letdown?. . the service was spectacular, but the service, unfortunately,  does not make up for the lackluster steaks.. . . The mac n cheese and mushroom sides were great, possibly the highlight of the meal, but the steaks themselves were extreme letdowns. The Japanese wagyu was actually really good, but the portion that comes out in the $165 sampler is pee-wee sized.. The wine was great, surprisingly not overly overpriced. . . The interior was nice, service was nice, food was good but I was hoping for more "eureka!" from the steaks.
I wish I could give this place 10 stars, but unfortunately that would break the scale on Yelp.  . . My friends and I made a reservation for this restaurant for a Friday night dinner and arrived about 15 minutes early.  Unfortunately, our table wasn't ready yet which is not the restaurant's fault; however, they offered us a seat at the bar area and gave us complimentary wasabi peas, peanuts, and olives while we waited.  We were seated immediately when the time rolled around and got a booth that faced the dining area - great for people watching.  The ambiance is a bit loud and rowdy, but the dim lighting made it feel quite romantic as well.  We had two servers that night, and they offered us complimentary bread, parmesan breadsticks, and some puffs, which I didn't try.  The waiter also brought out the tray of raw meat so he could explain the different marbling in each of the steaks.  Quite impressive and definitely something I've never seen at any other steakhouses.. . I ordered the petit cut filet mignon 8 oz cooked medium well with the house made steak sauce on the side.  For the sides, it was family style so we shared the asparagus and brussel sprouts.  I liked how they portioned out the sides for us. I must say, I was originally planning to eat half of my steak because 8 oz is too much for me, but after one bite, I was hooked.  The top and bottom of the steak were crunchy and crispy while the middle was nice and soft.  The contrast of the different textures in every bite was amazing. What made it even more amazing was their house made steak sauce.  It was tangy and flavorful, and I noticed that I would dip each slice generously into the sauce.  So good I can drink it. :)  Wish they sold it because I would have brought back a bottle.. . For dessert, we shared the chocolate souffle, which was pretty big.  Once they brought it out, the server sliced a hole in the middle and poured whipped cream inside and placed a spoonful of nutella on top.  It was delicous! We finished it all in less than 3 minutes.  You would think that would be the last course to end the night, but nope! They offered us a plate of mini desserts - marshmallow, meringue, lemon tart, and jelly - on the house.  . . Of course, the price for the dinner was outrageously expensive, but that's a given when you're eating at a steakhouse in Vegas. I thought it was worth it, and you should too. . . Tip: the restaurant is located inside the Shops at the Palazzo.
Great modern steakhouse. It feels chic and not like a traditional steakhouse but it does't lose focus on what makes a great steakhouse great -- the steak!. . The parmesan bread sticks are amazing (free). The dry aged NY sirloin is excellent and they cooked it perfectly medium rare -- highly recommend it. They got the perfect sear on top too. They don't have real Kobe beef here but the wagyu they did serve was quite flavorful. The cream spinach was great though portion was pretty small. The tempura onion rings were okay. You won't leave hungry here at least.. . They do a great job with the overall experience though. They come out and show you the top cuts of meat and explain it to you. They also do a great job pouring the bottle and decanting it while explaining what to look for. The ipad drinks menu was a little weird cause it was so bright compared to the rest of the place and menus. . . I think it was a great spot. Not exactly cheap but that's what you expect at a steakhouse.
To start off the night we came here to Cut to try their Wagyu steak and compare it to a few other steak houses. First impression of this location was a great ambiance. My boyfriend and I were helped by Carlos and Ivan. They were really polite and attentive. The best thing that we had was the Parmesan bread sticks mind that we did order a wagyu ribeye steak that was over cooked and WAY to salty. Along with our steak we ordered the wild mushrooms and Brussel sprouts that were also way over cooked and seasoned. They did do a few things right which includes their cocktail drinks, service, bread, and blue crab appetizer. I don't think we will be coming back to this location due to poor quality of food.
