I don't really like to go to buffet but since I am in Las Vegas, I think I should give it a try. . Sure enough, the food was amazing.
I think I gained 10 lbs from the Wicked Spoon alone. I loved the wide assortment of absolutely everything from appetizing sides to delicious snow crab legs to braised short ribs to amazing desserts.....and must have gotten 5-6 places that I absolutely demolished. #fattyforlife. . Having checked out the Wynn buffet along with several other class Vegas buffets, I'll have to say that this one rivals the Bacchanal Buffet as one of Vegas' best.
After having a disappointing experience at Bacchanal, we did not have high hopes for Wicked Spoon.  However, Wicked Spoon was able to change our minds about Las Vegas buffets.. . We went on a Sunday evening around 4-5pm.  Very nicely decorated and the atmosphere felt more like a restaurant than a typical Las Vegas buffet.  They definitely don't have as many options as other buffets, but the quality of their food was better than other buffets.  For example, they had a roast pork belly (best dish imo) where the crackling was...welll...deliciously crackling.  Their roasted root vegetables were delicious as well (simple, yet the texture of each vegetable was cooked to perfection.  So good that I kept going up for it).  Their mashed potatoes and potatoes gratin were the epitome of comfort food. . . Their dessert section was also very good.  Their mango gelato tasted exactly like a ripe mango.  and OMG THEIR CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRIES.  I am NOT a fan of chocolate covered strawberries, but their chocolate covered strawberries were SO DELICIOUS!!  Whoever made the chocolate strawberries must have done a lot of thinking because they were P-E-R-F-E-C-T.  The crispy chocolate shell...the crunchy heath bits...the perfectly ripe strawberries.  If you are not a fan (like I was), your mind will be completely BLOWN by these. . . If I'm ever back in Las Vegas, I definitely want to come back to visit the Wicked Spoon.
We went for the $35 Sunday brunch, it was epic. All you can eat buffets are scary but a delight! . . The breakfast section had all the favorite selections, the Eggs Benedict was excellent and the bacon was crisp (there is nothing worse than soggy bacon). Eh. . They had a full Italian section, a sushi bar, salads and fruit bar.. . But the dessert bar is my go to always, excellent Creme brulee and chocolate mousse!. . The Cosmopolitan has great restaurants, yummy!!
Wicked Spoon is like a buffet on steroids. There are just far too many options to choose from! We got an early start so when we arrived it was pretty empty.. . I always start with breakfast items so I had bites of cinnamon rolls, eggs, bacon and fruit. There are about 20-30 stations which ranged from fruit to omelettes to soup to hand carved meats. Shrimp cocktail was a big hit! The buffet price included drinks such as coffee and juices.. . I also loved the dessert area! The gelato was a big hit. . . So why 4 stars? Items kept changing when running low, not replenished. So when I thought I had tried everything I wanted new stuff appeared. That frustrated me.
Heard A LOT of good things about this place but somehow I don't seem what all the good rants about this place where. I came with high expectations due to the fact that friends and colleagues but they have come to disappoint me in Las Vegas. We came around 1 so it was considered to be the brunch time. It was majority breakfast food with some salads, and other lunch options. . But what I ca say was good was their chicken wings, saian chow meain and fried rie, the alfredo pasta, and the calamari skewer. Everything else was just plain jane to my eyes and my stomach. All my friends know that i'm a huge dessert fanatic so I went big on the dessert bar, but I only find just a mere of the plates appealing and taste worthy. The chocolate dipped strawberries, cheesecake and the thai ice cream were my favorites out of my whole plate! THE THAI TEA ICE CREAM IS THE ONLY REASON WHY I GAVE THEM AN EXTRA STAR! IT is a must try for all my thai tea lovers out there! . Just your average buffet for about $30 a person with a okay food, with an exception of a great dessert which was in fact the thai tea ice cream!
Probably the best buffet on the Las Vegas strip. Wicked Spoon is a bit on the high end of the buffets - $37 for the buffet and in the higher $40s for the option with champagne / alcohol. There are plenty of options - hot breakfast, various variety of meats, sushi and desert. The place can get packed but the line tends to more pretty fast. Highly recommended.
I love their pistachio ice cream
Very delicious. Lots of varieties from american, mediterrean, asian and japanese. Equisite food choices from quail eggs, anchovie, cous cous, crab legs, clams, oysters, steak, curry lamb, salmon...etc. . Dessert was just as fabulous. The bottle water had no smell or after taste. A must try if you are in Vegas.
It's fancy enough, but the selection is just ok. . As a vegitarian I found my options limited, and what was available wasn't amazing. :( . Our server was inattentive, and often MIA. . I'd skip it next time, there are better places to eat for $40+ per person!
one of the best buffets in vegas!!!  1st time here, wont be the last.  unlike the "more buffet", which serves 3 flavors of slop for dinner, along with hockey puck biscuits, and h2o..
As buffets go the Wicked Spoon at the cosmopolitan hotel is the best of the best of the best There are so many small unique dishes it's like it never ends. I love the shrimp with grits what a great gift. I also love the ceviche, the crab legs, and of course the sushi. Okay let's get to the deserts omg like 100 choices including the sorbets and ice cream, every item was better than the last even sugar free items, the melted molten chocolate pan was superb I am taking my best buddy Ron Jeremy there for his b day in March Wicked Spoon will lose money that day .
One of the best buffets on the strip. I like the tomato shots. Bone marrow delicious. A lot of good variety and very decent tasting. Ice cream bar to top it off with elegant flavors not just the generic flavors.
This is a pretty good casino buffet. It's a little pricey, but if you get the membership reward, it's not as bad.. . I went for Sunday brunch - the line was pretty long, but moved quickly.. . The selection of food was good. I loved how most of the selections came in their own mini serving dishes. (Tiny sauce pans!? Adorable!) There was a wide variety of cuisines and all tasted pretty good.. . Even though I barely had room - I had to get some sweets. The dessert selection did not disappoint. There was a lot to choose from and all of it was tasty enough. I loved the tiny tarts and pieces of cake.
Definitely one of the better buffets in Vegas and probably the best one on the strip.  It's located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel and everything in there is just extravagant and this buffet is no exception.  We came here last month and paid $40 a head for dinner.  We arrived at 5:00pm on a Saturday just before the dinner rush, so we didn't wait at all.. . The food setup isn't setup like your standard buffet.  Instead of putting all dishes in a large tray for people to scoop out of, there are individual servings set aside in cups or dishes that you put on your plate.  The downside to this idea is that you are really limited on what you can put on your plate and most people will come back to their table with 2-3 plates.. . Some of our favorites were the ahi poke salad, prime rib, the mac n cheese bar (choose the fillings and they'll make it in front of you), sushi, bone marrow, al pastor tacos, crab legs,and fried chicken. There is a huge selection of food at this buffet from all types and cultures of food.  The dessert section is huge and they have a gelato section where someone will scoop gelato for you in a cup.  Unfortunately, no creme brulee (my fave dessert!).. . We really liked it here and definitely would consider coming back again.
The line here is ridic and the food may not be worth it.  However, they do not rush you at all once seated.  Two hours of bottomless mimosas is certainly worth every $$.  They even gave us drinks to go which was fantastic! (though did not help my gambling). . To break it down: the food all comes on smaller plates, sort of tapas style brunch.  I was really happy with the breakfast options though thought the Asian cuisine was pretty poor.  The pizza was awful.  The gelato was the bomb and best option there.  I did not try the soup though think that could have been nice.  The best things, in my opinion, that you should make an effort to get are the following: short rib benedict, one of the pastas, lox, gelato, jalapeno corn dish.  . . If you are hungry, this is a place you can get the most bang for your buck --- just don't plan to head to the pool afterwards!
Four stars because we ate here the day after the Bacchanal Buffet. It's kind of like having the Rolling Stones open for the Beatles. Both are excellent, but way different experiences. Everyone knows you close with the Stones. Wicked Spoon is the Beatles to this experience. You feel warm, satisfied,  and even euphoric. You can almost hear Dear Prudence as you float from one tasting station to the other. It's a nice intro to Sympathy for the Devil you'll hear at Bacchanal. Both are excellent, but timing is everything.
Wicked Spoon used to be one of our favorite buffets to visit while in Vegas.  They used to have exotic meats and flavorful dishes unique from other establishments on the strip.  I visited the buffet a couple days ago and was severely disappointed in number of ways.. . The Cosmo decided the original price of the buffet wasn't high enough and have raised their dinner prices to $47 a person.  The price hike wasn't a huge deal as long as they improved their food selections and kept it unique.  Rather, what we saw were dry prime rib, flavorless shrimp balls and lots of generic foods you'd find at any buffet up and down the strip.  The place lost its exotic foods they once had.  . . Going forward, we'll probably skip this buffet as its no longer special and the increase in price really caused a decrease in quality.  Cosmo management screwed up what was once a great place to eat and made it mediocre and bland.
This place is not really mediocre, it's actually pretty bad.... . With the high reviews, you would imagine that this place is actually good, but no.. . I went there on Labor Day weekend, during lunch time.. . The line was unbearable, due to the holiday season and there were no express lines at this place.. . Selection was limited to none, there was no crab legs, no lobsters, I understand it's lunch hours, but at least there should be some premium food but there were none.. . Go to Bacchanal Buffet, it's a lot more worth it, especially considering the price range.
$20 to-go box!. . We didn't want to spend the money to sit in the restaurant and stuff our faces, so we decided to take advantage of the $20 to-go box (you fill up your box as much as you can). We were happy with our decision. Wicked Spoon does not have as many selections compared to other buffets and I felt that the quality of the food was mediocre. To list out some of their options: king crab legs, pizza variations, sushi, ethnic foods, dessert, etc., but none of the flavors stood out to me. We were fortunate enough to not have to deal with a line but we did notice during meal time that the line was horrendous. If you want to try this buffet, I'd say to go with the to-go box and take sample portions.
Came here with my gf last Monday for lunch and there wasn't a long line. We were seated right away. I've tried the Kim chee bone marrow, Prime Rib, and sushi and it was very delicious! Prime rib tasted wonderful it reminded me of House of Prime in San Francisco but in a thin cut way. Meat was tender and flavorful. I love how this place has unlimited mimosa during lunch time!   I'd come back again if we ever get a chance to have another vacation in Vegas. This is a must go place to eat!
Silly me for not analyzing their reviews better. Over 3500 reviews and 3 1/2 stars, what was I thinking. I was thinking I wanted to spend 80 bucks for 2 at an overrated, overpriced, under flavored buffet. This place is all hype I do not know what anybody finds appealing about this place. Your basically paying for presentation, everything is in cute little pans or baskets and Chinese take out boxes Why?!?!? I'm here to eat,  not get dried up rice in a takeout box. And the pizza was the worst I ever had, little Caesars is way better than that grease dough. Their customer service sucks from the hostess in front to the rude guys behind the food counters. Stay away people remember all those reviews and they barely have three stars. So why 2 stars? The chocolate cookie and their bottled water was very good.
Not a big fan of buffets as rather eat 3 well cooked smaller courses.  This place turns the buffet 90 degrees as though it still offers unlimited food and has the common unlimited crab legs which were a bit too cold.  It also has plenty of tapas size dishes which allows one to use portion control and to sample many dishes. I am glad I did have option to try 9 dishes as a couple of them fell flat like the mushroom carbonara.  I did not finish that dish but almost went back for seconds of the shrimp with grits.  Not worth the 47 dollars but I got a buy one get one free coupon on my united flight in which brought down price for 3 people to 33 per person which was more like its true worth.  The service gives this place its 4 stars as had to wait forever to get refill of drinks and we were moved right after being sat down.
Ok this is second only to caesars buffet, IMO.  Great variety, good quality, just a really good buffet!
This place is expensive considering how mediocre the food is. It's a notch better from average buffets around that aren't on the strip, but it's only because they make their food look nice lol. It's pretty cool how they portion out their food so a lot of it doesn't go to waste and you can actually keep track of how many servings you intake, but I mean, that's about it. . . One of my friends told me to visit this place because it was one of the "better" buffets, but I have to say, I was disappointed. . . The wait was long. I won't be back because I wouldn't want to wait an hour or more and pay a great deal for food that isn't worth a great deal. . . 3 stars for the gelato though. At least they got that right.
Not overrated AT ALL.. . Everything you could ever want is here. Very clean, and nice atmosphere. Food is presented well and tastes as good as it looks.
This buffet has all the amazing treats you want:. . - Some of the best congee ever! Only served during brunch and they even serve the fried donuts with it!. . - polenta dishes. . - bone marrow, such a treat!. . - extensive desert bar, complete with gelato. Try the Thai tea!. . - they serve great cold crab legs during dinner. . - omelet bar. . - plenty of meats like cured ham, roast beef, and fried chicken!. . - delicious pork fried rice!. . - salad bar with lots of different choices such as kale salad, watermelon with Sriracha, wedge with blue cheese, the list goes on!. . Only drawback is they don't have as much seafood as other buffets, but the other food definitely makes up for this!
Food was good but 90% sure I got food poisoning from eating here.. . Throwing up not once, not twice, but 3 times is never fun.. . Try anywhere else.
I been to buffets and I've been to BUFFETS! Wicked Spoon is the latter! This was my first time here and I have to say that the quality of food is phenomenal.  I went on a Saturday evening and it wasn't that crowded..yet. Our party of five got seated really quickly. However it's a bit of a walk to get to and find as it's pretty much on the other side of the casino on the second floor beyond Marquee (nice and quiet), just follow the signs and you should be fine.. As for the food, there is so much variety ranging from Chinese to Japanese to American.  What's really cool is the plating and presentation of the food. It's a bit cumbersome and I have to wonder, how do I fit this tiny dish on my regular dish piled already with food. Well you can either balance it or come back for another round, especially if your plate is filled with the prime rib and crab legs!. The desserts are really good.  I sampled all the pretty looking ones, and the flavor is amazing. The gellato bar is also highly recommended as well. I would definitely come back again next time I'm in Vegas.
Best buffet I have been to in Las Vegas, both in terms of quality of food and presentation. Delicious duck, lamb, and a wonderful array of desserts.
100% this is the best buffet in Vegas.  A trillion awesome food choices,  $35 with all you can drink mimosas. Service was outstanding. I loved this place,  we will return on our next trip.
I was devirginized here on my last trip to Vegas with my girls. People were telling me it's comparable to Bacchus at Caesar's, but I wouldn't know. Next time, people, next time. Sad to say, but we came here on a major club night, Saturday, and when we expected to be confonted with a two-hour wait, uh, no. We were the first in line, wait, there was no line. Everyone was at the club! COOL!. . I took my buffet fill and did what I could. My favorite was the roasted bone marrow. HELLA GOOD!!! I felt so guilty, but SO WHAT, I'm in SIN CITY, yalls! They had some other stuff I stuffed my face in, but this was by far my favorite!. . $45 per person? In Vegas for a buffet? Cash baby, cash. Cheaper than I expected!
We dined here on 11/10 for dinner as VIP guests.  We didn't bother going to the VIP line as the line was short enough for us, no hurry.  What a great experience over all.  The decor is hip fresh contemporary with a great flow, lighting and super cool staff.  We arrived during happy hour and let me tell you...this is the only place in Vegas where one can get a premium cocktail ($5) and a glass of Rodney Strong chard ($8) for those prices.  Amazing!  So, the choices for that evening where expectedly immense.  Not worth covering it all here, but suffice to say you will be satisfied from beginning to end...if you can make it that far!  Enjoy!
I did a lot of research about buffets here on Yelp and while it was difficult decide on which to choose, we're glad we came to The Wicked Spoon.. . I really like the style of the Wicked Spoon, most food is served in individual serving dishes so it is easy to have a nice portion without having the big troughs of food.. . We came for brunch on a Sunday. The eggs benedict were good, the bacon was good, too. I liked the tomato and watermelon juice served in individual bottles. The fried chicken was good in individual fry baskets.. . One of us paid the premium to get unlimited bloody may's for two hours, you can't go wrong there!. . The gelato bar can't be missed, though there were a lot of little cakes and desserts that I found it easy to miss. I passed on the Congee, too . . Some dishes could have been refilled a bit faster for my liking and the omlette chefs were a little too busy being social with other diners to take my order. . . Even brunch is no steal, but I guess none of the buffets on The Strip are any more. But it is a very nice place, beautifully decorated, modern restaurant tucked back on the second floor of The Cosmopolitan, away from the Strip.
Wicked Spoon is a ginormous Vegas buffet, but I think it has more interesting and high-quality food than many. Other reviewers have covered the basics, so I'll stick to the good stuff:. . The fried chicken wings are awesome. They come two to a little wire basket and taste like they were ripped from the back of an angel instead of a chicken. Maybe an angelic chicken.. . The Asian food in general is very good, with the exception of the fried rice (too dry). I think they also do a nice job thinking broadly about "Asian" food, including Korean and Vietnamese items alongside more common Chinese and Japanese dishes.. . The gelato bar is a must. Every flavor is fantastic. Ask for a waffle bowl to hold your scoops.. . You may want to wear elastic-waist pants.
This place is so highly rated, I had to give it a try....disappointing experience I'd have to say :-(  the food all looked delicious, but unfortunately looks is where it stops.  Taste just like any other vegas buffet if not worse.  I would say - not worth the wait or $, plenty of choices out there, especially you are in Vegas!
Came here for brunch and it was a nice. change to my usual visit to Bachannal and the other buffets covered by the 24 hour pass. eggs bennedict was better than Bachannal and I was pleasantly surprised to find bone marrow here, which was quite tasty, along with the "wicked" juice. I was too stuffed to get a good sample of everything, but I did leave satisfied. Service and ambiance was top-notch. . . However, if you're looking for quality seafood (especially shrimp cocktails and mussels) or a large selection before dinner, Bachannal is still your choice. But in terms of higher end buffets on the strip, you can't go wrong with the wicked spoon, particularly  if you enjoy the cosmopolitans modern/artsy attitude.
Worst service ever from a server named, Lisa. You'd think at a $30 buffet, some form of liquid would be brought to the table in under a half hour. I've been waiting for my second orange juice for 45 minutes. This is a joke. We'll never be returning here. Food is good but service, at least from this horrible host, is awful. She shouldn't be working here. It's not even crowded...
This is my favorite buffet place in Vegas and here's why:. . Food display - The appetizers, entrees, desserts are each individually served in their own little bowls or containers. Even though it's still mass produced, the feel is like it's a high class specialty restaurant where you serve yourself, and each dish was thoughtfully put together for you.. . Variety & Quality - We're talking bone marrow, fig appetizers by the salad, sushi, crab legs, prime rib, dim sum, gnocchi, shepherd's pie, bbq pork sandwiches made with steam bao, and even a custom mac & cheese bar!  Really something here for everybody, even for those who don't like buffets because they think the quality sucks. The quality of the food is better than some restaurants. Yup!. . Desserts - This is one of their biggest selling points, the perfect end to a wonderful meal.  They have beautiful pastries including macaroons and a gelato bar which is incredible!  Numerous varieties of cheesecakes and sugar free items too.  Just an awesome display that looks like a display advertising a French cake shop or a movie set.. . Overall, it's such a good foodie experience here it doesn't compare well with other Vegas buffets.  It's more like a fine tasting event where you get to go back for the food you really liked, and there's plenty of that.
Likes:  . Individual mini-plates that are both beautiful and tasty. Gluten-Free dessert options. Variety - they had a carving station, sushi, salads, cheeses and dried fruits, hot crab legs pre-split, soups, and so much more!. . Dislikes: . Price, I expected more unique items for the price.  . I mean, fried rice in little Chinese take out boxes? Come on.
Food was great but all of the bottles of champaign we received were expired. One was a year old! Not ok.
This place was great. We were staying at the Cosmopolitan so it was almost a given to give this place a try. I love the idea that they had items on individual small plates to separate them from some of the main dishes. There were a lot of selection on the food choices and the dessert was delicious, plus they have gelato.!!
With much expectations I visited here while staying over in Cosmopolitan.  Sunday dinner line was a bit long even though I saw lots of empty tables. The food isn't what I thought it would be. Some of the meats were really dry. Avoid the crab legs as they tasted like water down defrosted legs. Living in MD did raise my standards on seafood. Most of the food is contained in little metal or glass containers and looks good to eat but the taste isn't what I thought it would be.
My girlfriend and I drove out to Vegas for her 21st birthday.  We had heard about the Wicked Spoon about 8 months prior to this trip, so we were really excited to finally be able to eat here!  We were most definitely not disappointed.  The majority of the food, which was served on smaller, portion sized plates, was very well cooked.  The maple chestnut risotto and the ahi tuna slices were absolutely fantastic!  The wicked fried chicken was also extremely delicious!  There were a couple of dishes that weren't quite up there in quality, such as the fried rice and most of the Mexican food section.  The service was great through!  Always a full glass on our table!. . The standout of the meal, however, was the dessert section by far.  There were so many options, but the gelato and chocolate raspberry tarts were fantastic!  Even the peach cobbler was delicious!  . . We will definitely be visiting again on our next trip out to the strip!
Ba-ba-ba-ba-BOMB! I went by myself and ate like a fat kid. I ordered the unlimited drinks because well, it's $12 for one bloody mary, or $12 for unlimited! That Hong was a feisty fellow too, always trying to refill my drink glass. The chestnut risotto was delicious, as was the beet salad and sundried tomatoes. Quite the lovely brunch spread, and at $27 per person, pretty damn affordable too.
Not as good as before but still solid.  Go for the meat and dessert.  . The wait times are decent and the staff attentive and efficoent.  Meat is the star.  Prime rib, roast pig, N.Y. steak and bone marrow all good.  The crab was tasteless.  Many of the dished seemed overcooked, especially the shellfish.  Sushi bar was forgettable with 3 options and 2 being california rolls.  Decor and ambiance is decent if basic.  Dessert had many options with some very creative ideas and most of them tasty.  I like the macaroons and gelato bar.
Pretty good. The food was unique. Most everything I tried tasted good. The dessert options are good too. I left satisfied. Great customer service and a reasonable price.
In the battle of the buffets, weekday lunch at Wicked Spoon was weak y'all. . . Half was it was wimpy brunch stuff and the other half was a less-than-impressive assortment of entrees. I'd been to Bacchanal a couple of days before, so coming to Wicked Spoon felt like a complete downgrade. For the price, the selections seemed pretty limited. Once upon a time, Wicked Spoon was considered the reigning champ of all-you-can-eat, but it's time forthem to step aside.
Wide variety. Real sushi (not a lot), not fake salmon. Lines are a given unless u go 30 minutes b4 closing at lunchtimes. . Flora up at the front area taking our $$ was very friendly and gave us some advice for the Black Friday event at the outlet mall (kudos!).
Brunch was great here!! Desserts were excellent ... Food was super good... Of course wait time was a bit long but it's worth it !!!
By far the best buffet in Vegas.  The food selection is unique and huge, but also has the buffet staples, so it truly is a perfect balance.  Hot, cold, desserts all are great, the only drawback to the big selection is that when there are times that don't get taken, they sit there for a long time and you can taste that.  It is the most I've spent on a buffet in Vegas, but it was worth it.
My family and I went here yesterday for their Thanksgiving Brunch buffet.   It was about an hour wait, but if you are a Gold or Platinum Marriott rewards member (and you get a nice discount as well), it gets you through the line faster.  We waited about 10 minutes after we paid.  The selection of items was incredible.  They hada lot of breakfast, lunch, and dinner selections.  I had some of the normal thanksgiving fare... the turkey was great.  The chestnut stuffing was amazing.  The sweet potatoes were incredible.  My two complaints were the mashed potatoes were extremely lumpy and the lumps were big.   And I could not find any cranberry sauce.  The prime rib was cooked to perfection.  They had some amazing Maple Chestnut Risotto.  They had some great salt-n-vinegar fingerling potatoes.  But the dessert station was incredible.   I had pumpkin cheesecake, a strawberry dipped in chocolate and Oreo crumbs, the best pistachio gelato I've ever had and some great blood orange sorbetti.  The service was great.  It was very clean.  The food was good and you could tell it was good quality.  It was a small step down from the Bachannal, but not by much.  It was a great choice.
Best buffet I have ever been to! A little pricey. But worth every penny. The presentation alone is amazing. Food was delicious! Ceviche was incredible. The mini carnita tacos were delicious, full of flavor. Pumpkin cheesecake was the best I've had. Our server was incredibly friendly and was quick to take care of us. I would definitely come back!
Good food but the crab legs are so skinny... Everything else was OK   GO TO THE WYNN INSTEAD
I guess I would have to agree with the 3-star review after havingtried Bacchanal Buffet during the same trip.. . I liked the presentation at Wicked Spoon, but it felt like they kind of hid behind their presentation more and made it as an excuse to have ok food. I didn't think anything here was amazing, worthwhile eating or even really deserved my stomach space after the first bite. I liked that I got to try everything, and everything was small, neatly packaged and very "cute" ... but that's about it.. . They had many gluten-free options, so I suppose this is a good buffet for those with a gluten intolerance? . . The wait was nonexistent on a week day, of course, but I imagine if I paid full price for this place I would think it's just ok. Their coffee cups are nice, and the staff are friendly but again nothing particularly outstanding about this place.
Typical vegas buffett. Nothing special and nothing worth remembering.. . Out of the ordinary offerings were bone marrow and 5-spiced pork belly. But they were all disappointments flavorwise.  Their king crab legs are sliced sooooooo thin it makes the Wicked Spoon look too much like bean counters. . . $48 for adults and $18 for kids age 5 to 10. At least the decor is upscale and the seating is spacious.
*Late review* . . Went to vegas for my birthday in October... ironically there were nooo good places to eat out here on the strip (in my opinion). Now this buffet was okay...great displays and decor.  Everything is served in individual servings and you get a wide variety of everything. The servers were quick and friendly. The mac and maroons were my fav.. ohh and the gelato bar overall the food was good, not omg amazing.... it was just good. Lol I must say i had alot of fun here.
