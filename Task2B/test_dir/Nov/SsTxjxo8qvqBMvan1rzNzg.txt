Yum Yum Yum! Love the taste of the food. For the price, the serving portion is very giving! Their bagels are also delicious! Come early for breakfast and odd hours during the day, the wait can take long. They do their best to turn tables over though.
I think I found this place sometime in the early 90's and I used to come here every time I was in town, which was several times a year before I moved here.  It's just a comfortable place to go in a Vegas-style atmosphere.  The portions are huge, the food is consistently good and served quickly.  It's not fine dining, it's a diner and for a diner, the food is just what I expect, so I've always been happy here. Some of the servers are better than others, but for the most part everybody is friendly.. . It's a favorite of mine for breakfast.  I used to schedule morning meetings here all the time before conventions or lunchtime when my office was nearby...although I could never manage to eat my full plate without feeling like a glutton.  Now I often bring out of town visitors here if they haven't tried it and the reaction is almost universally positive.. . It's really a fun and memorable place to go whether you are a tourist or a local and I recommend trying it out.
I don't give 5stars easily. This place was SO good!! My husband and I shared the fruit fantasia waffle & munch's breakfast. So delicious!! The waffle was covered in fresh fruit and came with a delicious sauce that wasn't too sweet. Munch's was equally as good. Totally recommend this place & worth the wait!!
Food looks good but service is HORRIBLE!!! Do not come here if you have a big group! They will tell you a certain to expect to wait, which is normal to wait a little longer. And then when you check back after u have waited for the time they told you to wait, they will add on another 20 minutes??? Ok. So you wait and in the meanwhile you see about 5 more parties of three and four go in front of you. HORRIBLE!! And all they can say is "its going to be a longer wait cause you have a big party". Yeah no sh*t! But you've been waiting for the longest time while you are seeing others get seated. In my opinion not worth the wait. Avoid this place and go to Denny's which is right next to it. (Only if you have a big group) cause obviously you get seated quicker if you have about 3 people with you. =\
Anything and almost everything you'd want in a coffee shop. Great prices, selection, huge servings and 24 hour. Very "Vegas" style, great bar too and great desserts. You can't go wrong here.....
Pretty serious portions!!!. The omlettes are huge, and come with a muffin too!!. Service is generally fast and sweet. . There is often a wait in the morning to early afternoon . . . It moves fast but can some times be in excess of 30 mins. . So come hungry. . . .And patient if possible. . But overall, good quality food and very reasonable prices. . Close to Riviera and Circus casinos.
Biggest baddest breakfast on the Strip. Don't come here if your not hungry. Great old school Vegas vibe.
The peppermill was right beside my hotel and luckily the first place I happened upon when attempting to walk the strip. It looked busy and busy usually means good so we walked in. . definitely unusual decor... I don't really even know how to describe it ... sort of like mid century design... 80's-90's color palette ... steakhouse meets juke joint breakfast diner? . But I do have to say the atmosphere was great.. As I said, it was busy. We were quoted a wait time of 25 mins and were seated in probably 10. the greeter sat us and Jen (our server) got our drinks. She did not forget to check back on us in a timely fashion after we said we needed time to look at the menu even though she was pretty swamped with tables.  AND she was really warm, attentive and friendly throughout our meal. . The cup of coffee was HUGE... like a 16 ounce pint glass with a handle on it. which is fine by me, I love coffee! . I might mention the greeter warned us that their portions were large. The cup of coffee reminded me she wasn't kidding. . So instead of ordering waffles with a side of blah blah, I got the bacon and eggs with a side of hash browns and a ... bagel with cream cheese? No kidding? And like, SUPER easy to spread  WHIPPED cream cheese... all part of the ordinary meal... yeah I couldn't finish. Really generous portions and good food! . My GF ordered a focaccia chicken sandwich with avocado and prosciutto. I tried the chicken (not having room to even finish my own plate) and it was really tasty.  The actual sandwich was really similar to a Torta. And of course there was a mountain of golden fries on the side... I did sneak a few of these and can say they were great ESPECIALLY with the house ranch sauce. . Good thing I walked about 5 miles of the strip after we ate!. I must say though that even after walking a LOT I was full until dinner time.
Lots of people in line but we were seated within a good time the food was great the service was excellent
This place sucks so bad when it comes to service for breakfast.  Had a waitress tell me she just started her shift and couldn't deal with me. Then has her manager wait on me to which they could not manage to cook the bacon.  Mean while watching the lazy waitress talk to everyone waiting tables including the manager. That was waiting on me not going back there. I got better service at Denney s.
Wowzers!  The portion sizes are enough for a small army. We split a meal prior to the Rock n Roll Marathon and glad we chose that. Saw a man order the French Toast Ambrosia and I think France declared toast bankruptcy.  Great food.
Very impressive, there's a reason this place has been a Vegas icon since the 70s. The place has the look of a combination of a bar from a 1980s sci fi movie and a local diner, and there are flamingo laden lamps above each table. The service is very friendly/laid back but one weird thing is if you order a drink they have to send a separate cocktail waitress from the attached lounge to take your drink order. . . As for the food itself, the nachos were HUGE and very tasty. They used real cheese rather than the fake, canned stuff and it came with lots of onion, black olive, tomato, etc. If you order ground beef, etc. it comes on the side. The Corona-rita is a giant margarita with a Corona bottle attached and it the perfect accompaniment to a huge plate of nachos.. . They have a gigantic menu and I'll be back here to check this place out again.
We stopped in here for dinner and cocktails on a Saturday night after friends we were traveling with got several referrals to check this place out. It's down the strip near the Riviera Casino. . . We walked into the lounge area as there was a wait for the diner side and decided we just had to hang out on the lounge side! The seating area is low back velour couches with little marble pedestal tables. There are neon lights and plastic flowers and mirrors! Oh the mirrors! Cue the 70's music!!!  The servers wear 70's style long black nightgowns and are very friendly. . . Ok food and drinks- we tried a few of the specialty drinks (green tea martini, oatmeal cookie martini with ice cream of course, espresso martini, White Russian). They make a solid drink here. We ordered a few appetizers- be warned they are enormous. Our little pedestal table was overwhelmed. The food on the lounge side was basic bar appetizer fate- but it's the atmosphere that wins here. . . There is a fire water table thing in the center of the lounge as well- very cool. Overall a very funky fun place to hang out. I will be adding it to my list of stops next trip.  . . Don't forget to break out your leisure suit!
Hehe! One of the best late night eats on my every 'business trip' to Vegas!! ;) awesome cocktails n great food!
The food is good here, portions are LARGE, prices are commensurate with the portion size. Diner atmosphere. Good service, full bar and always open.
Cool place with a good dose of history - popped in after an early show and it was mostly empty. The service was a tad confusing although friendly (why do we give our orders to three separate people?) and our waitress was very accomodating with our weird requests. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area and it is not super busy.
Food is typical diner food. However, the staff is excellent. Not to sound superficial or anything but it seems like they have unbelievably pretty waitresses working there, and lots of them. It makes for a nice atmosphere. The ambiance in diner dining is the best here.
Here's the deal, if you partying in Vegas and need to take it a notch down for a bit.  Get to the pepper mill and kick back and chill.  This place is cool and the drinks and atmosphere really gets you into just relaxing and listen to some old school.
This place is delicious!! My friend and I shared the Mediterranean omelette and an order of the small French toast and they were both to die for. We took the left over French toast home and it was even good served cold. The service is exceptional as well. They also have a cute little bar with a fire place which is perfect for a date night.
2 visits in a week, it's that tasty! My 86 year old father loves this place- huge portions, fairly priced.
I love this place. If you are visiting Vegas or a local this is a must. The environment is trendy and fun. Portions are huge so be prepare to share or take some left overs home. They also have this really cool fire-pit bar area where you can chill have drinks and appetizers while sitting in front of a water fire place. Another favorite thing about this place is their colorful sugar! So cute.
This is one of those places that are busy just because it's 24hrs, the food is very bland my sister and I had two different dishes and neither had any flavor I probably won't go back
