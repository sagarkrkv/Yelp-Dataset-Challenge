Locals discount.. Ate shrimp, clams, mussels, crab legs, crawfish, prime rib & all sorts of fixings. Some items were not as warm as preferred. Good desserts. Didn't really care for being seated way on far edge in area with out of control kids just because we had a toddler too. She's not typical and quite well mannered.. Updated 11/10/14 up all night sick from something I ate. Not pleasant.
It's no Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon, but it meets the standards of a Vegas buffet in my book.. . Been coming to this buffet in Rio since before I was of legal gambling age. On my recent visit, it's safe to say that this place hasn't really changed... and I'm ok with that.. . They have a large variety of food. Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, southern, and good ol' fashioned American food. Their variety is so large, in fact, that you kind of have to portion yourself on each "country" you visit in this buffet, especially if you want to hit each "country.". . Granted, food quality isn't as high as Wicked Spoon, but it's enough to satisfy.. . On my recent visit, they had a noodle station. Highly recommend their udon. It's not the best udon in the world, but it's pretty good.. . Their desserts are meh. Pies and cakes have that defrosted quality to them. But they have gelato! And they serve big scoops as well.. . Staff on my last visit was very friendly and kept our tables clean of used plates.. . All-in-all, this place will definitely do the trick, especially if you're staying in the hotel. However, if you plan on making the trip just for the buffet, I'd suggest either the other buffet in the hotel that has strictly seafood or just going to the higher quality buffets on the Strip.
Had great service from Matt . enjoyed the buffet. Lots of choices. Shrimp was perfect & crab legs were excellent. Guarantee to recommend & come again!
Was this a disappointment! The World Buffet, sounds awesome, it's not. . . First of all it's huge, and that's not a good thing, you have to walk sooooo far to get your food, and by the time you get back to your table the food is cold. . . Secondly it was like 40 bucks a person, way over priced. There's no way you could possibly eat even half the value of that here. No seafood, no prime rib or fancy carving station. It was all fillers, potatoes, rice, eggs, yuck. . . I'll save you the trouble of wandering around this ginormous buffet and tell you that Chinese was the best cuisine they had, and that's not saying much. Fried rice and won-ton soup. Probably could have ate at Panda Express for less than 10 bucks.. . The service was good, but service in Vegas is usually good no matter where you go.
Always good food at the Rio Buffet so many choices and variety of food. The waiter was so nice and the workers were great. Although I was disappointed I ordered a drink with a souvenir cup and it didn't have no logo or anything on it but on the menu the cup had the Rio hotel & casino logo on it
Good food and lots of it.  Asian, Mexican, American, even cereal!!  I wanted to try a vegas Buffett and I'm not disappointed.  It's expensive but what isn't in Vegas
This used to be the best buffet in Vegas.  However, with what it costs now even for Vegas residents its just not worth it.
The buffet continues to be outstanding.  Except the shrimp were over cooked today. The service today from Roberto was nice. We love the VIP service. . Huge selection of food. Many varieties.
Poor service, bad food and cheap setup. By the way price is no cheap. I wish I'd gone to Waynn and paid 10 dollars more for the dinner. I should have taken pic of the deserts to show what I mean... Filthiest desert I've ever seen, didn't even bother to try.
Went here on Sunday for brunch around 930 so there was not much of a line :) (I assume it has to do w the time of the year) Loved the variety my favorites were the crab legs, shrimp and beef ribs. I also enjoyed the omelette station and all the deserts, especially the coconut gelato, so delicious. I did not think the Mexican food was very good or authentic besides that our server was friendly and efficient. I would come here again
I remember the days of the past when the Rio buffet was super awesome, and then when it was cheap, and now it's just a normal buffet.. . One thing that the buffet has going is its massive selection. The buffet wraps around a long way and you have many different cuisines and choices to choose from. The food itself is good, but not great. You can still get the food you enjoy, get full, and leave happy. You can judge for yourself after you have eaten there if the food is worth it, but if you want an amazing buffet, buffets on the strip can offer a great experience. The Rio Buffet still has it's ups, but not worth the price tag for me.
