The front awning says greatest sandwich place! Quite a claim, and overall they deliver most of that claim! We shared the Earl's club. The bread was fresh and so was the turkey. It was nice that the bacon was warm too, as no one likes cold bacon. The lettuce and tomato was fresh. A very tasty sandwich for sure.. We also shared a turkey chili soup which was tasty. Overall very good, and we will be back to try other sandwiches.
Yaaaay first post as a Yelp Elite!! :D So why not write areview on my FAVORITE food! I know some people think it's lame that sandwiches are my favorite food, but I love them because you can put just about anything into them, they can be healthy and delicious simultaneously, they are easy to make, they can hit all the food groups in the food pyramid, the list goes on and on! Anyway, so with that said, I typically don't like going to sandwich places unless I'm shortchanged on time and want something quick, affordable, and healthier than fast food. Because I love them so, I am very, very particular about my sandwiches. Remember that episode from The Big Bang Theory where Sheldon orders a sandwich? . . Sheldon: Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on whole wheat.. Raj: What did they give you?. Sheldon: Turkey and Roast beef with swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.. *The guys look at Sheldon*. Sheldon: It's the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich, the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.. . That is me. I am sandwich nazi. I know how I like my favorite food. . . Despite all that, I thoroughly enjoyed Earl of Sandwich. I came here Halloween night with a group of friends who were shocked I had never been here before and wanted me to try it out. Thank you friends for making me try it! I've been wanting to try Earl's for the longest time. . . Sandwich: I ordered the chipotle chicken avocado ($6.49). It comes with grilled chicken, bacon, chedder, avocado, lettuce, and chipotle sauce. The ratio of all the items in the sandwich is perfect. I had a good amount of chicken to fruit/vegetable (avocado is a fruit) to bread. The flavor was just the right amount - not too strong but not unnoticed. My favorite part of the sandwich was the bread because it was atypical. It was toasted crispy and chewy. While I enjoyed the sandwich, it is not near the best I've ever had, and I do think the portions could've been larger. But for what it's worth, I'm not complaining, as I would come back again. What makes this place great to me is that the sandwiches taste fresh, all the ingredients are good, and there isn't too much bread to overpower everything. And in this case, the bread actually isn't expendable. A lot of sandwich places give humongous loaves of bread with few ingredients in between that when you get to the ends, you just want to throw away chunks of bread. Not here. Each bite of bread is savored. . . Venue: This would be my biggest negative. Everything involving the restaurant itself was great - clean tables, friendly staff, easy to read menus, a beautiful display of freshly baked goods, etc. But getting here is a hassle. After you get to the parking lot, it's still a 5-10 minute walk through the Planet Hollywood shops to the restaurant itself. Add to that the line you'll likely have to wait in. Even then, that's not the worst of it.  I'm somewhat obsessive compulsive about cleanliness and germs. Heck I've made programs for elementary schools preaching the importance of hand washing. Sooo, I strongly disliked the lack of availability in hand washing facilities considering sandwiches are meant to be held by your bare hands. There is no bathroom associated with the restaurant. You have to head out and find a hotel bathroom, and it's not nearby. There were no hand sanitizers that I was made aware of. I made do by forming a napkin barrier between my hands and sandwich, but it just wasn't very convenient. The one plus about this venue is that it's 24 hours. . . Overall, if I was already at Planet Hollywood or maybe I just had a long night out with friends, I would swing by Earl's and grab a sandwich. But because of the inconvenience in getting here, and the fact that sandwiches aren't too hard to make, I don't see myself coming here often. In fact one of my friends in the party, who was ranting and raving about how delicious the sandwiches at Earl's were, even admitted to me that the last time he'd been here was 4 years ago. If Earl's branched out I'd go more often. Thanks, Earl's, for providing me a nutritious meal after a long night of dancing.
A must-have for any Vegas trip. I have cognitively associated this fine establishment as the food of choice whenever I come to Sin City.. . Cheap and delicious. Just the way I like my sandwiches. $7, son! You can't go wrong with the Full Montagu. It's a true classic. Melted cheese...MMMM!. . I wholeheartedly believe their story of creating the original sandwich. Farfetched? Yes. Does it matter? Not really. Their craftsmanship is impeccable yet simple. The Earl of Sandwich has truly earned his spot in history, and he deserves a Nobel Prize for Good Eats.. . The line is crazy, though, no matter what time you're there. Seems like everyone and their grandma is a fan. It's located right next to the slot machines in Planet Hollywood, so it's a high traffic area. . . I always get 5 or 6 sandwiches to-go and bring them on the plane ride back home. They're that fantastic.
Stopped here twice for a sandwich.. Had the thanksgiving sandwich - wow! That was delicious!. it litereally tastes like thanksgiving on a sandwich! . . . . TIP:. Join there eclub for a free sandwich.
I an not a sandwich lover but this place make me scream to eat them everyday if I could! The best sandwich spot I've been to thus far out ofmy whole life! The first time I ate here was when I first came to vegas and I just couldn't get enough! So now every time i'm in vegas it's one of my go to spots! My ultimate favorite is the chicken avocado chipotle! It's the only one I get there now! Just the combination of all three make this sandwich great! It is definitely a must try for everyone in vegas! They will not disappoint! I'm a FAN!
Tried this place during vegas trip.. Their sandwiches are very delicious and vegetarian friendly options are available as well. Open 24 hours!!
I always make it a habit to visit Earl of Sandwich at least once when I'm in Vegas. It's  cheap, yummy and perfect for a quick meal. Depending on the time you go, they may or may not already have a line. I will say that the line moves fairly quickly, so wait time isn't too bad. . . I am quite a creature of habit, so I usually order The Original 1762. I have yet to experience bad service from Earl's. So far everyones been really attentive and efficient. I suggest you eat the sandwich right after you get it, while it's still nice and hot. it's just not the same when it's cold! They do have a good amount of seating but it does get filled up pretty fast, especially during prime time (breakfast/lunch). . . Is it worth the hype? They do have a good selection of sandwiches, soups, wraps, salads, and etc. Ordering process is efficient. It's affordable and open 24 hours for all y'all that need a late night bite. I think it's definitely worth trying if you're in the area and looking for a tasty sandwich spot! Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be sure to try something different.
Opens early. Closes late. Sandwiches are good. I've tasted the Reuben and the original. Both delicious sandwiches. Meat is well seasoned for both. Bread is crunchy as well. . Is it mind blowing? No. . Have I had better? Yes.  . Would I come back? Yes if the lines are not long. . . If you haven't been here before, definitely try it just to say you did.
I wasn't sure what to expect before coming here, I read some of the reviews and they had raving reviews for the sandwiches. When I got here I saw what all the fuss was about. Since it was Vegas I thought that the sandwiches were going to be about $15 or so and you'd have to wait a while for it. But when I saw the menu, I was blown away the sandwiches were only $6.49 each (for most) and after we ordered our sandwiches and were given the buzzer vibrating reservationg thing, about 3 minutes later we got our order!. . We had the Holiday Turkey, a Earl Club and a cup of Clam chowder! They were all banging. Starting with the Holiday Turkey, the bread was hot, soft and kinda buttery and it was stuffed with a whole holiday turkey meal, from cranberry jelly to the cornmeal stuffing. Delish! The Earl Club was just as fantastic with the same delicious bread and great crispy bacon, its what a club sandwich should be like. The clam chowder was good too, not the best, but definitely not bad.. . The portions were perfect too, if you ddin't want to be gluttonous, then the portion size is perfect, you should be full or almost full and if you wanted to stuff your face with dessert somewhere else or get some drinks after you still have room. . . Delicious,  cheap, and fast! Doen'st get better than this for a quick bite right on  the middle of the strip!
- Quick, cheap and delicious! . . I read some reviews before go and it is exactly how the major people say. I really recommend this place! . I loved the sandwich, the bread was so crunchy! I also liked th cupcake and muffin. The price is not the usual from Vegas, it's really good! :-)))) The sandwich was less than $7.00! . . The only thing that I didnt like: they only sell Pepsi, and I really dont like Pepsi. Thats probably some deal with Pepsi in Vegas, we only see Pepsi in all places. Please, let us to have a choice between Coca-cola and Pepsi!
I was so enamored with this place the last time, I had to come back. Man, oh man. Guess the honeymoon is over. This place has gone downhill. Either that or I came on a off day. A really off day. It was not even busy either. Lots of open tables.. . I should've gotten a clue when an earlier customer complained about how her sandwich was made (they had to re-do it twice as in third time's the charm.) . . So I ordered the Earl Club which is turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato, and sandwich sauce. . . I dug into my sandwich and was thinking geez, kind of skimpy on the filling. I looked at it's contents and my Earl Club magically turned into a BLT. I had a really long day so I actually thought that's what I ordered (BLT) and didn't think anything of it. But when I looked at my receipt later on I realized the super lousy sandwich maker forgot to put in the turkey and swiss. What a Turkey! . . A cup of soda is now 3 bucks. Don't think it was that expensive the last time.
The sandwiches here are alright but the price can't be beat considering everything in Vegas is very expensive. How other people really like the sandwich it is kind of like a cult following, I only consider this if I'm starving lost all my money gambling... Not that I gamble
After getting lost countless times in casinos and finding no end to endless halls I got extremely hungry. Nothing seemed to look good and I wanted something that I couldn't get back at home. I finally made my way to planet hollywood. I wanted it to be quick and cheap so I stumble upon Earl of Sandwich. The lady that rung me up was very nice. She was able to tell me her favorites and what are the most popular dishes. I had a chipotle chicken sandwich. It was delicious. It had a spiciness and a cheesiness that just hit the spot  for me. The place was crowded because I was in las vegas, but the wait was no more than 5 minutes. If you need a quick bite or snack head to this place for a filling sandwich.
As far as Sandwiches go this is DA BOMB!!! just so consistently good at all hours of the day and night, ingredients are fresh, bread is always perfect, i hope that every foodie gets a chance to try this place because its worth the wait in line if its busy, worth every penny if your broke, and definitely a great place to eat if your in a drunken stupor. I also tried the soup, they are nothing special but its good enough for a fast food joint.  BEST SANDWICHES I'VE EVER HAD.
Best. Sandwiches. Ever. I love that it's 24/7, fast, cheap, & super delicious! My fav is the Montagu sandwich! Must try!!! ^_^
I was here last weekend to try there sandwich and I must say I was impressed. The ratings speaks for itself! I ordered the Earls Club sandwich and the mac and cheese. I love there mac and cheese here definitely would come back for that. . . Sandwich was served hot and the cheese melts in your mouth it was so delicious!. . Hope they build a Earl Sandwich in the Bay Area I'd definitely hit up that spot more often.
Good food but takes a long time to ring up.
After returning to Earl of Sandwich last night for a quick bite with a friend after an event in the Miracle Mile Shops I came to a realization. These sandwiches are really only OKAY, but they may be much better than okay if you are drunk and have been roaming the Strip all night.. . I don't think much has changed since they opened, it is the same line-up (lots of people) eating there a majority of the time. There was a line when my friend and I ate here around 7:30 PM on a Thursday night. You get a buzzer and you then can find a table or stand around if you are taking your sandwich to go.. . I had the Chicken Bacon Avocado, which had a good part and a not so good part. Good part was the Chipotle mayo on it was actually spicy and had a great taste. The bad part was there was hardly any avocado - a huge disappointment for me. Also, the sandwich I now have realized is not as amazing as it seems. Really, it's just another sandwich, and to be honest, it is smaller than most other sandwiches you will receive at other sub shops.. . Probably won't be venturing here again.
I got the holiday turkey sandwich, and my girlfriend got a chicken-avocado wrap. We both had small cups of clam chowder.. . My girlfriend thought the food was okay, but I was disappointed. It didn't live up to the hype. The chowder had undercooked chunks of potato. As for the sandwich, well, I have had better at Subway.. . Not to mention charging $3.50 for a bottle of Pepsi is ridiculous.
Waited 30 minutes for my sandwich while the rest of my party finished and the n had to wait for me to eat. Management was having serious trouble managing their orders. I Will not be returning.
This is always my late night go-to place after I've hit the clubs or need a late night snack. It doesn't matter where I'm staying, I will walk the extra mile to enjoy any of their sandwiches on their menu! Such a delicious place and the service is extremely fast! I've never been here when it hasn't been packed, but the service never seems to disappoint!
I've been to this shop in Vegas multiple times and in Florida. It's delicious. Every sandwich I have had has been great. The holiday sandwich is delicious and it is basically thanksgiving dinner wrapped up in a sandwich. The original is great too if you like horseradish. The value is great too.
Worst experience ever!!! And I frequent Earls often in Orange County and whenever we're in Vegas this location too. . My sister and I ordered and the wait was long. Then my sister got her sandwich and I was still waiting. And waiting. She ate gets so it wouldn't get cold. Finished and I was still waiting. I asked for the status and was told it was next. It wasn't. I waited still as 5 more people got their food and asked again what was taking so long. Apparently they messed up on my sandwich (I got the chipotle chicken with no bacon and they added bacon). Still I waited and finally got my food. . No sincere sorry. Nothing. I was pissed! I hope Earls reads this and does something about their production line. There were plenty of workers but still there was a MAJOR delay! Not acceptable. . Get tips from the Downtown Disney Earls. On point!
I've only eating here twice, once here in Vegas and once in Downtown Disney. Both times I've had the same sandwich, the holiday turkey sandwich. To some having a "thanksgiving" meal in sandwich form may not sound appealing but since that is my favorite holiday how can I resist all the holiday favorites in one thing. From the outside it may not look appealing but you definitely cannot judge a book by its cover when I comes go this sandwich. For $6.49 (regular) this can definitely fulfill any holiday meal craving you may have not matter time of year (Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing or filling for us east coasters, and gravy). I will definitely continue coming here and unless they stop making this sandwich I'll stick to my holiday turkey.
Post festivity meal that always hits the spot and is open 24hrs. I have been coming here after the clubs and have yet to be disappointed
SO good - this was one of my favorite spots that I got to try in Vegas.  Simple, but dangerously delicious sandwiches.  The Full Montague was SO delicious.  Highly recommend it.  Also, their mac 'n cheese side was very good.. . Not to mention, this place is SUPER affordable... definitely a great deal when you are on the strip!
LOVE this place! I always get the Original. Roast beef, bbq sauce, and some horseradish. Served up nice and toasty with a little pink on the inside. Perfect size for me. Always comforting and it's just around $6. The sides are OK. Tried the mac and cheese and it is somewhat, boring. I'd almost recommend getting two sandwiches instead if you are really hungry!
Earl of Sandwich is the epitome of the sandwich song.. . Let's refresh:. Sandwiches are beautiful,. Sandwiches are fine.. I like sandwiches, I eat them all the time;. I eat them for my supper and I eat them for my lunch;. If I had a hundred sandwiches, I'd eat them all at once.. . Earl of Sandwich is open 24/7 serving up $6 sandwiches. That's a steal in Vegas. Yeah, sure it's not as stacked as Carnegie's or Greenberg's Deli...but it's still plenty delicious any time of day. I thoroughly enjoyed my Pastrami Reuben (my go-to at any sandwich spot). The bread was crisp and the filling was savory and delicious. I really can't complain.
Whenever I visit Las Vegas, I would stop by Earl of Sandwich and order some sandwiches since it's a must when in LV. I've tried the Full Montagu, the Earl's Club, Chicken Caesar Salad, Broccoli Cheddar Soup, Chicken Noodle Soup, Potato Salad, Pasta Salad, and their potato chips. I haven't been to Las Vegas since 2011 but I'd definitely come back when I visit LV again. I like their Earl's Club and Full Montagu, the other options doesn't interest me and maybe I'll different more sandwiches when I get a chance. My family stayed in Planet Hollywood (Elara) whenever we came to Las Vegas because it's the best hotel in our opinion and the shopping mall is right down stairs!
Grear food for the price. Sandwiches are the thing to come for but the other stuff is okay. Price is great too. About 6 bucks for a sandwich
The worst. Philly Cheese steak consists of cold mystery meat and a hunk of cheesish run under a broiler. I got my money back and went to Subway.
not expensive and the sandwiches are very delicious .. it doesn't leave u hungry right after either!
For being Vegas the price is pretty decent. I ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich for myself and the italian sandwich for a friend and now we are both fans! The only negative thing i could say about this place is customer service. The girl who took my order was not knowledgeable in their sandwiches and didn't show much care for her job. The line to order took about 20 minutes. Maybe they should let her go and put someone else. Anyways, other than that i definitely say you try it if you're balling on a budget in vegas!
I normally wouldn't rave over a sandwich place because I normally don't do sandwich places, I have a small issue with paying people to do something I could easily make at home but I must give credit where credit is due, the Earl of Sandwich is worth paying somebody to do something that seems so easy.. . I went with a club sandwich and it was easily one of best sandwiches I have ever had. Bread beautifully toasted, meats fresh, tomatoes and lettuce fresh and just the right amount of condiments, this sandwich was everything I needed and more.. . My only issue with Earl of Sandwich was it was hard as hell to find, I wanted around in loops forever looking for it, I'm not really holding this against Earl of Sandwich as my horrible sense of direction was truly to blame. Anyway this place is worth a visit for sure.
Fresh bread and everything is quality.. I'm a fan of the Full Montague.  I will return to try other items on the menu.
With that many reviews and still grasping onto those stars, this place is amazing. They are fast and they are good.  My recommendation is the tuna melt. It's packed full of flavor and it doesn't drip everywhere. Although the line is long but we got our food after a reasonable time. The only downside is that the sandwiches are a bit too short for my liking. However, that may be because I liked it so much and it was gone in 2 minutes. I had to stand in line for another one. :-P.  Overall, a must try place if you are in the area for lunch/quick bite.
Pretty damn good! Small but very filling. The sandwich (Chipotle Chicken Avocado) was fresh and hot, great taste. Just enough of each ingredient; balanced. The bread was fresh and soft too! The price is cheap, but it's a far from cheap sandwich!
Cheap good fast and 24hrs at plane hollywood. Only a four star because some of the staff were just rude mofos. Besides that food is one of the cheapest on the strip. Good to eat when drunk!
Earl of Sandwich is a great place not only because of the food, but because of the people that work there too.  . . After my not so stellar experience at Earl of Sandwich, they contacted me to apologize and encouraged me to come back. . . I did, and ordered the exact same sandwich - the Original. This time, you could see their assembly line running like a well oiled machine producing my order quickly, and efficiently. When I unwrapped the sandwich, steam rose out and cheese oozed from the sides. The ratio of roast beef to bread was perfect and the horseradish was generous. This is the sandwich of my memory. . . Thank you Earl of Sandwich for doing such a great job!
Very much like Joey in Friends, one of my favorite things to eat are sandwiches.  I highly recommend Earl of Sandwich because it breaks the Vegas monotony of over-priced food and large coma-inducing buffets.  The sandwiches here are very reasonable and this place is open 24 hours in the Planet Hollywood Hotel.  It tends to get busy during lunch hour, so I recommend coming here later at night.  And when I say busy...it's a massive line.. . But why come here?  Oh only because their holiday turkey sandwich is the best!  Imagine Thanksgiving incorporated into one sandwich....that's the holiday turkey sandwich.  Turkey, stuffing, gravy, and cranberry sauce sandwiched between two slices of perfectly cooked, crisp, freshly baked bread.  I don't even LIKE stuffing OR gravy...and I love this sandwich.  That's how good it is.  I also tried the mac and cheese side and the caprese sandwich, both of which are good as well.
Drunken nights + munchies in Vegas always lead me to Earl of Sandwich!. . Decent prices. Yummy sandwiches and soup. Always open. I'm a happy camper. . . There is an almost cult-like following for this place, and I have to say there's good reason for it! Try the Full Montague, it's my favorite!
I got The Full Montagu! It was the best sandwich I ever had! Taste good, juicy inside and the sandwich was not baked too much!
Best veggie sandwich I had in recent past. Employee at order counter can be little more friendly or happy looking.
Amazing!!! Great sandwiches, coleslaw salad and strawberry parfait !. Original roast beef sandwich,love it,fabulous :)
Good sandwiches, good price for a filling & quick bite. The bread is really good, served warm & toasty. I didn't care for the turkey meat much but overall it was a good tasting meal. We had the Montagu (mustard sauce was a little sweet) & Club (sandwich sauce was delish) which I thought were good choices. The line was a bit long but not ridiculous considering it was a Saturday night & the service was relatively quick. I would consider coming back.
Delicious warm sandwiches and soup. A perfect fix for late night munchies after partying in Vegas. Comforting to have warm food late at night.  Use your AAA card and get 10% discount on food here.  We love the discount and the food here.
Had the Thanksgiving sandwich there and was pretty tasty with artisan bread.  Would like to have like a sweet soft bread to compliment all of the flavors of turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and gravy.  The wait took about 10 mins and reasonable price for what you get.
Yes, there is almost always a line. But, yes it is worth it. Honestly the line goes pretty fast. The sandwiches are delicious, albeit a little small for my appetite. You got to give it a try!
