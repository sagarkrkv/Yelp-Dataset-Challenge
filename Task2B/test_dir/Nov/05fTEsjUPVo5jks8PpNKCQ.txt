I came here because I read all the reviews that were good. Unfortunately, my experience was not as good as everyone else. Our food was cold. I think I went at a bad time. There wasn't a lot of people there so I guess the grill was not kicking out hot food. I guess they just gave us what was leftover hanging around in the kitchen. I ordered the beef ribs because most reviews said to get them and they were really fatty. Rolling Smoke needs to understand the average customer had good bar b que in their lives and know what to look for when eating it. I say that to say, I have a strong feeling the meet I was eating was not made that day. I think the meat was leftover from the prior day because it had a very older texture to it. The links were good but it is not hard to cook a link. The chicken was ok and probably would have been better if it was served hot. The best thing we had was the kick ass beans and cornbread. . . Lastly, I been in Vegas long enough to know that most of these restaurants have good days and bad days. Most places, you are not going to get good food unless the establishment is crowded and they are forced to keep making hot food. I went to Rolling Smoke when it was not that crowded so I believe they just gave me the meat that was cooked a day prior. No way that meat was cooked that day. I think they didn't want to waste money by throwing it away. In my opinion, restaurants should never risk a customer by serving old food that should be thrown out instead. We are coming there for an experience and we are paying top bucks for it. . . I have been to restaurants and had a fantastic meal, just to go back to the same restaurant and have a horrible meal. Therefore, I will try Rolling Smoke one more time. I will chalk it up as one bad experience hoping to get the experience most people on this board received.
If you love that smokey flavor...this is a must try. We got the sampler platter with brisket, ribs, pulled pork and chicken. All were good but I have had better in terms of texture (a little on a dry side for me) and a little on the flavor (minus 1 star). The really got the smokey part down where the brisket leaves the deep red rim below the charred tip.. . For sides we got:. corn nuggets -  which was yummy as I never had something like it. collard greens - i loved it as it wasn't too greasy or cooked with bacon. Instead they used pieces of the smoked brisket to cook it in. Delicious and less guilty to eat.. fried okra - never thought this was good but it actually was. . I wanted corn on a cob as one of the sides but they didn't have any which is the first I've heard at a bbq but since their other choices are good, i wont complain. . . Cost: Very descent. For our 4 choice sampler, 3 small sides and a soda to share ALL for $19.99!! I'm happy with that! . . Seating: Majority are in a big benches. Which you may have to share if it gets crowded. So for some you don't like sharing go when its not prime time or learn to be people friendly. . . Parking: Good amounts of parking but not a lot. Location is good for the boys who loves strip clubs because this bbq joint is near and surrounded by most of them.
Tried Rolling Smoke for the first time about a week ago & I'm already back. I got the pit special which included ribs, pulled pork, brisket, & chicken. it was all absolutely delicious. Their bbq sauce is unique and semi sweet but amazing. Both times I have come here the staff is very friendly and this time Big Mike was up front and actually thanked me for coming in and told me how happy he was I liked their food. Small business customer appreciation at its best. Would recommend Rolling Smoke to anybody. You won't be let down!
Had a hankering for BBQ. Which only meant one place, Rollin' Smoke BBQ. It is always a good sign when the line is out the door and it is well past lunch time. The line moved quickly and in no time had my order in for the Outlaw burger.   . . The pictures on the wall did not misrepresent.  This thing was a behemoth. Toasted bun, lettuce, tomato, chipotle aioli, enormous juicy delicious hamburger patty with american cheese piled high with red cabbage 'slaw and fried onion strings.  Normally these "kitchen sink" type dishes are a pain to eat as presented. But happily this was not the case. It all worked, the favors melded wonderfully and most importantly the burger was done perfectly. Cooked through and juicy as all get out. . . Left satisfied with whole experience. It's nice to have a down-home BBQ joint in Vegas.  So satisfied I ordered full slabs of beef and baby-back ribs to go!
given the hype, i was a bit disappointed.  nowhere near the best bbq i've ever had but for the price point and diverse menu it's not a bad choice if bbq is what you crave. could have been that we went late afternoon on a monday and the turnover isn't as high as peak times.. . we got the pit special.  i found all the meats to be average at best and quite a few tasted re-heated.  the baby back ribs were not enjoyable for me. the bbq sauce was nice - found myself adding a lot to the meat to help the flavor.. . the sides were excellent - we got: bacon potato salad, jalapeno cole slaw, and mac n cheese.  the cole slaw went well with a fork full of pulled pork (which wasn't all that good on it's own).. . banana pudding was terrible, i threw it out. i can make it better myself and i'm no chef.. . although i feel like we didn't really pig out to our normal extent, i was disgustingly full for the rest of the night.  felt like it expanded in my belly for hours to come.
Do not hire for catering events.... as the food was not bad the service was and is terrible.   I was not only over charge more than the agreed amount contract. . But also the additional labor request was a waste of money... they did not have the Staff bus anything as agreed.  Via email amd text message. We were prepared to hire bus staff from another vendor but they stated they had to have their own team bus the tables and serve.   They didn't do anything.. . Now they are not responding to any of the items we have in writing and i will have to bring in our lawyer. . . Not worth the headache. And if you saw the mess they call an invoice you would understand why they do not have any kind of business skill other than cooking.. . I would suggest using any other BBQ company in town to not have to deal with this chef and his lack of business. . One more thing.. if you do use them be sure to check the math .. as I had to correct it for them during this process
This food rocks, the best barbecue I've EVER had. Service was really nice, they were totally swamped, line up out the door. Fast service, line moves quickly.
I've been here about 4 times and every time was positive except once. That's a pretty good ratio for me. For me, this is the best BBQ in Vegas hands down. . . Let's start with the positive. corn nuggets. sweet tea. BBQ Chicken. baby back ribs. BBQ beef ribs . . I like the casual restaurant vibe, they bring you your food but it's pretty quick and easy to eat and go. Prices are reasonable-hope they don't change. . . . On to the negative-brisket and pulled pork was almost identical. One of them was dry and I forgot which one. One was good. Guess I should have remembered.  The mac and cheese was nothing special. BBQ beef ribs was burnt one time and small the next time. Collard greens-just ok. . . I would suggest sharing food to try more things. We get the same things each time we go and I guess I am okay with that.
We waited a while to get our food it was ok not as great as i thought it would be huge portions good to feel 2/3 mouths.
Ate here with a group.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Can wait to return to Vegas to eat their again.  I had the brisket dog, so yummy!
I've been hearing so much about this place, so when I was craving bbq I wanted to try it. Great menu, great prices, and friendly staff. The meat was seasoned well and tender. I ordered ribs and hot link and my boyfriend ordered brisket, chicken, and hot link. For side dishes we ordered mac and cheese, greens, and loaded mash potatoes. The loaded mash was really good, the greens and mac were mediocre... kind of generic tasting. I will go back though, and try new sides. The spudtastic looks delicious :)
Wow. What can I say? We found this place on yelp and had to try it. Got there right as they were opening and were greeted by the very friendly staff who helped us navigate through the menu. We ended up going with the all you caneat option for $25. Totally worth it. We got to try everything and had the staff bring us what they thought were the best options. . . If you're in Vegas this is one of the spots you have to try. You wont be disappointed.
Had a lot of fat on my ribs and chicken. Everything needed salt. Except loaded mash that was overly seasoned. Gave me the runs not too long after.
Pretty good! I'm not a big fan of beef ribs but these are meaty and tender.  Sides were cold but tender ribs made up for it. Mac and cheese not the best. Yams on point and greens good but they were stingy and they were cold. Container was half full. New spot just a hop skip and jump from my place and they deliver too!
Let me start by saying the food was good, once I got it.. . I came here for a business lunch with the rest of my coworkers from my office. I ordered The Outlaw Burger, and I ordered 2nd out of our line of 7 people.. . We all went to sit outside and wait for our food. Fast forward a bit to after everyone else has their food, I decide to go in and see what's up with my order.. . The lady checks my ticket and goes to see where it is. She comes back and tells me "it'll be right out". I wait another 10 minutes and see many other orders come out, but not my order. I ask again and she checks again, then tells me "just a couple more minutes". 10 minutes later I ask her "am I going to get a burger today?", so she checks again. 5-10 minutes after that she comes out and says "they have it on now".. . A full hour after I ordered, after all my coworkers have finished their lunch, and after every other table in the place received their order, they finally bring my burger out. I had to take it to go, since I spent my whole lunch break waiting for it.. . The guy who brought it out was nice and threw in some fries, but I was upset at that point. I paid $13 for a burger, even left a good tip when I signed the receipt thinking I'll be the nice guy who tips at these places, and the lady who caused all of this didn't even attempt to apologize.. . Needless to say, even though the food was decent, they just lost business from 7 locals, out of which I was overly excited to try the food here.. . We most likely will never be back.. . Thanks for the fries, mr. server.
Good quality and good quantity!!!. I had the pulled piggy sandwich with waffle fries, and my husband had the beef rib plate.. . The quality of their meats are excellent, very tender and very flavorful. I am quite picky about bbq sauce.... and theirs is really good... I slathered extra sauce all over my pulled pork sandwich!. . If you have a big appetite... you will not be disappointed by the amount of food they give you either.....very big portions! The beef ribs are gigantic.... We left full!!!. . I really recommend giving them a whirl, location is a little rough, and the ordering process can be a little tricky.. oh yeah, and the closet you step into to get your drinks is another strange aspect that you just go..... "okay, whatever"..... . I can deal with a few quirks for some good food!
I've had BBQ all over the Bay Area and in the South but this was the best I've ever had.. . We had ribs, pulled pork, chicken and brisket.  I couldn't believe how moist everything was.  I didn't use the sauce because is was absolutely but needed.  Its a new "must stop" on our Vegas trips.
I always think I will get my money's worth when I go to an all you eat so naturally when I was given the choice I chose all you can eat over all la carte. I shouldn't have done that because the portions are BIG! and you are not allowed to order more unless you finish your plate! The food was delicious but there was a lot! . . I started with the ribs that were easy to come off the bone and had a nice sauce to it. I loved the breaded catfish because the tarter sauce had a nice lemony taste to it. Bacon potato salad which also had a bit of chives sprinkled on the top. I like my potato salad chunky and not too creamy so it was perfect! . . The dessert was a hit and miss the black berry cobbler looked murky but I tried it and I wasn't too impressed. It tasted a little sour for me.  I liked that banana pudding better.  . . Some advice is to buy a la carte if you know that you can't eat a lot. I felt uncomfortable after the meal because I over ate. If I was to do it all over again I would get the catfish especially , potato salad and the banana pudding. Those were my standouts out of everything I ate. . . I liked that there wasn't really a wait and we were served right away! The service was wonderful ! They kept  checking on us to see if we needed anything which was awesome!
There is a reason this joint is so well rated and it's not the ambiance. The BBQ is excellent and the prices are very reasonable. My wife and I both tried a combo plate; $11 including a beverage, a side and two meat choices.  The bbq is nicely smoked and the sides are spicy good. The service is fast and pleasant. But don't expect fancy or you'll be disappointed. . Oh, with a Yelp check-in, we got a free dessert. Nice bonus. . I bookmarked Rollin Smoke and will return!
Let the picture speak for itself. A brisket, sausage, and rib sandwich with a side fried okra. Yummy!!!
I am taking liberty of writing this review for both my wife and I. I leaned more to a four and my wife a five. Rounded off to a five. My issue is not really a complaint but a preference. The barbecue sauce had a good flavor, but a little too sweet for perfection and not spicy enough. I got the stock flavor and did not ask for options so partially my fault. My wife loved it so much she ate the trio burger without missing a step. I had the meatloaf with an extra side of Mac and cheese. The portions are a good size and get a free dessert with a check in. The staff also seemed to care about their product and asked me three times how I was doing.  Would definitely recommend and return.
Ordered to go. Was delicious. Have a smoker on the side of the building, you smell when you re getting close. Had brisket, Mac n cheese, bacon potatoe salad, okra. I ordered the duo with brisket and pork as well but I'm pretty sure they gave me chicken. Oh well either way tasted amazing! Going back for sure! Also try the banana pudding! All desserts homemade. So good!
Everything's hot and tasty. Can't go wrong with the brisket nachos! Busy but always goes fast, perfect lunch spot.
Gotta try the beef ribs! Very pricy for a small piece but very tender and juicy.  The pork ribs  was okay, a bit tough but good also. The corn fritters are soo yummy!
And we got a winner here folks! May have just taken my #1 BBQ spot in Vegas. Nothing flashing about the ambiance, but some damn good BBQ! Ordered the Duo with Spare Ribs n Brisket w/ a side of Bacon Potato Salad. The vinegar based BBQ sauce was just right. Great smoke ring on the ribs. Brisket was tender and juicy. Go here! Trust the fat kid!
Awesome, Fast service even though they are always busy. Got a free desert for making an appointment with Yelp, liked that . All food is great, tried almost everything at one time or another, nothing bad ever.
Plain and Simple.....Best Ribs in Vegas! N'ough said!. Pulled pork is juicy.  Peach cobbler is my favorite and don't forget to order a side if Blue Bell Vanilla ice cream.  This place really smoking hot.   We live in Henderson but we don't mind the drive.
Well this was my first time.  I will make it short and sweet and to the point.  Yum yum yum.  It was all good.  I had the beef rib and it was super tender and juicy.  I had the pulled piggy and it was the best darn pulled piggy I ever had.  I had the burnt ends and that was not my favorite and I will probably not order it again but he sides made up for that.  Beans had a little kick!  The coleslaw was super unique and delicious and last but not least the little corn nuggets were tasty.  I ended my meal with the berry cobbler it was alright best.  I swallowed it all down with some sweet tea mixed with regular tea it was perfect.  I am coming back for sure to try lots more!  Mmmmmm..... . Service was good.  The staff was so nice and everyone said hi and seemed to care if they messed up to make it right as soon as possible.
Bomb barbecue!!!! They'll even com out to your event. This is good ole finger lickin good barbecue!!!!
