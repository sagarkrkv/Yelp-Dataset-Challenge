If I'm only going to judge it off of the food, I would give it five stars. Personality a little lacking but they must know it's the place to be. Everything we had was delish! I need to go back next time I visit vegas!
Love it, Love it, Love it. I come here on every trip to vegas for breakfast- shrimp and grits or the the hash- both the best I've ever had, excellent coffee and delicious pancakes too- the food is made and served with pride,
Great atmosphere, even better food! We came in for lunch, I had the blt with their homemade chips mmm. Would definitely go back!
Amazing food here! Split the breakfast sandwich and shrimp& grits both of them were excellent. Great service, quaint comforting space.
Early Saturday morning breakfast and wanted to finally try Eats since we were already downtown for an event. We won a gift certificate from a silent auction that was a Zapoo fundraiser, but sadly we couldn't find it...which would have been nice to offset the cost.. . The location is horrible--on a corner in front of an old apartment building that makes it seem like the restaurant is the motel cafe. Parking, like anywhere downtown is a big pain with the unpredictable parking meter machines.. . Looking around the dining room, we could tell it was filled with a lot of Zappos Hshieep. It is a typical hipster type of establishment where concept is good but execution lacks. The menu is presented on a clipboard and features breakfast and lunch items.. . I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with 2 eggs, country gravy, Chive potatoes and toast. I opted for over easy eggs and sourdough toast. The best part of the meal was the sourdough toast...thick slices toasted perfectly. The chicken fried steak was bland and the meat was NOT good. I know cubed steak which is typically used for chicken fried steaks, is the ornery brother of meat cuts which must be tenderized/beaten into submission to properly achieve a chewable consistency. This was not. The meat under the flavorless breading was like an old shoe. The gravy was scarce and made the shoe meat too soggy (note: always get the gravy on the side), the potatoes were also flavorless and boring. The eggs were cooked right. I would not get this dish again nor recommend it.. My wife ordered the 2 eggs any style with bacon, toast and chive potatoes. It was ok, nothing special and not really worth $11. Most of the menu items seemed overpriced.. . Service was friendly enough but one of my pet peeves is when a server sees that most of my meal is uneaten, yet doesn't acknowledge that perhaps the meal wasn't to my satisfaction and at least offers an alternative, then goes about like a robot (Hshieep) to bring the check, box the meal etc. No thank you Eat, there too many other better places to eat. Next!
WRONG HOURS. FALSE ADVERTISING. AWFUL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE! . . This restaurant claims to be open until 2pm. We drove 30 minutes to try it out, arrive at 1:40pm and the hostess explains that they will not seat guests after 1:30pm. I have never heard of a restaurant refusing to serve during their stated hours of operation. I really would have expected a small restaurant to care more about their customers, and they just lost their opportunity for any of mybusiness. . . Thanks, EAT. I will take every opportunity to drive people away from your restaurant when asked. You're supposed to cater to the techie crowd...get a clue about user experience
Heard about this spot from the owners of Sweet Spot Candy shop and been coming ever since. Definitely my favorite breakfast spot in LV, possibly I've ever had in my entire life!!! I've only ordered the Chicken Fried Steak (come hungry, it's a lot of food). The batter and succulent combination of savory gravy is a satisfying flavorful experience like no other. They master the poached egg. I usually get poached or sunny side ^. I've been wanting to try the pancakes but can't get away from the chicken fried goodness. The staff is very friendly and always in a cheerful mood. The atmosphere is very ambient and peaceful. Has a homely vibe to it. Location is excellent, after your meal take a stroll downtown or to the container park.
Good coffee! That's half the battle at most breakfast spots, phew! Had chilaquiles, not our traditional version but very tasty. The sauce and sausage were quite tasty. Friends had the has and chicken fried steak which I sampled(thanks!), also solid options. Come early or be prepared to wait, it was pretty busy for a Monday, I'll bet weekends are a zoo.
I can't believe I didn't review this place earlier. Holy moly wow. The shrimp andgrits all the way. The staff are attentive, friendly and uber fabulous. It's become a staple every time I come to Vegas. . . It's a bit off the strip for those of you tourists, but so worth the detour. Highly highly recommended.
I've heard good things about this place from a friend who lives out of town, so I've been meaning to eat here for awhile now. On a Saturday morning I get a text from my friend who says he just flew in and the people he was supposed to hang out with on the Strip are all hungover and sleeping still, so my husband and I swoop him up from his hotel and suggest eat. since we wanted to show him the downtown area. The location itself is very unique and just walking distance from Container Parker. Being from SF/Bay Area, we're all used to extremely long waits for brunches, so eat.'s 20 minute wait was no big deal. Once we finally got seated, the 3 of us ended up in a 2-top that was in a corner. It was very.. cozy, but what's a little bit of discomfort among friends? The hostess was very sweet and wanted to make sure we didn't wait too long, so I appreciated that. We ordered the corned beef, eggs benedict, chicken fried steak and pancakes for the table. The pancakes were mouth-watering, and probably the best part of the meal, but one of the servers did give me grief about asking for more syrup (I swear the dinky little serving they give isn't enough!) My friend ate all of his corned beef, so he had no complaints; however, my husband hated his chicken fried steak with a passion. It was very tough - just looking at it you could tell it was completely dry and devoid of flavor. He left a large chunk of it uneaten and didn't bother taking it home. Since we didn't have that much room on the table, I wasn't really feeling my eggs benedict, so I placed it behind me in the booth and stuck to my pancakes. As other people have experienced, waiters are somewhat hard to track down. Someone who wasn't are waiter asked me if I was done with my benedict plate and if he could take it away. It was barely touched, so I'm surprised he didn't ask what was wrong and didn't ask if I wanted to take it to go (my husband eventually ate it at home to make up for his lack of a meal). Maybe we should have ordered a few different items like the truffled egg sandwich, but my husband probably would never want to come back here. I came here wishing that we had spent our morning eating at Mr. Mama's since I haven't been there yet. Hopefully that place doesn't disappoint. Eat. does look like they have a pretty big and devoted following, so I hope they continue to do better and improve on the shortcomings guests have pointed out as of late.
Went for lunch and this place never disappoints when to food!  Had the grilled cheese with bacon and avocado! Delicious x10!  Our server suggested we try the fried deviled egg. He said it was a life changing moment.  We tried and WOW!  Let me tell you my life has changed as I will gain a few extra pounds because I want to eat those over and over again.They are for sure a must!  Just remember show up early because the place is busy and sometimes you have to wait for a table a little long. However worth the wait!
By BF decided to try this spot out on our last morning in Vegas. And I am so glad we did. We went on a Sunday...mid morning. I was expecting a huge wait. Considering this was prime brunch hours we ended up waiting 30 minutes,which isn't too bad. coffee was excellent! I love a good cup of joe. My BF ordered the corn beef hash. It came with poached eggs and these lovely pieces of toast that was oh so good. I got the golden brown pancakes which were sooooooo good. I love the buttery golden brown crust that they had. I honesty didn't need syrup as the cake themselves was bursting with sweetness. I would have given a 5 star rating however the service could have been a lot better. Our waitress only came by once, and the person who took our orders was the bartender....which i thought was weird.
Seriously the best breakfast I have ever had.  We started with coffee, rich, smooth, & not even the smallest hint of bitterness.  The cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compote... perfection.  How do the biscuits stay crisp on the outside with the sauce? MAGIC!  They aren't too sweet, not too dense, just perfect.  I had the eggs with chive potatoes, bacon, & toast.  The chive potatoes were savory, slightly crisp, and delicious.  The bacon.  BACON.  Perfectly crisp, not too salty, not too greasy, perfect thickness.  YES. Just yes.  :)  I had sourdough toast, it was like a texas toast, thick, a tad cheesy, and light.  FREAKIN amazing.  I don't care what you have for breakfast, but you MUST have the pancakes.  They have them as a single add on or you can get a short stack (2) and share.  I don't know how they get the outside crisp and the inside fluffy, more of that magic I guess.  I'm ruined for breakfast now.  a MUST visit every Vegas trip.
This doesn't seem like a great place from the outside however I was so impressed once I walked in... I was WOWd with the great staff, inviting decorations and the the food is outstanding. I had the short stack of pancakes and sausage. Best I've ever had. I would come back over and over A+
I can see where some of the reviewers are put off by Eat. It is a little intense. Long waits, crowded front, busy staff. It is not their fault they are so fabulous and busy!. . If you can look beyond all of that, there is a fantastic little restaurant here. The food is super fresh. I always enjoy going here. When it is warmer (not hot) the outdoor patio rocks! . . My tips...Go early or on a weekday. It is all a bit easier then.. You will not be sorry. The food is truly da'Bomb.
One chilly Sunday AM that we happen to be on the Eastside of town, we dec'd that we wanted to have breakfast and try something new. My husband wanted to go to Ellis Island, always a safe choice and unfortunately, would've probably been better off going there. . . So to start, it's downtown. Parking can be difficult, the crazies roam around-- deal with it, they're about to pass out to sleep lol. It was about 9:00am so there was a little bit of a wait, 20 mins for us. . . SERVICE: We were greeted by someone who we thought was our sever, turns out she only brought out drinks, ok. Server finally made his way over to our table and he was a borderline D. We were greeted with a very bland "Ready to order or do you need more time?", took out order and we rarely saw him after that. Everyone else other than our server was attentive and very nice.. . SHRIMP & GRITS: Lacked the flavor that I was looking for. Lola's has their version of Shrimp & Grits that blows this one out of the water. The shrimp was way overcooked, practically rubbery. Grits is flavorless so you have to add things to it to give it some taste and it usually mellows out a dish and takes on the flavor of the sauce that the shrimp is cooked in. Unfortunately, the grits  muted the flavor of the shrimp rendering it to be practically bland and an all around disappointment. . . CHICKEN FRIED STEAK: Tasted like it was a few days past its use by date, husband was so disappointed in it.. . PASSION FRUIT ICED TEA: The best part of my meal. WTF.. . AMBIANCE: Hipster and beyond. This is something that reminds me of what you'd find out in SF or SoCal. Menu's presented on clipboards, urban chic decor, great idea and if we went by ambiance alone, then this place would be 5 stars! Too bad, so sad it's not.
I loved this place. Got the truffled egg sandwich and it was delish. Everyone liked what they got. The servers were friendly and it was a cute, clean restaurant with good options to pick from.
The best cafe in Vegas. The food is excellent, the service is fast, the servers are pleasant, and the prices are reasonable.
Great place to eat a little bit away from the strip. Great food and wait staff are very helpful and friendly!
The truffled egg sandwich and cinnamon biscuits with strawberry compost is some of the best breakfast items I've ever had!
Best breakfast off the beaten path in Vegas! Delicious real food made from scratch. Best corn beef hash I've ever had. Not greasy. Eggs perfectly poached. My daughter had the mist amazing cinnamon biscuits with berries!!!! It was a little pricey for breakfast but with it, you get what you pay for. Very attentive service too. 9:45 Sunday morning they got us right in.
Let me get the food out of the way first. We ordered the corn beef hash with poached eggs, shrimp and grits, one pancake, tomato soup, iced coffee, and passion fruit iced tea.. . Corn beef hash and eggs - corn beef hash itself was good. Diced and goes well with the egg yolk. . . Shrimp and grits - grits had great texture. A good amount of shrimp but tasted frozen. . . Pancake - tasted like funnel cake. Not bad. . . Coffee - nothing special . . Passion Fruit Iced Tea - refreshing. . Here comes the horrible service. These are facts, not opinions.. . We were seated by a nice hostess and given our drinks immediately. Our server whom I will not name for his safety didn't bother to greet us or introduce himself. After we ordered and was well into our meal, not once did he come up to us to ask "how we were doing?" "How's the food?" Or refilled our water cups. However, he did all those three service favors for others around us. I politely asked for syrup from him and he gave me a blank face. Came back and put the syrup in front of me with no word. . . After we were finished with our meals and already annoyed, a busser comes to our table and asks (in a awkward tone) "are you done?". He stacked our plates quickly and never said a word further. Not to mention we thanked him for cleaning our table. . . When I asked our waiter for the check, he came back with it and didn't say a single word. I paid and left him a tip because I understand servers make their money off tips. I left him a personal note to let him know our experience at Eat.. . Extremely disappointed.... Our highly anticipated lunch at Eat. during our thanksgiving weekend getaway was ruined due to the poor service.
