Love this place. Whenever I go to Vegas, I'm prepped to drop a couple hundo at whatever, no expenses are spared when it comes to fun. But this shining jewel on the strip is where I can get a great meal at a fantastic price.. . Tacos are $2 or $3 each! Tons of meat choices: carne asada, chicken, lengua, shoulder, etc. They make them right in front of you so it's nice and hot. . . There are canopies outside for you to sit which are a godsend considering you're in the middle of the desert and it gets toasty. . . This place is a bit far from the Cosmo, Caesar's, and the like. Closer to Circus Circus but if you're itching to save some bucks on your food, then there's no better place.
Awesome food quick service. Quality is great I would come back if in vegas. I hope they open some in LA. 4 tacos hit the spot and the Asad fries loook awesome
aw man, this is a far, sketchy walk from the quad at 2:30am but worth it!. i kept going back up for more and more spicy adobada tacos- they were so freaking good.  i thought that the asada meat was a little dry but delightful nonetheless.. . this is not gastronomie, it's street food at it's finest and probably the most authentic taco experience i've ever had.
Tacos are fantastic but you may have to wait up to an hour! . . This place is right on my way home from work and I often stop here to get food to take home. The price is right but sometimes the wait is verrrryyyy long... The people who work there are always super friendly and it doesn't get more authentic than this. . . I would try to go there when it's not too busy but the asada and abodaba are FANTASTIC!
The walk from TI to Tacos El Gordo just beyond the Wynn was quite a trek (in my book) but to have these delicious tacos waiting for me at the very end was all worth it.. . Upon entering, you grab a red tray and follow the signs to what kind of tacos you want to try. I got the lengua (beef tongue), carne asada, and al pastor--this is probably the same order in which I liked the tacos (from most to least). Each taco is about $2 so you can get by with a cheap Vegas meal. Love the fact that you see the meat being cooked right in front of your eyes. The tortillas are super tasty and you can tell they are made with care.. . Yep, it's not quite upscale dining if you're into that for a Vegas experience but you came for the food right?
Vile. . . You steered me wrong, Yelp.  El Taco Gordo is disgusting.  You show up and there's a giant flat-top griddle.  You have to go to a different station for each meat you order.  (Annoying.). . My asada ("steak," in theory) tasted like little gristly chicklets of shoe leather.  . . I spent the rest of my night cradling my stomach in agony.   AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
This place is by far one of the best late night places to go. Their food is authentic and delicious. They have different lines for different meats and everything is made to order so you know that your food is fresh. I got carne Asada fries (it comes in two different sizes: small $5 and $10 for large) carne Asada tacos, and lengua tacos. The tacos were topped with a generous amount of guacamole which is always a plus for me. . . After ordering and receiving your food you go to the cashier to pay. It does get very crowded however the wait is not too bad. The only con would be that it is located a little far down the strip, but the food is very well worth it.
As someone who's traveled through Mexico, I can say without a doubt that these are authentic Adobada tacos.. Everytime I come to Vegas, I make sure I visit this spot. You will not be disappointed. Amazing!
If you can't go to Mexico for tacos, then this place can fill the gap for a little while- closest to the flavor needed (except for the al pastor.... there is NO real tacos al pastor so far....) plus most of the types of tacos you need: carne asada, carnitas, buche, tripitas.... good place, how about another location in downtown Summelin?
Across the street from the Encore- easy walk- authentic food. Try a little of everything. Winner.
Yummy tacos. Open late. People I ate there with last night are still raving about how good their food was. Have a variety of different meat to choose from
I've come back every day of my stay to eat these tacos. The food here is outstanding. They make the corn tortillas fresh before your eyes, with delectable salsas and fillings (around six or eight types to choose from---the spicy pork is the one I keep coming back to). They have mounds of radish and lime on the side, and they also serve really good grilled peppers. Plus, the people who work here are nice; they have to work like demons to keep up with demand, but they still manage to treat their customers with a lot of kindness. I love this place! Stop reading Yelp reviews and go here!
Blown away ! Best ive had outside of Mexico. Old school all the way around. All sorts of options but the steak and spicy pork win my vote for tasty over load. At $2 a taco and super quick service you really cant go wrong. Sit outside and enjoy the sunshine off Las Vegas Blvd. 5 star Ill be back (few times)
These are the best tacos I've ever had.  You must try the spicy pork tacos!  . . The Asada fries are great too but if you order them the half portion is more than enough for two.  The full portion could probably feed a few Poeple.. . The spicy pork fries are great as well.. . The line can get long especially around 1am but it's a great late night meal after a night of gambling!
GOOD inexpensive tacos. They have three separate ordering lines dependent of the type of meat you are ordering. Large seating area, kept clean. We all enjoyed our tacos, we had carne, beef, pork and spicy pork along with the carne asada fries. We all devoured each bite! I would recommend this place if you are looking for some good tasty not overly priced tacos. The staff all had a smile on their faces and seemed to enjoyed what they are all doing. The Tacos are made right in front of you.
My favorite place to get Mexican food. Lovethat it's open late! Though the lines are sometimes super long I feel that it's worth it! I always get a lengua taco, asada taco, and an asada sopes when I go there and it is delicious! I love the cheese they use as well!
Awesome and delicious $2 tacos. Blown away by the juiciness and flavors. Try their Beef tongue tostada and you will be in heaven!!! It's that good. They also have an all you can eat radish station :) pretty cool to munch on them to clear your palette in between tacos or just for a good old crunch... . . PS we paid more money for a cab to get there that for the actual food... But so worth it. So happy we tried it. Definitely coming there again.
Wow. just wow. I thought I expected some sort of king tacos but totally different. taste just awesome. This place will be on my favorite list in Las Vegas..       .   ...
This is a crazy good "street taco" place. $2 at taco! The is the deal of the strip!. . I love it SO MUCH! It reminds me of when I have visited Tijuana, then I found out that is where the original one is! YES - so happy!. . Don't be put off by this place, it looks dumpy. Trust me, the food is super tasty.. The Adobada tacos are my fave! It is spicy pork cooked "gyro style" shaved off one taco at a time! Was also introduced to a "Mulas" taco here. Which is basically a melted cheese, meat of your choice taco sandwich - OMG SO GOOD!. . Tacos El Gordo makes me one happy GRINGO!
best carne asada fries!!!!! we have to stop here every trip to vegas tons of meat and cheese and not pricey for the amount easily enough for two ppl with leftovers and they let u take beer inside
al pastor and lengue tacos really really good! hombres behind counter made  a good show of knife skills and a littlle showmanship on plating. clean tables and friendly staff. pretty authhentic for a chain.
I work next door at the Wynn/Encore, so Im at this place often. A top 5 place in town hands down...maybe higher for Mexican food. Believe the hype and visit this place. They are famous for their adobada ( spicy pork....not very spicy), but its delish nonetheless. Their adobada or carne asada fries are great an their tacos are authentic. . . Place gets very busy and dirty. So dont expect your meal to be perfect. Sometimes your tacos will be thrown together too fast and be below what they might be on other visits.
Kick ass tacos, open late into the night, and cheap.  This place is doing it right!. . We walked our way over here on our first night in Vegas, around 2AM.  They'e located towards the end of the strip, past Treasure Island.  The place was packed and right away we noticed the delicious smells wafting over from all the different meat stations.  There's about half a dozen different meat stations, which you line up at and order, then you pay at the register.. . The Adobada (Spicy Pork) was so good that as soon as I finished, I lined up  and ordered some more.  At the Adobada station, you'll see stacks and stacks of marinated spicy pork roastin on a spit, with a pineapple at the top.  The pork is shaved off the spit to order . . My next favorite was the Suadero (Beef Shoulder), which you'll find at the station with the big pot of beef stewing away.  This results in fall apart tender chunks of beef, packed with flavor.. . You have to eat at Tacos El Gordo when you're in Vegas.  I'll for sure be there the next time i'm in town!
If I could give this place zero stars, I would. The ordering process is horrible. I waited in line for an hour to get our tacos, on a slower night! The meat tastes like charcoal. The place is filled with smoke because they have no ventilation system. The guacamole tasted like nothing! I love runny guacamole but this one had no salt, no flavor, it was bad. I wish there was a taqueria like the ones in Mexicali, where I'm from, which is what I was expecting. Don't believe the hype! This is not as good as the original.
Omg!!!! This place reminds so much of Mexico. The food is sooooo bomb. They never let you down.
OMG!!! By far the most authentic and delicious Mexican street tacos I've ever had in the US. My husband and I we're in Vegas visiting for the weekend and came across this taco parlor one night. They have every possible kind of meat you can think of: asada, chorizo, adobada, tripas, suadero, buche, lengua, cabeza and more! . . If you ever find yourself in Vegas, you HAVE TO check this place out!
Located in a sketchy place a little north of the Wynn, these authentic tacos are satisfying whether it's lunch, dinner, or after the club at 4am. We came on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was literally packed with Spanish speakers so that's always a very promising sign. Due to the crowds, it can be confusing as to how to place your order. But there are different lines for each type of meat. (Adobada- spicy pork was in a line by itself all the way on the left). Have a friend stand in each line and order in bunches.. . As a group, we got carne asada fries, adobada, chorizo, and asada tacos. I think the asada was just ok on the tacos and the fries, and next time definitely get the adobada tacos. The spicy pork has so much flavor and the right amount of heat and watching them slice off each piece gave the reassurance of its quality. Chorizo also had a ton of flavor. I would definitely place Chorizo and Adobada above Asada.. . Also, they had this fountain drink that was some whipped Orange Cream soda that was delicious. Nuff said, tacos don't get any better than this.
Orale!!! I went from Las Vegas to TJ real quick!  This is a definite must when in Vegas. . . We are huge taco foodies and are always looking for the next taco place to keep visiting and this has made the list. Authentic Tijuana-taste in the carne Asada tacos as well as the adobada. . . If you close your eyes and taste that smoky carne asada... You will be transcended to blvd. la revolucion. . . When ordering: . -find a tray or you'll end up carrying your food . -stand in the correct line (separated by meat type). -be patient as the tortillas are being made in front of you and the lines can be lengthy after hours . -though not mentioned flour tortillas are an option and I strongly suggest you try them!. -do tip the taqueros if possible, as they are quick and efficient and can digest multiple orders as given; we had an order of 20 tacos all prepared differently and they completed them with effectiveness and a smile!
My husband and I came hereon the first night here in Las Vegas from San Diego! The service was amazing, the food was delicious and the customer service was great!. . We ordered Campechana fries and two adobada tacos and our bill was $9.79! . . The fries were loaded with cheese, guacamole and sour cream! My husband and I even asked the cook for extra onions and salsa! We loved the fact that he was really nice and didn't give us any negative feedback because of our requests! His name is Mauro and we loved him (: we definitely come here again! . . Excellent food and excellent service
Tacos not as big as presumed. But the tortillas are amazingly fresh and they are packed with filling and toppings. Disappointed they didn't have a pollo taco. But asada good.
This place is so amazing, and totally worth the long walk from the busier part of Las Vegas Boulevard. Even in the middle of July! . . I feel it's best to come here with at least one or two buddies. One, because there are multiple lines that you'll have to stand in if you want different meats. So if you want three tacos with three different meats that are in different lines, just bring two buddies! You can each order everything everyone wants and get it all hot at the same time. . . I highly - HIGHLY - recommend the cabeza tacos. The head meat is SO tender and flavorful, that putting it simply on a taco is the way to go. An absolute must here are the loaded fries. We got them with adobada, but the fries are so perfectly cooked and LOADED with cheese, guac, and everything you would ever want to put in your mouth, that you could top it with mothballs and it would still taste good. My bffski and I went here and completely gorged with tacos, sopes, horchatas, and a full order of fries for only $20. I was also so pleasantly surprised by the large outdoor seating area. It has a roof, so you're not burning in the desert sun. Perfection.  . . If you asked me to, I would probably fly into Las Vegas just to come back here. Maybe I need to rearrange my priorities?
