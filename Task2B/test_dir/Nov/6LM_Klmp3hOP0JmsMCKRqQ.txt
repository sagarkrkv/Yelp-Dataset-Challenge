The Luxor is a tiered LV hotel. The rooms are not updated but what bothered us the most was the bad smell, which management tries to mask with large quantities of air fresheners.
Checked in tonight, the room we were originally given did not meet our expectations. Sean at the front desk was very accommodating and went out of his way to make sure that we had everything we needed.  Can't wait to see how the rest of our stay works out.
We stayed in the West Tower on the 10th floor - I am going to give you a tip that will make reading my review worth it. Pull up to Valet instead of self parking . It's Free + tip like a buck or two you will avoid driving around in circles and having to park far from the room- I also liked the Men's Spa it was $15 for the day you can use the Steam room, Sauna , and Jacuzzi .
I just stayed at the Luxor over the weekend. Friday-Sunday and I loved it. All the times I've gone to Las Vegas Luxor is the hotel I enjoy to stay at. Even if it's one of the older hotels on the strip I prefer the Luxor. We stayed in the Tower Luxury Suite and I was beyond impressed by the room. It was spacious and very nice. Another thing I love about The Luxor is Evening Call, idk why but I prefer there beverages over Fat Tuesday. There staff all and all is very helpful and respectful.
Comfortable but dated rooms but below our expectations.   Stuck on 5th floor w no view and only good aspect was close to quick elevator.   $23 daily "resort fee" was a Total ripoff as they don't even have WIRELESS internet in rooms.  Pools were too far away and only open short hours.   For the $$ we spent, we expected much better.   Casino ok and Tacos and Tequila restaurant was very good!!
Let me just say that this is an HONEST 1 star.  . . I'm actually currently staying the hotel for a business conference, and we all know how much it takes an exceptionally great experience, or a terrible experience to leave a review out being prompted.. . Pros: The Front Desk staff is great, Including the manager. That's it.. . Cons: Room is a cave even though I upgraded to the "Players Suite", no WiFi in rooms and that would be okay if the room had cell reception, dated everything, restaurants are mediocre, pool sucks, oh and I just tried to call the front desk to see if there's a cancelation policy so I could move over to Mandala Bay and I sat with it ringing for 5 minutes.... . SERIOUSLY! Stay somewhere else.  . . **Management Note** If I deter one person from staying here, with that lost revenue you could have paid for 5 WiFi routers that would have increased this to 2 stars because I could at least work from the room.
Just checked in and found out that there's no wifi in the room, no HDTV and you'd think they'd offer a discount or credit to us disabled veterans on Veteran's Day Weekend. .... never stay here again.
I booked Luxor for my stay in Las Vegas before thoroughly reading all the Yelp reviews. When the date got closer, I was getting super nervous because of all the horrible reviews this place has. . . It's a big hotel. All the hotels on the strip are big, so of course the experiences will vary for each person. I thought this was a decent place to stay. It was my first time in Vegas, so I wasn't looking for a high end place to stay at since I knew I'd be out and about most of the day. . . The service here from the staff at the registration/check out desk was quick and friendly. The maids that cleaned the rooms were also very nice. I would always see them on the way out in the mornings, and they would always make an effort to say good morning and ask how we were doing. I've never had maids ask that at any hotel I've ever stayed at, so it was nice. . . Room was a good size. Bed was a bit uncomfortable, but I have scoliosis. So everything is uncomfortable to me. The room we had included a shower and a bathtub. (Go to the LUSH store in Mandalay Bay and get a bath bomb to use and soak at night. It'll relax the sore leg muscles from so much walking, and it'll moisturize the dry skin from the -20% humidity that Vegas has!).. . I probably wouldn't stay here again, since there isn't much going on here. It's a bit far from the places I liked visiting, but it's worth the price. It's pretty cheap, and I had no issues here.
I stayed at this hotel for 3 days and enjoyed it very much. The hotel itself, and the rooms were clean and modern. The lobby and casino are nice and well kept as well. There's a small food court area and a bar/restaurant, but not too muchgoing on. I would recommend staying here, it was very nice, especially for the price. The only not so great thing in my opinion is the location. It's towards the end of the strip, so it's not in the middle of the excitement and entertainment.
Stayed in towers during a conference. Room was big. Not in room wifi. They charge a resort fee of $30 that includes in room internet. Was told after check in it was only wired but there's no wire in the room. I asked front desk for one and was told someone would bring it up. It never showed up. I'll never stay with them again. Felt ripped off by the resort fee and they forgot to also mention outdoor pool was closed too so much for being a resort.
Customer service at this hotel is awful and the whole entire place is overpriced. Here's my experience short n sweet. I stayed there is 2011 a couple of times. Payed $100+ per night for this so called 4 star hotel and casino (not even close to that) Anyway I have been receiving emails since then saying I have 2 comp. Nights.I just called and talked to a rude customer service agent and she said that she couldn't find that deal and said basically I was exaggerating. When I come to Vegas I like to go big and have a good time. So let's just say I have spent a decent amount of money with Mlife. Well I guess this is how they do business and I will never stay at a Mlife casino again and will never drop one penny in any of their casinos. Great job u just lost a loyal customer. Maybe send your customer service good squad to the Bellagio to learn the real way to stand by your advertisements anddon't try to bait and switch someone that is ahead in the game. Stay away from these guys!! Hope this helps
This was our second time to stay at Luxor. Seven years ago, we stayed in the pyramid after a busy holiday season. We'd requested an early check-in after driving in from Los Angeles, and I thought that the smudges on the windows, the stale air and the light coating of grime could be attributed to the rush to get things ready earlier after what must've been a busy New Year's Eve crowd. However, arriving for a regular weekend in November that was not connected to a peak travel event, I'm not able to give them the benefit of the doubt this time.. . Luxor wouldn't have been our first choice, but because they had offered a fantastic rate and our activities were planned closer to that end of the strip, we felt we couldn't pass up the opportunity. We hadn't been through the doors in seven years, but the lobby looked pretty much the same. Not that a hotel has to constantly redecorate, but in a city like Las Vegas where constant change stimulates customer attention, you'd think that it would try to look fresher.. . The lack of freshness followed us to the higher levels of the pyramid. Looking over the railing while making the long trek from the elevator, the dimness and the sense of uncleanliness makes you think that you're actually in an ancient Egyptian tomb. There were four of us staying in three rooms on the same floor, so I know that I'm not basing our experience on one unfortunate room. As soon as we opened the door, the room smelled of stale smoke in a way that houses smell when every occupant has chain-smoked since 1972. Being part of the pyramid, the windows do not open, and there is no way to circulate fresh air. I awoke each night with the ominous feeling that I will one day be diagnosed with lung cancer from second-hand smoke inhalation, and this particular stay at Luxor will have been the cause of it all. . . The room's air was cold, but adjusting the knobs only made the room colder over the next few hours. It was 75 degrees outside, and we were wearing jackets inside. One of our group called for maintenance on his air-conditioning knobs, and another commented about some spots on the wall. I had noticed these, too, which makes me think that Luxor prefers the darker earth tones of their chosen patterned wallpaper and carpet so that you don't notice the filth. The furniture, as I remembered it, was the same only more scuffed and scarred than last time. The curtains were soiled where hands had grabbed the fabric to open and close them rather than use the poles. Surely Luxor can afford to replace soiled fabrics and circulate furniture that needs repairing.. . There was rust around the bathroom air vents, and there was nothing fresh about the bathrooms. I realize the rapid turnover of hotel guests in Las Vegas, but I would think with as much revenue as they generate that Luxor could hire more cleaning staff and block off sections for regular inspection and deeper cleaning. At the very least, the cleaning staff should be trained to look up occasionally so they might see the collection of cobwebs above the bed, which were the first things I saw each morning. . . Perhaps the goal of all Las Vegas hotels is to encourage you to get out of the room and spend money, and maybe the Luxor goal is to make your room so repulsive that you don't want to return until the last possible moment. However, you should feel like you can relax in your room without having to put on a Hazmat suit.. . I'm giving Luxor two stars because the friendly and courteous staff prevented the stay from being completely awful.
Everybody that stays here complains about how old and outdated the rooms are .. but its a pyramid  for crying out loud .. hahahaha . a long time ago was one of the few places with a club inside and was awesome .. now its almost as a dump as Circus Circus :)
Everything from check in to the concierge was a great experience. Only reason I'm give four stars is half the pyramid elevators weren't working so waiting for an elevator was sometimes quite long. Loved that it was on the "quieter" end of the strip. Only complaint is that we arrived on a Wed at 1030 AM and had to pay $20 to check into a room early.
Play myVEGAS & get two for one tickets for all kinds of shows here.  Absolutely worth every penny of the $60 we spent on Fantasy tickets!. . I've stayed here before my suggestion,  don't stay in the pyramid. It's dingy. Stay in the tower & you'll be fine.  You can book amazing deals on Mlife.com for MGM PROPERTIES.
I'm surprised to see so many poor reviews for The Luxor and that it has an overall 2.5 star rating. I guess it was written by people who were born on the lap of luxury, or expect from reality due to the fantasy of glittery advertising. As for me, I did my research in advance and knew very well that in exchange of a lower price I would get a hotel that is a bit farther along The Strip and rooms that look the same as ten years ago. But so what?! When you go to Vegas, do you go to stare at a beautiful room and sleep in a comfy bed all day? In that case, you're better off investing on a good mattress for your home than a trip to Vegas. As for me, I go to venture out and explore. A room is a room, just to unwind from the day, have fun, and get ready for the next day of adventure-- not a museum or gallery to admire. . . The lobby and everything else in The Luxor  charming, like just out of an Egyptian museum, a feast for the eyes of any lover of ancient Egyptian culture and history. The customer service was as good as can be, anything more would be as fake and robotic as American retail culture itself. I love the thrill of the elevators that go sideways, the views from 22nd floor, the fact that it's connected to Excalibur, which is connected to NYC... it was all as lovely as the views of the pyramid from afar.
I must start by saying that the visit was surprisingly descent because I wouldn't normally choose to stay at a lower budget property but being that it was only for one night I didn't think too much into it! Booked my reservation through MLife and upon arriving I stood in the dedicated MLife line. Now usually this line is shorter and moves a bit faster than the general line but I was less than satisfied at the fact that as soon as I arrived there was one 1 front desk agent working with more than 6 people in line including myself. I'm pretty understanding with waiting to check in but this time was absolutely ridiculous! I timed my wait and it took 18 minutes to check in and as I stood in what should've been an expedited VIP check in line as I watched the regular check in and they were moving faster! I would've been better off going in that line! Nonetheless I continued to wait and FINALLY I was called up by a fantastic front desk agent by the name of Crystal I believe! She was very professional and courteous! I think she could see the frustration on my face from the wait but once i was recognized as being a valued MLife member and upgraded to a nicer room my whole experience took a turn for the better :-) the Players suite in the east tower was more than I expected! Good Job Crystal!! So glad I chose to stay and will definitely book this kind of suite or better next time!  The room itself was spacious all though some of the furniture was a bit worn it didn't take away from the nice view and very comfortable bed! Look forward to returning sometime in the near future!
Fab hotel. Rooms look great. Only downfall is that it is a little bit of the strip. Not the best if your gng to vegas to party, kind of a quiet hotel.
I got 2 nights free from MyVegas.  Well "free" got me:. .  - A room in the pyramid, 2nd floor, view of the back of the building.  . .  - The beds were nice and soft - I liked the pillows. . .  - The blowdryer was about to die or take off in flight.  It kept making a sound like a piece of metal was stuck inside, and a burnt smell came from it.. .  - The iron leaked water all over the clothes, even though, there was just a little water in it.  . .  - We played slots, which paid out pretty much nothing, and no drink girl in site, ever!  We had to buy our own drinks while gambling.  . . All I paid was the $22/night resort fee, which is nice, but I wouldn't pay to stay.  We usually stay at the Stratosphere and I think I like staying there better.  Sorry Luxor.
Checked in to a room that the bathroom was not clean bugs were on the floor concierge staff was very rude. Would not have stayed if it were not a vacation package. Will never stay here again
This place is a crap hole. Stayed here approximately 4 times and progressively it's gotten worse. We are staying in the "newer" tower rooms. Motel 6 had better furniture. The dresser and nightstand were scratched, chipped and pieces of wood missing. To add onto that joy, every time we came back at night we had to fight for parking spaces and didn't get one tonight. So...we are now in a 30 minute valet line to park. Horrible. And never again will I stay here. Stay anywhere else and you'll have a better experience!
Solid, cost efficient hotel. Better than Excalibur, and treasure island. Luxor is almost an entirely interior based hotel, and is unfortunately not very central to the rest of the strip.. . Massive interior volume, and good restaurants. Pretty easy to navigate compared to other casinos. Rooms are large in size. Was in double bed in pyramid. Decent gym. Equipment could be a touch more modern and it could be larger. Water and towels provided.. . Big minus = no wifi in hotel room. You can connect via ethernet, but who plugs in their computer to an ethernet cable? My macbook pro doesn't even have an ethernet port.
Absolutely the worst resort we've ever stayed at. To start our stay, they downgraded our premiere suite and tried to put us in the luxury suite. Completely insulting since we paid for a premiere suite. Then when they changed it they tried to tell us that unless you've stayed there and know the difference they give you the smaller suite. Is that even legal? Isn't that flat out stealing from your guests? Then the premiere suite was plain and boring. Didn't even have anything in the bar. Like actual empty cupboards, nothing to purchase like every other resort offers. Plus the in room amenities if you can even call them that were cheap and only a shampoo combo, lotion and a body wash. Nothing for the giant tub, no shower cap, no slippers or robes. Anything you would expect basically they didn't have which is super disappointing since not only are we paying for a suite room, we're paying $20 a night resort fee plus tax on the resort fee. So that apparently doesn't cover fancy amenities, decent tv service for games you might be betting or housekeeping. Which brings me to the point that our housekeepers didn't empty the trash out of our bathroom for 3 days. So for 3 days it sat with dirty diapers in it. They also never vacuumed our room or bothered to wipe any surfaces. We even requested them to return to empty the trash on multiple occasions and it still never got done. I wish I could give them the benefit of the doubt that their housekeeping staff alone is just incompetent but I spoke with 3 separate managers, AJ, Brendan and one other whose name I don't recall, and I told all of them and they all said they would put in an order to have housekeeping return. So since the managers knew this and never made sure it got taken care of even though one manager claimed to have visited our room himself, I'm blaming poor management for this.. Now most people come to Vegas to gamble and like most people we placed bets particularly on the Thanksgiving weekend games which we expected to be able to follow on tv in our room. Well the 2500 TV they have doesn't get a clear picture. Not clear to the point that we couldn't even read the scores! The 3 "engineers" who came to fix it claimed first it was a setting issue, then said it looked normal, then blamed the cable provider. Even though the tvs in the hotel came in fine. Very upsetting and again dissapointing. . Then our 2nd morning here I was woken in the bedroom by Marijuana smoke coming into our room from an "unknown" area of the hotel and after opening our bedroom doors our entire suite smelled like a drug house. Wouldn't have bugged us that much if we didn't have our baby and I wasn't pregnant but we did have a baby and I am pregnant so having that smell overwhelm our suite for the rest of our stay was bullshit  to say the least. Their managers resolution was to move our room, again, which wasn't ok for us since we'd been there already for 2 nights and moving our baby and all of our unpacked things sounded awful. They then reimbursed us for 1 night stay and gave us a food credit which was a nice gesture but couldn't even come close to making us ever ever ever want to return to this hotel.. Besides our awful stay, here's a quick review of the food situation.. Tender steakhouse: upscale but overpriced for the quality of food and service is slow.. Public house: Justine was our server and she did such an amazing job taking care of us and our baby we left her a $20 tip on a $40 check. The food was ok, greasy bar food but decent happy hour prices for vegas.. Starbucks: lines are always long and takes forever.. Crepe place: awful. So slow and not even close to edible. How do you screw up a frappe? Don't put ice in it.. Backstage deli: open 24hrs. French Toast was pancake covered. Gross. Scrambled eggs quesedilla was good the first time but second time had way too much cheese. Cheap food no coffee drinks.. Food court: terrible. All fast food and unhealthy food. Krispy creme, McDonald's a bunch of other cheap gross places. If that's your "diet" then you'll love it but if you eat anything of any real substance  this is a nightmare.. . All in all~hotel gets zero stars but I have to give them 1. I'd never recommend unless I wanted someone to have an awful time!
So disappointed.  I booked a tower suite and went with friends who booked a pyramid room.  When checking in they decided we should all be together.  The person at check-in took forever (20 mins?) and finally put us in a pyramid suite (these cost less than what I booked but she never told us that).  I got to the suite and it was terrible.  It was old, the curtains didn't close all the way (what is better than the complete darkness afforded in LV hotel rooms?), the suite was weirdly laid out with a bathtub in the corner under the slanted windows that would have been weird to get into, the suite also was slanted downhill so when in bed you were going downhill. The bathroom door stuck, the toilet seat had a burn in it, and the fan didn't work but was full of dust.  It was pretty gross.  I spent about 10 minutes in there before deciding that I wouldn't be spending the next three days in that room. The elevator to get there is a recipe to vomit all over yourself because of the angle it travels at to get up the pyramid.  I went downstairs and changed back to a tower suite.  That room was SO MUCH BETTER.  I can't believe that they would have kept me in a pyramid suite for the same $$ as the tower suite.  They are drastically different.  Even though the tower suite had blue pillows with what looked like semen dribbles on them, at least the room was temperature controlled and not weirdly 90 degrees like the other one. The mattress was not great, I kind of felt like I was at an old Motel 6. I also thought it was weird that there were no extra blankets or pillows in the room.  The bf and I like different temperatures and I wish there had been an extra blanket for me to not be so cold in the middle of the night. The bathroom in the tower was awesome and had separate bath and shower, but the toilet was not separate and the closet was in the bathroom.  It's a weird setup for someone who wants to get ready in the bathroom but not while someone they are traveling with is pooping. . . I feel like it is a smaller casino floor than what I am used to which is nice because it's easy to find others you are with.
