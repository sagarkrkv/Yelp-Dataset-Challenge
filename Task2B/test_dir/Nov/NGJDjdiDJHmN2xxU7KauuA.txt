Horrible experience.  Rude staff.  Non smoking rooms were advertised. I have a severe allergy to cigarette smoke,  and selected a non smoking room which ended up being a nightmare, they weren't really smoke free. Neighbors would smoke and ac would suck it into my room. Bumped from room to room,  promised we were on non smoking floor, but still smoke poured in.  Offered "spray" to cover the smoke smell which would have created even more asthma.  Every time I called front desk they were rude and would say "what do you expect me to do. "  I was in tears most nights trying to figure out how to sleep having allergic reactions to smoke and flamingo staff who didn't care they were discriminating against me.  Don't believe them if you need no smoking .  They don't have any.  When we tried to resolve with management, they didn't feel we made a big enough of a stink as we requested being moved to warrant any recognition for how miserable and inconvenient our stay was.
Yay for $10 black jack on a Friday night! Woo woo! We came here to gamble and had a blast. Gambling goes a lot further here when all other tables are a $25-50 min. The drinks came often enough and the dealers were kind.
BE CAREFUL WITH VALET, THEY ARE THIEFS!. . A couple of weeks ago we stood at the Flamingo Hilton for the weekend. We gave the car to Valet upon arrival.. Next Day, when we picked up the Car from Valet, my wife was looking for her prescription glasses, she was sure to have left  them in the Car..... But they No where to be found, incl. the Case! . We attended our Seminar in Henderson, south of Vegas and parked the car in a covered Parking Lot, we did not leave it to Valet at the other Resort. . After the Seminar we drove back to the Flamingo and gave the car again to the Valet, since we did not intend on driving for the Rest of the weekend.. Sunday Morning we picked up the car from Flamingo Valet again and after we drove off, I was looking for my Rayban Sunglasses.......Again No where to be found and I remember leaving them in the car in its Case after the Seminar the Night before.. . Long Story short......The Valet from Flamingo Hilton has Thiefs among them. . Be careful what you leave in the Car.
Checked in and the hotel rooms were horrible!!! There were ants in there room!!! And my wife got sick and it took 20 mins for a manager to respond to my situation due to he was busy with another customer. I was acknowledged 15 mins later saying I will be right with you!! I booked rooms with the high roller view and got s room facing a flat wall which did not have any view of the high roller. Very disappointed in this kind of service!!  They could have something much more faster and respond quicker to my need due to my wife being sick. For everybody who goes here please don't waste your money coming here pay a little bit extra and get a newer hotel.
Check-in was a breeze because they offered on-line check-in and we only had to pick up our keys and not get in line. But that was the end of all the good things with this hotel.. . We got in the room though and the bathroom was smelly. It smelled of sewage. And half the closet door was unhinged and just set on its side!! (Picture attached). . We called guest services, the just sent a cleaning crew who just sprayed chemicals all over the room to cover the smell temporarily. No engineer came to fix the closet door. . . Before we left for dinner, ee called again to ask for sheets to be changed because we didn't want the covers with the chemicals they sprayed all over (i am 7 months pregnant) and we came back... The sheets were not changed. All they did was give us 2 extra pillows.. With stains on the covers!!
Horrible parking experience here.  Not enough parking for guest yet there is plenty of valet and rental space available .  Go figure
I will NEVER go back to this hotel! You will have your money and things stolen! Both experiences were a nightmare. Took my best friend to vegas for her birthday. We paid in advance for a double queen. When we arrived we got a single king. They claimed they were out of double queen rooms. Went out that night and the next morning was getting ready. The do not disturb sign was on the door. The maid was BANGING on the door to let her in. My friend was in a towel and I was in my bra and underwear. My friend opened the door a little just to tell the maid to wait and she busted in! Im frantically trying to find clothes. She does something to the phone and leaves. She says she'll be back in 15 minutes! Sure enough, she comes back. Doesn't even knock this time. Uses her card, slams through the door and does something again to the phone. She proceeds to tell us to hurry so she can clean the room by 4:30 (it's only 12:00pm). 30 minutes later we leave and call across the hall we are leaving. We return to our room at 5pm and the room is not clean. We call the front desk and they claim to have sent someone. 2 hours later my friend and I leave for dinner. Still no maid service. I go downstairs and speak to a manager and she gives me a $10 food credit for my troubles. (Oh wow) I ask for a late check out instead. She agreed. The room finally gets cleaned by 11pm. So helpful considering we leave the next morning (sarcasm). My purse is hidden the entire time I am in and out of the room the entire weekend. Two weeks later I am fraudulently charged $1,000 to 2 separate accounts! These charges are made to phone, cable, and energy bills in Las Vegas! Also, my $150 curling iron was stolen. Hope the b$&ch gets arrested. And she will..also, our room smelled entirely of weed and the sink clogged every time it was used.
This isn't your Grandpa's Flamingo anymore. I would even venture to say this isn't your overweight Chain smoking uncle Larry's Flamingo we all knew and didn't love from 5-10 years ago!. . Before My recent trip to The Flamingo, the thought of staying there would immediately trigger thoughts of Depressing 1980's decor, overweight fanny pack wearing gamblers & The over exuberant expressions of Donnie & Marie as they stared longingly into each others eyes trying to forget about that one night back in 77' when things went a little to far. But to the contrary I must say the Flamingo has really cleaned up its act. The new decor is nice and the casino floor is clean and 80% fanny pack clear. . . Now saying that I have yet to stay in a room, but I will say that , where as before I would've only taken a side chick I was slightly ashamed of. Now I would be ok with taking a side chick I was not ashamed of, as well as possibly a girl that I have been dating awhile, all the while  insisting "Why do we have to put labels on what we are" here without hesitation!. . All in all The Flamingo is an OK place with a GREAT location that I would recommend anyone walking the strip to try out. Hey, who knows you may finally be the first person to see Donnie and Marie finally consummate 35 years of tension and frustration!
I wanted a perfect diva on a budget place to stay for my birthday weekend and once I saw a picture of Flamingo's new black & pink rooms, I knew this was it.. . This was one of the cheapest places we could find and the location is PERFECT center strip.. . The outdoor pool area isn't super fancy but it's nice and wasn't insanely crowded.. . The rooms are average size but very classy with pink & black decor and black hardwood floors. It was a really fun place to hang out.. . I would definitely stay here again!
We def had to wait in line a good while to check in.  The line wrapped around the lobby at least three times. . . I read reviews about TVs in the bathroom mirror...but we did not have that. The room was pretty basic and it was supposed to be a deluxe king (we had two queens instead). . . The pillows feel short and kept slipping off the bed. The closet and bathroom were small but adequate. My room was $56 on week nights and over $100 on weekends. The resort fee was $25 for one day...which was nearly half of the room cost. . . They were working on the casino so whole sections had machines pulled out And caution tape roping it off. We spent all of our time in nicer casinos like Paris, Caesars, and others.
What a dump.  (Compared to all other hotel / casinos).  Don't let the pics fool you.  The old 70's casino tables and the mold in the bathrooms was enough for me.  Time for an extreme makeover..
Stayed at the Flamingo for my bachelorette. Prime location, decent rooms. We checked in late Friday afternoon so there was a line but it moved fast and staff were very attentive and sweet. Dennis was the sweetest guy ever, he checked us in and made sure we knew the best spots in town and gave us the fastest route to our room. Highly recommend!
Overall 2.5 stars. . Pool 4 stars best part of the resort is the outside grounds and pools.. . You have to upgrade to a "go" room or else they put you in a room from 1975.  It was disgusting.  The go room wasn't amazing either, but clean.. . The hotel is nothing great, except for pool.
I love the area with all the animals! This a must-see when in Vegas. I love the koi and the flamingos. Just beautiful! It is great to see a hotel that has their namesake!
I love wildlife, fountains, greenery, and the color pink, so naturally I was charmed by this place when we found it by chance as we explored The Strip. The buffet is affordable, about 20 per person, and it has everything-- seafood, California rolls, American dishes, fruit, desserts, and all kinds of delicious items. The Wildlife Habitat right by the restaurant was enchanting. I saw flamingos (obviously), ducks, and even a BLACK swan swimming along with the bright-colored fishes. A true delight for the transcendentalist soul and photographers alike. I'd definitely consider staying here in the future.
This place is old and worn out. It reeks of cigarette smoke. If you check in at 4:30 pm, expect to stand in line for 2 hours. They also did something that really made me mad. Without disclosing to me at the time of booking or discussing with me at the time of check-in, I discovered when I got home and looked at the receipt they emailed me that they added a so-called "Resort Fee" of $22.40 per night to the bill. I have no idea what that was for and I am challenging it. This was my 4th time in Vegas. The other places I stayed at were the Excaliber, San Remo (now Hooter's) and MGM Grand. All prior experiences were fine/no issues.
Let me first preface this review by saying A-this was our first visit to Las Vegas and #2 we are not picky people at all, so that being said, I need to first apologize to the all the yelpers that posted a negative review of this place...I wrote you off as being super  picky complainers...for that I am sorry...I went, I saw..now I believe...everyone that posted a negative review was 100% right!!!. . So on to my experinces.... . 1) Check in was a nightmare, there was a super long line, a couple of flustered peope behind the check out desk...but as I waited I drank...then drank some more...thank GOD for booze and I was feeling no pain after the almost 1.5 hours it took to get through the line and check in.. . 2) Got to our room, seemed nice enough although not too clean...oh well..I'm not picky..I'll deal with it.  Wanted to take a shower after the flight and long check in prior to our dinner reservations, did not check for towels first, never had too before in any other hotel I stayed at, got into the shower and waited for hot water...waited for warm water, gave up and waited for luke warm water...semi tepid water...anything....water continued to be freezing cold after 25 mins of running it.. . I got out of the cold shower and noticed that there were no towels...like not even one...just a wash cloth.  Now I'm not a small girl...no way that wa going to cut it.  Had to get dressed while still totally wet.. . Dripping wet and cold I was still in a fairly jovial mood..I was in Vegas after all! nothing was going to get me down!!  Unfortunately that all changed when I attempted to speak to someone about the cold water.. I spoke with Teresa who was supposed to be a manager, she was snippy and overtly rude and decidely uncaring about the situation.  Took me three more phone calls to get them to deal with the problem.. . Waited 20 mins, housekeeping finally arrived with towels-they seemed surprised that we would think that towels came with the room (?). Waited for the maintenance person who ran the water for another 20mins and then declared that no hot water was to be had in this room.. . We called the front desk again, they were very rude, told us that we would either need to move to the smoking room on the top floor or the wheelchair accessible room.  We choose that top floor as they said that it was an upgrade.. . I was mad that we would have to give up the King room we booked for a double queen....but beyond that they made the whole prcess of changing rooms such a pain, my good mood was gone at this point!!. . We were escorted by security to get our things, then back down to the front desk to collect our new room key...it was nuts and totally unessessary.  They were unapologietic about the whole matter...we just wanted our room!!. . 3) We got to the new room and immediately I noticed that it had not been cleaned in some time, the light switches were flithy, the hair dryer did not work, there was a panty liner behind the bed (gross) along with an assortment of water bottle caps and huge dust bunnies.  The view was good as it was of the wheel, however there was not much else about the room that was positive.. . And once again there were no towels!!!!. . I set off on a mission to find a cleaner and more importantly a cleaning cart with supplies.  I spoke to the maid on the floor and explained what I found in our room, shesimply shrugged her shoulders and said that I could call the front desk.  Noting my terrible experience with them already, I decided to not call and take matters into my own hands.  I proceeded to help myslef to the fresh towels on the cart, and some cleaning supplies....YES ladies and gentlemen...I cleaned our friggin' room!!!!!  And let me say that I do take some pride in saying that I did a phemonimal job of it!!!!  They should hire me to train their housekeeping staff.. . 4) We got up early the next day and did not return to our room until almost 6:30pm to shower and change for our evening out.....I could not believe it...no housekeeping staff had bothered to turn up!!!  no clean towels for our showers (we left the days previous towles in the bathtub as is customary to request fresh towels) Needless to say I set out on a mission again to find a cleaning cart.  Thankfully I found someone at teh end of the hall, I advised them that our room had not been cleaned...no fresh towels...and you guessed it...she didn't care.. I took some towels off her cart, enough for the next two days...and stomped off.. . 5) told the manager later at the front desk-someone named Josh-he apologized and comped us a free breakfast-thanks but doesnt make up for all the work cleaning I did...lol. . 6) Be ready to be totally harrassed by a ton of people posing to be Flamigo hotel staff wanting to give you a "free gift" they are trying to sell time shares and sign you up for a 2+ hour presentation-THEY WILL NOT LEAVE YOU ALONE THE ENTIRE TIME AND ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE EVEN WHEN TOLD NO!
When gangster Bugsy Siegel opened The Flamingo in 1946 he envisioned a hotel with luxurious rooms, the best liquor and restaurants, a spa, and top rate entertainment at reasonable prices in the best building that money could buy. If Siegel could see what this hotel has degraded to he would probably beg you to shoot him in the face again. Thank god we only had to stay here for one night.. . Imagine a Super 8 or Motel 6 stacked twenty-eight times high with Donny and Marie's faces spray-painted on it. Now put the slowest elevators in the history of vertical transport inside the building and you'll start to get a clear picture of what this hotel is like. By slow, I mean it takes forever for an elevator to arrive. If I wasn't on the tenth floor I would have taken the stairs every time.. . The current incarnation of The Flamingo isn't 70 years old but if you saw the interior of our room you would think it was. If someone had told me that the building hadn't been renovated in decades I would have believed it. The vanity in the bathroom looked as though someone had scraped a wood planer across the front of it. The paint was also peeling off the bathroom ceiling and a floor tile was loose. The room had no fridge or microwave either. The best part of the whole experience was the lack of free wifi in the hotel. We walked through every major hotel and resort on the strip and every single one offers free wifi. The only way you get wifi for free here is if you pay a $25 resort fee. So it's not really free is it?. . The check-in process was a long, frustrating cattle call. It was like waiting to get on a ride at Disneyland. After spending 20 minutes in line we were "greeted" by a rude, abrupt, and indifferent clerk. She seemed like she was just "putting in her obligatory time" at the desk in hopes of getting an executive position.. . There was no 'Do Not Disturb' sign in the room so needless to say, housekeeping tried to enter the next morning. I don't know why they tried to come in at half-past ten because check-out is at 11:00. Why doesn't the housekeeping staff wait until you've checked out? It just seemed like they were trying to get us out of there sooner.. . This place is a dump. The Flamingo is riding on the coat tails of its former glory. Every other major hotel on the strip has it beat with superior amenities and service. We should have stayed in one of those. Lesson learned for next time.. . The only professional service we got was from the bell desk staff when we checked our bags. Totally personable, prompt, and laid back.. . Conrad Hilton and Bugsy Siegel are probably groaning in their graves with embarrassment over this place.
Pros: . - Right in themiddle of the strip.. - Access to the monorail within the hotel.. - The Fab Deluxe was clean and the beds were soft.. - Cheapest Price in the Middle of the strip.. - Rooms are well kept.. - Margarita Ville. . Cons:. - Cellphone Reception in the rooms. (No signal in any of the rooms. Casino OK). - No Free Wifi for Suite Rooms. Wifi is bad and slow.. - Buffet is weak and did not have much. (AVOID). - No good channels. (1) kids channel.. - Room Service Ends at 9pm (Way too early) and starts at 6am.. . My review based on the Fab Deluxe Room.. . I stayed here on a Saturday and Sunday. Got here around 12pm and checked in early ($20 Fee). I ordered an extra bed ($60) and was given a room key and went into my room. The hallway seems a but rundown and the cieling is VERY low! (Anyone over 6" may have to duck a bit!) The room was well kept and very clean. (Exactly Like their Online Picture!). The TV was a small flat Screen with no good channels and 1 kids channel. Mostly they're advertisements. The bathroom was ok. Its a cookie cutter bathroom. (Same design as the rest of the Hotels). Beds are soft and comfortable and the pillows were fluffy!. . Room Service stops at 9pm and starts at 6am which is dissapointing compared to the 24 Hour Room Service at Hooters. . . Cellphone reception is TERRIBLE in the rooms! Using a Verizon Wireless Phone I could barely keep 4G (1 bar) in my room! Sometimes the signal drops all together. Inside the Casino its fine.. . Wifi is $12 for ONE DEVICE. The connection is slow and just logging in was a pain. Pass on the wifi.. . Their Buffet is terrible! (We had brunch) The selection was insulting to buffets. There were about 12 selections for food (Sausage, Hashbrowns, Bacon, Eggs Benedict) but over 25 selections for Salad toppings!!!! They did have a choclate fountain but it was not worth the $20 admission! Make a pass on this buffet.. . The Casino is the same as the rest.. . The flamingo has a Monorail station down the hall for easy access to all the strip and I highly recommend getting a pass when heading home as it will save you walking (Especially if youre at the edges of the strip!). . Did not experience the pool because it was winter and I did not experience the Flamingo Garden walkway. . . Overall:. . 4/5. . Great Location, Price, Monorail Stop location and Rooms...but terrible cellphone signal, wifi, and room service.
I don't get what all the negative reviews are about. Sure, the Flamingo isn't the most luxurious hotel in Vegas, but that's pretty clear upfront. You cannot beat the location and the restaurants/food court on the property have something for everyone. Our room was clean, had a decent view and we rarely had to wait for an elevator. . . A couple complaints: we paid a hefty resort fee and the pool was closed. We were able to use Paris' free of charge, but we were disappointed because we had heard Rave reviews of the Flamingo pool.. . We also received a noise complaint from hotel security at 1:30 am on a Friday night in Vegas. Lighten up people.. . Bottom line: If you're looking for a centrally located hotel on the Strip for a good price, the Flamingo is your place. Check in online for more speedy service upon arrival.
What is going on Flamingo? This has been our go to place several times a year for the past 5 years. Great location but the service has gone downhill!  Wed. before Thanksgiving, 1400 guests expected, yet only 3 people checking folks in. Line for keys was even longer!! Took longer than usual to get our baggage, got to room and keys not working. Stay tuned for room rating...
At Flamingo, the only thing they have going for it is the central location on the strip.  Am glad we only spent one night here because the Hilton Grand Vacation Flamingo wasn't available on the Friday evening.  I booked Flamingo using AirMiles and this may have influenced the room we got.  When I booked, I requested an early check in and a non smoking room.. . The night before we checked in, I went to ask about the early check in.  I was told that early check in would result in a charge of $20-30 (I can't recall the exact amounts) depending if we wanted to check in before or after 12PM.  It wasn't worth paying extra so we went to check in at 4:30PM after their 4PM time.  Be prepared to line up.  The estimated time was about half an hour but at least they offered small bottled water.. . We checked in and waited by the elevators.  The elevators are sloooooow and not just during check in (Waited at least 5 minutes at 10PM and 9AM).  There are 2 sets of elevators, with the one set saying it will go down only (there are 4 elevators and they are used by staff but they are faster than the other ones so I recommend going down from your room using these ones).  Some of the elevators like to rock and roll but don't worry, this seems to be normal.. . Our room, 10062, was the first one at the end of the hallway.  I wasn't sure how noisy it would be but luckily it wasn't too bad.  Being spoiled by HGV stay, we didn't appreciate there was no mini fridge, no free wifi anywhere in the hotel/casino, and an old room.  The bathoom vanity has paint peeling off, dresser and desk had knicks, and grout in bathtub.  I wasn't sure if we paid the resort fee as we did have to pay fee and taxes booking using AirMiles so I called to ask but we didn't.  I think the fee is only for wifi for one device/room which doesn't make sense.  . . The worst issue was the loud hum when it was time to sleep.  It sounded like an engine and luckily I was able to fall asleep with this noise.  When I woke up, there was no hum.  We didn't want to bother lining up again to check out so we did so via the TV system for self check out.. . Yes, the hotel room is only to sleep in but when I'm on vacation, I want to be comfortable and well rested.  Makes it difficult to do that when they don't offer the amenities to enjoy the stay.  I noticed the receipt of people in front of us at the bag drop off and couldn't believe they paid more than $170 Canadian to stay in this hotel.  With so many other hotels nearby, I would never stay here again.
Worst hotel experience ever, do not come here during thanksgiving, the check in wait can be anywhere from 2-5hours. 15 check in counters with only 3 people doing check in. No care for customers and the worst customer retention strategy ever!
it sucks. You have to wait at least 2 hours at midnight on thanksgiving vacation. They don't give their customer a shit
4 hour wait just to check in.  When I book a hotel, I expect to be able to sleep there, but they've kept everyone waiting past 4am.  Ridiculous.
Updated room.. liked the tv in the bathroom.  Had a good time.
Not a bad hotel, but it's not the great place some people rave about. You get what you pay for $40/Night.. . On the positive-great location, in the middle of everything. It is the most centrally located hotel in the stip.I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the staff members were--I was bracing myself for battle after reading other people's reviews. Good food at Carlos and Charlies. If you want a midnight snack, the food court is good, decent; however, it is a little expensive. . . Negative-the bathrooms in the guest rooms do need some serious work-rust and mold all over the shower area. It appears very insanitary. I have to request my room to be serviced, refreshed two consecutive days by mid evening--housekeeping seems to be unreliable. Paper thin walls-get prepared to listen to everything from your neighbor's room--no joke on this one. I am not sure if I would pay for the buffet; I am glad we got free passes from the conference organizer.
I love staying at the Flamingo, but this last visit was less than satisfactory. Room 11050 needs some attention. The bed was horrific! 2 nights on that bed, and I'm experiencing back pain n aches! The bathroom is super small with a little round mirror in the bathroom... Hard for 2 people to get ready at the same time.  I love the updated decor, but decor isn't comfortable... Update your beds at the very least!
Dont ever go there gamble.. . I go there for blackjack on my 21st birthday on Nov 26,2014, 11:30pm. . The manager looks fucking upset and ask me do not win anymore.... for three times... every time he pass by. .  WTFi leave immediately. . . Fuck you.   If you cant lose, close the casino or quit your risk job. . . Never go back again.
If you are going to Vegas and not looking to impress anyone then the Flamingo is your place. The check in was easy and the room we had was average but clean. The Flamingo is easy to get around and the location is great. After a night of drinking the food court was decent but what food isn't bad when you are drunk. In closing I would stay at the Flamingo again for the price and location. No thrills but had a good weekend there.
Yeah it's close to everything but the rooms aresuper dirty. I would never sleep in this hotel again.
You can't beat the location and price of the Flamingo.  It's right on the new LINQ promenade, which is full of great restaurants, bars, and shops.  In addition, there's the amazing High Roller observation wheel.  We stayed in a FAB room, which had a nicely renovated main room.  However, the bathrooms needed a little "love" -- rusted door hinges, slight water damage to the door, and peeling paint.  Service checking in and out was very straightforward and friendly.  Overall, very pleased with my stay!. . Tip: If you arrive early but want to avoid the early check-in fee and long lines at 4pm - start the check in process and check your bags at the bell desk.  Definitely make it clear that you are NOT fully checking in and that you will get your keys at 4pm.  Double check that the charge is not applied.  Come back at 4pm and go straight to the "keys & mail" line.  You can then pick up your keys, call the bell desk from your room and have them sent directly to you!
Never thought we need to pay to print boarding passes here been in most of the hotel elsewhere where the printing service is free.  hotel room looks ok. Newly renovated but the bathroom needs a major upgrade. price is very resonable for what your going to get so dont expect to much. I would recomend the hotel if your traveling in a budget. And not looking for much. Front desk staff looks very serious and are not very welcoming. Except for brian who checks us in Very sencere and polite. Over all my experience with the hotel was ok.
