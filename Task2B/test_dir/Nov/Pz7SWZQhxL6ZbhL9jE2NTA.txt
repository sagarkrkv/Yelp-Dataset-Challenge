FRIGGIN HOT. No, not talking about the vibe of this place. As in literally. It must have been at least 80s in this boiler room! . . I can't taste my drink, what is this??. Oh sorry, the large ball of ice in your drink melted by the time I walked over.... Oh.... . So for the view, sure, that was cool. You're high up on the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay and get to see Vegas stretch out before you. And I guess if you were looking for a sauna with a great view at night, you found it? But as a lounge...I'm not sure, unless they get some AC that works, because I wasn't enjoying my "lounging" experience while sweating up a storm.... . If you're looking to dance and let loose, not the ideal place either. They have a small dance area in front of the DJ that's right at the entrance. Good for smaller parties? Meh..
I've only been to the lounge portion of MIX, so I can't comment on their food.  What I can comment on is the great view of The Strip and not unreasonable drink pricing.  This is a cool spot to hang out, grab a table, and enjoy a live DJ without having to get dressed up or wait in line.. . Drinks were on the cheap side for a Strip property, with bottled beers (the likes of Dogfish Head and Goose Island) only $9, with domestics coming in even cheaper.  The view is nice, but it's not directly along Las Vegas Boulevard; it's still worth coming here to see at least once.
Last week, we had our wedding dinner/reception up at Mix and it was perfect!!  (Yes, it deserves a double exclamation mark) We wanted to go to a restaurant with an amazing view and a combination of steaks and seafood.  Mix definitely delivered.  Our long table was right outside overlooking the lit up Vegas strip.  It was phenomenal!  Randy, our server went above & beyond to make our wedding night amazing with great service, jokes and a speech about love and marriage.  We weren't surprised at all when the food came out and everyone zoned out in the love of their meal.  They made us a TREMENDOUS cake for the celebration which was amazing to get pictures with in front of the skyline. . . Thank you again Mix.  We'll definitely take you up on coming back every year for our anniversary!. . Cheers!
Food is very good, and the view is outrageous. They run late night specials and there is no better way to end a night (over 50 crowd) or start a night (under 30 crowd). All will be happy here. You can even sit outside, high above the noise of the casino floors, under the warmth of a heater and just smile.
Very cool lounge to relax and converse with friends, or also bring a date.  They usually have a great music with a superb view from Mandalay Rooftop overlooking the North strip.  I believe you might even be able to order food as well.  If you have been to foundation it is pretty similar except the outside area is better and there is a restaurant next door as well.
I stayed at the Delano, so naturally I had to check out MIX. We sat in the lounge part. We got there about 8 and around 830 there was no seats left so I would get there early! The Mai Tai was pretty big and strong. I wish I would have been in Vegas longer, I would totally love to eat at the restaurant part- it was beautiful. Definitely recommended, even if the drinks a $16 a pop!
Beautiful view. . Customer service is awful!!!!! Definitely understaffed. If there were more bartenders on staff I might consider giving it another shot. I just can't see waiting 45 minutes for one drink!
Incredible ambience. Perfect service, if not a bit too attentive. So much to look at! But the meals are so unique & delicious. Get something from every course.
Terrific view..good service..WEAK drink... . The view is awesome..really good..the seating is excellent. .music rins hot and cold..but great all together
This place is awesome!  Great service, beautiful view and outrageously yummy food. Came here in a group of 13  and we all ordered different things on the menu to share.  Everything was excellent.  My favorites were all the steaks and scallops. Cooked perfectly.  Will definitely come back next time we're in Vegas!. . Other memorable things: reasonable prices for fine dining and try out the views from the bathroom stalls
I've been to MIX a few times now. There are a few different sections to MIX so I'll break it down.. . The restaurant:. They use to have a Restaurant.com deal so it helped with the steep pricing. The food is pretty good but not memorable.. . The lounge/club:. This is not your traditional night club. There is a dinning section, the bar, the outdoors lounge (with a bottle service option of course). There is a DJ but the music is...mixed. I'm not quite sure what genre or timeframe it's from. Not many people dance and the patrons are generally a bit older than the trendy night clubs in town. The bar is a mess. They make some of the drinks "in the back"...I put it in quotes because I don't know why the have to go to the back. I see the alcohol, I see the juices...mmm whatever. Like most nightclubs in Las Vegas, the bartenders are swamped and pressured to turn out drinks quickly. I feel for them on that front. But you don't have to have rude to me when I've patiently waited to be served unlike some other people that push and shove and throw money on the bar. Don't huff and puff at me and stomp around. For this reason, I'm not coming back.. . Overall:. +Great view of the strip from here. You can't see as much from the dining room but the lounge is great. Also check out the lounge's restroom! You're in for a surprise!. -There's obviously no cover to get into the lounge from the restaurant but there generally is a cover after 9 or 10pm. There are often people in the lobby passing out discount entry passes but if you stop by the Mlife desk, they might give you complimentary passes. It's not worth it if you're paying to go up to see the view.. +/-No dress code (nothing enforced, but lots preferred)
Love this restaurant....great food! The view is the best in Vegas, by far. The ambiance is wonderful and that chandelier is to die for. I have eaten here 3 times now and every time has been memorable. Lounge is a bit dated, but still enjoy the place.
Mix Ultra Lounge and Restaurant are the best combination of food and entertainment on the strip~!!  The views from the bar and restaurant are amazing and the food is so delicious~!!  I've been coming here for years and only wished I lived in town so I could go there every week~!   The bar Manager Sebastian always takes good care of us.  Our server Charles has waited on us a handful of time and always delivers super service.  On the lounge side is where you can dance off dinner and replace with awesome cocktails.  I would like to thank Joe, Christopher and Brian for always making our trips to Mix memorable and fun ~!!  I like the DJ and dance floor~!  Me and my wife will be coming back soon ~!!
