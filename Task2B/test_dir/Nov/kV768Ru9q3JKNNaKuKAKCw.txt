Phenomenal show! So enchanting and breathtaking! I didn't know circ had shows with water involved but it was very entertaining. $130 were cheaper tickets with taxes and fees. Totally worth it, I would certainly recommend it and even would go again.  You get what you pay for and more!
This is a great show! I had the opportunity of watching the show twice within the past 4 months, which is awesome! I really enjoyed the show the first time I watched it. It was amazing and I was mesmerized. There were technically difficulties that day, so I missed the last 10 min of the show. They did a separate ending, and I wondered if there was something else that was suppose to be there.  I was mesmerized throughout the entire show. . . The second time I saw the show, it wasn't as amazing since I already knew everything that was going to happen. . . I am the type of person that does not like the clown bits in the show. I do not think they're funny, and I dislike them! I get that they're for comic relief, and scene changes, but still! . . All in all, it truly is a mesmerizing show, and I am amazed at all the amazing cool acrobatic tricks that these people do.
Because this is a Cirque du Soleil show I just CANNOT give it less than four stars because I am a diehard fan. There are things I loved about this show and things I was incredibly disappointed in. . Loved:. 1) impressive stage and amazing technology. 2) the backbending acrobats. 3) the swimmers and divers. 4) the costumery. 5) the innovative imagery. . Disappointed:. 1) Total absence of storyline. Listen, I know what you're thinking: I just didn't "get it." I ASSURE you there was NOTHING to get. This is my third soleil show that I've seen and the storylines in the other two shows were deep, complex, emotional and full of substance and interpretive messages. This show had practically nothing to analyze or think about. It requires absolutely no intellectual depth. This is a HUGE disappointment. 2) good god with the choreographed splashing. I mean seriously. It was awkward, repetitive and completely NOT artfully executed.. 3) absence of non-harnessed aerial performers. I do aerial silk classes as a hobby and I so look forward to watching a professional performance of this and there was NONE. Essentially every aerialist was harnessed and controlled with technological movement. Now I'm not saying that makes the strength and talent less impressive, but certainly there should be SOME amount of pure technology-free performing going on. I would like to focus on the talents of the performers not the pulleys and wires.. 4) the price. This is the most expensive Cirque du Soleil show I've seen. And it is also my least favorite. FYI- you can see practically the entire show on Netflix in the Worlds Away movie. True story. . . Honestly, I wanted to like this so much more than I did. But having said that, I mean it is a moving piece of art. It has some imagery that is unforgettable. It is not a waste of money to see but it really could benefit from a subtle but consistent storyline. . . The art of Richard MacDonald in the Bellagio outside the O Theatre is a MUST-SEE. Even if u skip the show. This exhibit is just glorious and should not be missed by anyone with even a minimal appreciation for visual art.
** O is a breathtaking show that utilizes a stage that magically fills up with water. The circus acts were elegant, albeit a tad boring. Ticket prices are high. **. . My 6th Cirque Du Soleil show! . . I haven't written a review in over a month. Please excuse my lackadaisicalbehavior, Yelpers and Yelpettes, I can no longer ingest anything fried, salty, meaty, carby or sweet. Says who? My bladder. . . So what's the point of living? Well... I've been asking myself that too. It's been tough kids, especially since I can't eat at yummy places. No yummy places,  means I can't write Yelp reviews. No reviews means I'm Yelpless! Ohhh... the depravity. Life in a first world country is so hard. #firstworldproblems. . So... what were we talking about? Oh yes, my bladder... no wait... O. No, not that O, the show O, silly! Well kids, I can still watch shows so I'm content to just writing about shows and sex stores that I visit. O was interesting, in a blah sort of way. I think I'm officially Cirque-d out (did I just make up a word)? I've watched so many, they are getting repetitive. . . Here's the adjectives I'd use to describe O: beautiful, expensive, BORING, tasteful, watery, SNOOZE. Get the idea? Being my 6th Cirque show, I've already seen a version of all the acts in other shows. There's nothing new and nothing mesmerizing. The stage and the use of water is breathtaking... for about 5 mins... then it's like, "cool." You know what it reminds me of? The fountain show at Bellagio. It's cool the first two times you watch it, maybe a third time it holds some fascination. But for an hour and twenty minutes? No thanks. . . The stage and the acts are very beautiful, similar to a well choreographed ballet. Unfortunately I find ballet boring. My favorite act were the contortionists. Three beautiful ladies contort themselves into different poses. They seem to defy gravity.. . Side note: this was the first Cirque show I fell asleep in. I even stayed awake during Beatles Love. If you've read my review, that's saying a lot.
This Show is located in the Bellagio Hotel. . . It's located kinda to the right but if you follow the signs it's easy to find.. . When you walk up you can buy tickets right there or pickup tickets at will call or just have them with you already and walk right in.. . We bought seat in section 103 row E12 & E13 which did dead center in the middle of the room about 5 rows from the stage. The tickets were about $170.00 each but it's definitely worth the money. . . The show starts out with a funny clown getting everyone to clap at all different weird times. It was funny. They also pretended to grab random people from the audiance to do they stunts but really they were apart of the show. They are sneaky.. . They do some insane dives in the water and cool acrobatic moves. I don't want to ruin it for the people that haven't seen it yet but it's worth doing with the kids or the wife. We had such an awesome time. This was our first show together and we loved it.
3rd favorite Cirque show on The Strip. A little bit hard to follow, but beautiful to watch. Outstanding diving!
What a show! I'd never seen a Cirque du Soleil show and this was the one I wanted to see!. . We stayed at the Hotel which made seeing a 10 PM show on a Saturday evening pretty easy. . . The theatre is beautiful, well designed for the show. We sat on the far side in a section with slightly less expensive seats. The theatre was less than half full...though there were quite a few people right around us.. . As soon as the show started and the lights went down, most of those around us got up and moved to better seats. It was strange, it was like everyone knew the trick...everyone but us!. . The show is very good, entertaining, dazzling, some moves took your breath away. The storyline was...hard to follow. Okay, I wish I'd had more to drink or something, maybe it would have made more sense. . . But in the end, it didn't matter. It was an awesome show that stretched the boundaries of what we thought was possible with every scene.
Oh Wow is all I can say.. This show has amazing performers. They are just outstanding. There were multiple times where they just blew my mind.. Visually the show was stunning and music was engaging It just left my mouth agape.. This is must see show my only gripe is that I did not get the plot but honestly I did not care.. GOGOGO
It was an okay show. I've seen a lot better shows from Cirque than this one. I really was expecting a lot better show than what I got at O.
Second Cirque du Soleil show I've attended and had a great time. I came to see this show with my parents, sister, and a huge group of family friends who were visiting from Taiwan. Everyone was completely entranced by the breathtaking sets, the incredible feats, and hilarious transition acts. Compared to the first show I attended (Totem), O seemed to have more fun and lighthearted acts, such as the pool party act. There is not much of a plot but whatevs.. . We had tickets for a side/middle section (tickets about $110 or$120 each?) and the view was great. Perfectly eye-level with the sets, which were often up in the air, so that we didn't have to crane our necks. Also, we were near the back enough so that we could easily get a view of the entire stage. . . A tip:. - Get here early to pick up your tickets! Otherwise there will be a long time and it will not be fun.
An amazing out of this world show.... Process to get it..out..ticketing. .all of it... . Must see....best seats..row 3 to 10..worth rhe money..do not you dare try to save 20 or 30 dollars you cheap bas...ds...this is not where you save money on vegas..skip a meal and take the ticket... The meal..eventually goes down the toilet.. The memory..for ever... . Why four stars...well..no one is perfect
I'm not a big Cirque du Soleil guy, but this show was fantastic.  I've been to 1 other Cirque show, and I did not find it very enjoyable.  I usually like shows with a more involved story line and music.  For "O," everything from the music, to the staging, to the performance, to the story was great.  We had pretty good seats, and I was amazed how the stage was able to change so quickly.. . I have not seen the other Cirque shows in Vegas, but I can't imagine they are any better than O.  If you have the opportunity, go see it.  You will not regret it!
Breathtaking! This was our first Cirque show and it definitely won't be the last. I wasn't sure what to expect, but knew I wanted to go to Cirque show while in town. Amazing show, with too much to see. I am looking forward to going again to soak in everything I may have missed the first time around. . . Dazzled by the artists and their ability to move so gracefully whether high above the ground or throughout the water. We did not have any issues with people being ushered in late as with some other posters. We sat in the lower section, row k, just left of the stage. I do not believe there is a bad seat in the house.
This is only the second Cirque du Soleil I have seen, the first one being Beatles Love, and O was amazing! Not saying Beatles Love wasn't good, but I can see why O is raved as the best one! I probably should've watched a few other ones before this one. All future shows are ruined!. . We watched the 7:30pm show on Thanksgiving Day. 4 seats in section 104 was about $180 each. You should pick up your tickets at will call a few hours before or else the line gets really long. The doors open around 7pm and there's alcohol on the right and a regular concession stand on the left. . . The show itself was magnificent! Some of the aerobics and tricks almost gave me a heart attack. I can't believe how talented the performers are! The way the stage is setup is amazing! The only con for me was the show felt a little short. No intermission and no grand finale but I guess it's their choice. It ended around 9:10pm. The time flew by, I wish the show was longer! Also, I'm sure the story line was great, but I honestly couldn't follow it at all haha
This finally concludes one of the last shows I have never seen in Vegas, as well one of the only Cirque du Soleil shows I haven't seen yet.. . I can't find a way to give it 5 stars simply because their proliferate use of "actor" audience members got really tiring after a while, but I have to say I am extremely impressed by the stage, the show, their entrances and exits and their visual appeal.. . The only thing I disliked was that there was a huge lack of storyline. I mean I think they tried but it seemed like they had a small box and tried to cram too much into it. It just didn't work.. . Visually, this show is absolutely stunning. There's nothing short of breathtaking from their acts to their various themes and multiple stage changes throughout the show. I don't know if this show is worth the high price tag that you pay to see it if you're interested in a story line and something coherent to grab onto but it's definitely Vegas entertainment at it's very best. . . I would say this is a must see show for Vegas, so if you haven't seen it, pay up because it is worth seeing at least once.
You know, having never been to a Cirque du Soleil performance before, I was really skeptical about dishing out close to two hunnerd clams to see a bunch of Canadians prancing about in tights.  There was bound to be mincing.  And someone mentioned clowns.  Oh boy.  But, on the recommendation of a whole lot of people, I bought us some tickets to take a gander.. . Holy crap -- this was an amazing performance.  From the startling open reveal to the equally stunning closing bit, I enjoyed every minute.. . Even the clowns.. . It's quite impressive to see the physical acts that the human body is capable of.  Trapezes, high dives, contortionists, guys on fire -- it's all there somewhere.. . We sat kind of near the back and still had a good view of the stage -- I don't think there's a bad seat in the house -- but it would be REALLY cool to be up close in the middle of the front sections.  So buy your tickets as early as possible.
