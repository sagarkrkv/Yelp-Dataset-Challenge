This was my first Cirque Du Soleil show ever, and I was not disappointed. I sat in the first row of the upper level, and the seats were great. . . This show told a story about two siblings who were separated at a young age and went on to live different lives. Eventually they meet again. Of course there's more to the story, but I can't spoil it for you! . . The performers were great. Sooo athletic and every movement was perfection. Some of them even came out before the show started and scared some audience members (myself included). . . I love how the whole arena was their stage. It made it more interesting and kept the audience on the edge of their seat. . . Even the ushers helping people find their seats were in costume and in character. I think Cirque hired all comedians to be the ushers, because they were all hilarious! . . Make sure you get here early to find your seats, and don't miss any of the action. KA was the highlight of my trip.
This was the very first Cirque du Soleil show that I have seen. I'm writing a review based upon when I saw the show SEVERAL years ago. (From what I have heard they have recently made a lot of changes; changes that were not for the good).. . When I saw the show it was amazing. The acrobatics and fights were amazing. It also had a great story line that was easy to follow.
2nd favorite Cirque show on The Strip. Be sure to sit further back - lots going on above your seats. The moving floor/wall is amazing.
Ok I was super excited to go see this show because I've seen 3 cirque shows before and I was super impressed with them. This one, not so much. My hubby and I were very disappointed. Scenes were long, and drug out. Very boring. If u want to see a great cirque show, go see mystire!! I was BLOWN AWAY BY MYSTIRE! I really hate to give a low review but it's really not worth the money..
I did not know about the accident prior to seeing the show, so when the performance ended, my entire party and I left feeling confused at the abrupt conclusion.  Perhaps it was also due to the fact we were at the 7pm showing and there was another one at 9pm, which does not leave much time for preparations. . . The last battle consisted of a vertical wall and was indeed a projection.  While still impressive, I felt that for the price we paid, everything should have been live.  The safety of the performers should always be a priority, but to maintain the value of the show, a live alternate ending should be put in place.  . . It is still a great show, but had I known about the fatal accident with the vertical wall, I probably wouldn't have felt so disappointed.
I first saw the show 3 years ago, and I absolutely loved it. It was so amazing! I saw the show again last night, and I just thought it was okay. It could possibly be because I had better seats the first time. It could also be that Ka was the first show I saw, and since then I have seen many other cirque shows. I really loved the  O Show, and I was mesmerized. . . When I saw Ka, it kind of bored me. The stage was amazing and stunning. They use multiple different stages and it's so cool how they move everything.. . It is a story of 2 twins who get lost and it's their journey to finding each other. While on their journey, they run into love and battle and evil. They do have cool tricks and do amazing things. . . I prefer the O show because it's spectacular, and I loved the music in Zarkana and I loved the old school circus theme.  So, while this show is still amazing, it's no longer my favorite.
You really can never go wrong with cirque du soleil. This particular show is an acrobatic/ martial arts fusion. It's a pretty amazing show. You are taken on a journey of two royal siblings trying to reunite after a sudden attack on their family. You see what they go through and how they grow. It's another beautiful story. I highly recommend it! ( also you'll have a easier time finding discounted tickets on this show rather than one of the more popular cirque du soleil shows.)
A visual spectacle. We sat in the second row. It was great to see all the makeup and such close up, but I recommend sitting towards the middle for the most epic experience. This show has great lighting, dazzling effects but was light on the showy acrobatics. It offset that omission with an interesting story and set design unlike anything you have ever seen.. . Just two things: some of the instrumental score is underwhelming, generic and loud.. . And it's about 20 minutes too long.
My favorite of all the Cirque shows on the strip! The spectacle of "O" is amazing, but the storyline, music and automated stages are what makes this one the ultimate show to see in Las Vegas. Especially now that the original battle finale has been restored; this show shouldn't be missed!
Really amazing, it was my first Cirque de Soleil show and I thought it was awesome. The martial arts and stage effects where really amazing. And I cant want to see other Cirque shows to compare.. . We had really good seats and I think that really added to the experience,  make sure you book through tix4tonight or mlife to get a discount.
