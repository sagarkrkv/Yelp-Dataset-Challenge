This is easily one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas. You can get a delicious steak experience without having to pay super premium steakhouse prices. . I love the filet with the red wine reduction. My brother loves the filet with bernaise. My parents love the french onion soup. The fish was just okay, but go with the steak and you will be a happy camper. The thin cut fries are also rave worthy, especially once they get lathered in that great red wine sauce. Yum. They are crispy though before the lathering, don't worry.. For dessert, the chocolate mouse is excellent, with little chocolate crisps thrown in for texture. However, my favorite is their profiteroles. I believe their vanilla ice cream is home made, and if it isn't they must source the best damn ice cream company around. It is also rave worthy. . Added bonus, you can sit across from the Bellagio fountain show and enjoy some pretty snazzy ambiance. The service has been inconsistent, ranging from really good to terrible, but the food is just so good. 5 stars.
I made the reservation and noted it's for the 7 star player's birthday.. But the whole service was poor and fell below my fair experiences here in the past and upset my first-timer guest. . The hostess is new and never wore a smile on her face, no greetings and NO conversations on the way to our table. I asked her the information about the seats, and she told me she is new, so she doesn't know. Not Helpful staff at all.. The server was slow that we had to ask for refills every time for the coffee and beverage. The tuna burger was dry and very fishy.. Most people come here to enjoy the strip view and Bellagio water show. The tourists next to our tables asked the sever the time of water show, and his answer is he doesn't know. Not Helpful staff again. . And there was neither surprise nor a simple "Happy Birthday" from the staff.. I doubt I will come back here again.
This has always been one of my favorite spots in Vegas to eat simply because it is consistently good and the service always spot on..  The country pate',  frisee salad with bacon and egg is always a big hit, there crepes are a little thick for my taste but the fillings arealways great. I love the Bloody Mary bar, when I go for Sunday Brunch,  Steak  Frites  Is a signature and though it is not as good as  Steak Frites in NYC it is still fantastic. The waitstaff is always attentive in a European style, and are quick with answers.  Excellent Service makes many small issues in a restaurant forgiveable
Loved this place, oui, oui! We saw it while hungry & strolling along the strip...so glad we stopped in. If you see a line, wait in it...they have TONS of seating. I think the hostess is slow on purpose & a line makes it look happening. (We didn't wait in line, but there was one when we left). . Sat on the lovely patio...yummy French baguette (although a tad too crunchy...ripped up the roof of my mouth a tad). And the butter? Ahhh! Orgasmic. Creamy, salty, fresh churned tasting. . . The baked goat cheese is easily a 5-star dish: ah-mazing! Loved it & the creamy tomato sauce surrounding it. We licked the plate. Not really kidding. A MUST order.. . Perfect wine? Saint Bris savignon!! Crisp, cool, refreshing...two bottles down, a third was mighty tempting.. . For dinner, I loved the steak bernaise & frites. The frites were crunchy like potato chips...oh so good. The steak was thin, nicely pounded tender with some chew (think skirt steak). The creamy herby bernaise: muah!. . Go get it, Vegas! Parisian yumminess can be yours!
Exceptional service by the one and only Jose S. He catered to our table and made our experience phenomenal. Best server/service I've had in Vegas so far! Food was great, Frangria was amazing.
5 stars for the steak alone. We tried the Bourdalaise steak.. and oh my god, it's the juiciest and best steak I've had. The caramelized onions and sauce were so perfect. Definitely recommend and would definitely order again and again. . . I knocked off one star because the other dish, Tuna Nicoise Salad, was a bit underwhelming. The tuna was nicely seasoned/peppered, but everything else was just okay. The dish in its entirety was not worth $18. Would not order again. . . Overall, we had a great dining experience. Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly.Ambiance was very French (duh) and quaint. Try to get a table by the window; you'll see glimpses of the Fountains at Bellagio!. . Will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas.
Just love this place!  Best view in Vegas on the balcony.  You get to watch the fountain show while drinking fabulous French wine and noshing on steak frites!  I have only visited Vegas twice, but I made a point of coming back to Mon Ami the second time because it was such a delicious dinner the last time. Just beware, the steak is not a thick cut so it will be medium rare or higher in terms of doneness.  Bon appetite!
I can't afford to come here more than once a year, but it is my favorite special occasion restaurant in Vegas.  Gorgeous view, the food is delicious and they have a very solid gluten-free (and an extensive regular) menu, wine listand dessert options!  Even better, they are VERY flexible and happy to assist you in creating a gluten-free dish of your own if you see something on the regular menu that might be manipulated into a GF meal.  My go-to dinner (even though it's an appetizer, it's very generous) is the chicken liver mousse on gluten-free toast, but you really can't go wrong with almost everything on the menu.  The chocolate mousse is to die for, too!. . Also, if you're VERY careful, you can get out of there for less than $30...
So so.. patio seating preferred for nice picture scenery.. food was ok.. nothing special.. service is friendly.. they have bloody mary bar where you make your own.. warm baguette was good.. scallops were also good!  They might have better menu for dinner..
I'm sure my rating won't contribute much to the huge pool of reviews this fancy pants French bistro has amassed over the years...but I don't give a French. . . I came for lunch, although I intended to drop by in the evening because everyone raves about the spectacular views of the Bellagio Fountains show across the street. However, time did not permit so I decided that I would come for the food, not the views. Don't get me wrong, if you sit in the patio during the daytime, there is still plenty of pretty scenery for you. It's just easy to imagine how much better the views are during the night. . . Anyway, onto the food! My partner and I opted for two sandwiches: Maine Lobster Roll and the Sandwich Du Jour (sandwich of the day). Quick tip: warm sandwiches are served with Mon Ami Gabi's renowned hand-cut frites, while cold sandwiches are served with gaufrette potato chips (AKA waffle fries). These are less acclaimed but still great.. . The Maine Lobster Roll is served on a toasted brioche roll, accompanied with a side of red cabbage salad. If y'all did your research, you would know that Maine (and Northern New England) generally serves their lobster meat cold. Thus, our lobster roll was served with the gaufrette potato chips. I was expecting the hand-cut frites. It's no biggie though because I'm an equal opportunity fried potatoes consumer. These waffle fries were crisp and tasty. I didn't like the lobster roll because it was too buttery and rich for me but my boyfriend had no trouble devouring it. The roll was also smaller than I expected--hence, less lobster meat than what I anticipated. . . Our Sandwich Du Jour, on the other hand, was sensational! It was a seared ahi tuna sandwich served on a baguette with hand-cut frites. The ahi tuna was delicately seared on the outside, and left rare in the middle. It had a velvety texture. The mayo sauce contained a bit of zest and a lot of flavor. The baguette was hard but also packed a crunch. Now to the famous frites! I understand why they're famous: perfectly thin-cut slivers of potatoes and lightly seasoned with salt. These babies were fried to a beautiful golden brown. . . The patio seats are highly touted so the restaurant doesn't accept reservations for outdoor seating; they're on a first-come, first-served basis. Yes, the views are lovely but don't forget about the dishes! It's definitely one of the best meals I've had in Vegas. Service was all right. Prices are on the higher end but totally worth it--whether you're there for the view or the food.
I love this place. Although extremely crowded, I prefer an atmosphere with a lot of people as apposed to none. The place looks very fancy but there is also a casual presence to it. The outside seating provides an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains that cannot be matched. I had a pasta from here the last time I went, and I have yet to stop raving about it. It was the best pasta I have ever eaten in my life. Never have I tasted something so scrumptious and such a genuine flavor that I have never tasted before. The servers are always very effective and helpful. Even with the extreme amount of people, the service is grade A. I was amazed with my experience here.
Mon Ami Gabi was a fantastic place for Sunday brunch.  We started with the Bloody Mary bar, which had anything and everything you could think of to put in a Bloody Mary.  My husband and I split the chicken, apple, and brie crepes and the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. Everything was so delicious.  When we told our son where we ate, he said that when he went to LV, he ate at the Mon Ami Gabi three times in one week!! That says a lot. The atmosphere and staff made us feel like we were in Paris in a quaint bistro.
The food and service were good.. . I'd recommend the french onion soup, chicken liver pate, and mushroom crepe.. . Also, the view seating outside is nice because you get a good look at the Bellagio water fountain show.. . Everything on the Las Vegas strip is priced relatively on the higher end, that being said, this place gives a good bang for buck.
OMG not only does this place hold my name :) but also serves some seriously delicious breakfast.  I dub the "Chocolate-Hazelnut Waffle," the most delightful waffles I've ever had. They were the perfect crunch in our mouth, with just the right amount of chocolate, not overwhelming at all.  The restaurant itself it the cutest, very Schick decor, and cozy. I had great service and will return the next time I visit Vegas.
Excellent food, speedy service, and not too expensive for a nice dinner in Las Vegas. I had the steak frites and was very impressed with everything. Definitely make a reservation and try to get there early to sit on the patio if you can.
Came here for lunch on a Saturday.  The French onion soup is a must!  My chicken, mushrooms, kale and brie crepe was fabulous, those ingredients blended well together and the hollandaise sauce was not overbearing.  A carafe of the delicious and bunchy (yep, I make up words) St. Germain cocktail is the way to go.. . Venue Tips: If you go, try to get a spot on the patio before the hour strikes 2 pm, for a nice showing of the Bellagio fountains in action (the fountains start their thing beginning 2 pm, on the hour and through the evening).  Warning there is scant shade on the patio and you may be in full sun, so bring your sunscreen.
Superb steak and appetizers! Only 4 stars because their baguette was a bit too hard. I like to dip my bread into natural steak juice but the bread came out hard so I didn't get to enjoy my steak. Maybe next time.
Excellent! Wish i found this spot earlier in our trip.  I had "PARIS ROMANCE" drink.  Very good.  We had baked brie app. .. my only complaint was i wish there was more.  I had classic steak frites....mmmmmm. really good.  My partner had warm goat cheese salad.  She said it was great.  Don't miss this spot!
Such a cute restaurant on the strip!. . A friend recommended that I visit this place, and I'm glad I did. If you're not picky about where you sit (patio vs inside), I highly suggest making a reservation. My boyfriend and I had reservations at 6pm on a Friday night, and it was already pretty busy. There was a couple in front of us without reservations, and they had to wait 30-45 minutes for a table. . . My boyfriend and I got lucky, and we were seated by the window that looks out to the Bellagio fountains. It was a very romantic, intimate setting with only candlelights lighting the restaurant. . . We both ordered steak frites: the Bordelaise (carmelized onion & red wine sauce), and the Filet Mignon Merlot (butter, red wine reduction). Both were very good, but Filet Mignon Merlot was our favorite. The frites were more like crispy potato chips than fries, but they were very good. . . For dessert we ordered the profiteroles. The portion was HUGE. Between two people we could only eat about 2/3 of it. The pastry was a bit dry to me, so I wouldn't recommend this particular dessert. . . Overall, great food and service in a romantic setting. Worth the visit here if you want to wine and dine in Las Vegas.
Food was great! Service Was better. It was our last night of honeymoon and they surprised us with a double dessert. we loved it!
Located at the Paris hotel and casino.  We dropped in for a very late dinner.  This is a French bistro. When you enter from the Strip, it's to the left.  Inside the casino, it's called Mon Ami steakhouse.  That should have been a big clue.. . As it was late I wanted to eat light.  I ordered the sea scallops.  Big mistake.  It came and right away I could smell how fishy it was.  Means not very fresh!  Hubby ordered the wild boar with little rags of pasta.   We traded with each other as I didn't want to risk getting ill.  At this point it's like 10:30pm.  I didn't want to wait for another entree. . . Our friend ordered the hangar steak.  A winner.  Her hubby got the wild boar too.  Yuck. Chunks of wild boar with doughy pasta that stuck together.   Shouldn't the boar meat be shredded?. . They also got the Cesar salad and the French onion soup,   They enjoyed both.. . I got the house merlot.  Very good.  And they served a hot baguette in a paper bag.  Like a French bakery. Excellent bread.. . Bottomline - I enjoyed my glass of wine and the bread. . . Our server Girard was funny too.
Always delicious.  This is my 8th or 9th time at this restaurant.  It is one of my go to places in Vegas.  I go here with friends but also with clients.  Here are some of the highlights.. . 1) Great service. 2) Good and consistent food quality. 3) Ambiance is great but keep in mind it is a cafe setting so it is a bit noisy. 4) Reasonable pricing for Vegas center strip location. 5) Beverage cost not blow up.  Very nice bottle of wine for $80 (VERY REASONABLE). 6) Fountain show at the Bellagio. . Highly recommend.
Escargot sweet delicious little slimy snails soaked in pesto and oil, a great start to any french meal. They have duck on Tuesdays for their plate du jour. ordered the steak with carmelized onions and fries that areborderline chips and orderedseafood crepe. for the price this place was reasonable and it's French food! the location is perfect right across the street from the Bellagio fountains
Came here for breakfast, this is not their strong suit. The only reason I'm not giving 2 stars is because we sat outside on the patio, and the view of the Bellagio fountains and nice day made it much more enjoyable.. . First off, their coffee is $4 each, but right when you sit they start pouring. I knew they charged, but I feel like they should ASK the customer if they would like to purchase the coffee rather than just pour it and charge you. . . We got mostly omelette and one french toast to share. The omelettes were just average. For a French place I expected better. When I was in Paris, we had eggs and omlettes at a random cafe and they were cooked perfectly, I expect the same of Mon Ami when you're paying $13 for basically a few eggs. I got the turkey and egg white one. The turkey was flavorless and dry, the egg whites were dry, the avocado and tomato relish on top was forgetable. The french toast was just OK, I could probably make it at home. . . Basically, nothing stood out here except the ambiance and view. I MIGHT conisder coming back for lunch or dinner but with so many other, better options in Vegas that's probably not going to happen.
Finally, we had time to try this place. We made a reservation, (recommended), showed up a little early but we still got seated right away. . . All the tables in this place and they put us at a little table tucked in the corner right by the windows of the patio and in direct sunlight! Thank goodness it wasn't too warm, but did have a lot of glare!. . We ordered a couple of apps, the warm brie cheese, black pepper honey hazlenuts and croutons, and the jumbo crabcake with citron butter. The berie cheese was super warm, gouy and very good, a few cloves of roasted garlic, soft hazlenuts so good! The crab cake was very fresh, crab rich and the butter with a splash of acid in the lemon was right up there on the elite list of ceab cakes. Definetly recommend both apps!. . I also love french onion soup and ordered a bowl, it was cheesy and rich in beef broth, plenty of onions could have used just a bit more baguette, but overall very good.. . For the main event we both got the steak and frites, basically a very thin steak with some thinly cut fries. It was delicious but nothing more then just steak and fries. . . Finally we had the white chocolate bread pudding, not that good, dry needed the ice cream and the chocolate cake, at least it was warm and very moist smoothered in two types of sauces and walnut sprinkles. . . Very good service food was overall good, wouldn't mind trying their breakfast!
Shockingly surprised at how great this place was!!! Service and food were outstanding! Noise level is extremely high but it has great energy. Our server, Colby, deserves a special recognition. He was attentive and super nice. Spoke with passion about the courses and specials. Even went out of his way to get me a Rockstar energy drink (off menu). . . Tip: Make a reservation!!!! Don't wait for the patio seats, you might starve to death!
Overall eating experience was amazing. Had reservations to sit outside with an amazing view across the street of the Belagio water show. Perfect temperature to dine outside around 6pm. The service was perfect and the food was amazing. I ordered the salmon and salad entree and it was delicious. Fresh spinach and salmon cooked just right. Tried my first creme brulee there and it was the perfect ending to an amazing dinner.
That s a very nice place to have lunch. Beautiful view of the fountains. The foos is good and not overpriced. I recomand this restaurant.
Outside dining was great and The service was everything you would expect. Our waitress was attentive to our needs and gave good suggestions on the wine selection. The food portions were larger than expected and the French onion soup was very good.
This place was delightful! We went here for a late lunch and wanted to eat outside, and we barely had a 10minute wait. We ordered the baked goat cheese,the macaroni gratin and a caesar salad. Everything was delicious!! I wanted to go there again but my friend insisted on trying different places. I almost went there by myself when she left because it was so good. It is across from the Bellagio fountain so besides people watching (which you can do anywhere in Vegas) there was always a little fountain show going on. Highly recommend!
Food was great! Few little things like soda being filled with water and lack of patio heat but great otherwise.
I loved the ambiance and the outdoor patio at night. Our waitress was super nice too, but honestly, the food wasn't anything special. Everyone raved about this place but my chicken was dry and didn't have much taste. Same with my boyfriend's steak :(
Amazing. Food is spectacular. The quiche is to die for! Request for David to be your server, he was great.
I went here for lunch and the place was packed. I finally found a seat at the bar which I was glad to have. The bartender was wonderful and put up with my obnoxious "surprise me" request for a good drink and did not disappoint! I had the French onion soup and it was one of the best I've ever had. They had it down to a t. If you're looking for a great place to have a meal in Vegas I'd say this is in my top 3 recommendations!
Not terrible but nothing exceptional.
best steak I've ever had. best customer service. affordable lux food.
I'm harder on the so called finer dining restaurants.  I expect perfection for the premium price.  . . The waiter was far below par.  The main menu said ask for our gluten free menu, we did.  The guy literally said, "I'd have to go to the front to get it."  THEN GO GET IT!  I'm not sure if it was a gag or what, but I felt like a nuisance as opposed to a guest.. . The food was good.  I had a filet, well cooked, needed salt.  Wife had chicken that was well prepared.. . We dined on a night in which a marathon was passing on the main strip.  The people and the Bellagio fountain made for great ambiance, combined with good food, just let down by the wait staff.
Gazillions have yelped about MAG. Yet in this business you are only as good as your last plate served. So the road to 5 stars or hell is one plate at a time. Our party of four dined Sunday evening. Our table was in the atrium looking out at the marathon, the water show across the street and the outdoor diners, where it was cold, but with those tall heaters. The selections we made ran the gamut from oysters to steak, crab to onion soup,  banana crepes, for dessert. All dinners were top rate. The steak, I was told, was better than Ramsey's but for half the price. Our waiter, Anthony was excellent. Price reasonable. Service superb. Food outstanding. Now, if you can deliver value for money, you too could have a gazillion yelpers yelping.
I've reviewed this before and I've been here right times.  I won't go back and I will stop recommending this place.  For many reasons.  . . They charge 18% gratuity on parties of 5 or more.  We were six and the service was horrible.  She saw us twice. Once for order and once to give us the check.  No refills. No checking. Nothing.   We were going to tip 10% and to our amazement it was mandatory 18%.  I called the manager.  He came over and I told him the issue and to remove the 18%. Instead of apologizing, he put the blame back on us and said we should have asked for him.  Bottom line - we were blamed by the manager and the blame is put back on us. It shows issues not just by staff but by management. I said no and we would just walk out. He reluctantly removed the 18% and dropped the check back on our table. NO APOLOGY.  . . The steak was overcooked for most of us. The mean was so so this time.  Its just a disappointment and there are tons of other options so I highly recommend if you are a party of 5 or more - be careful.  . . The place is very dark too - hard to read menus and the chairs are wicker and uncomfortable- mostly to make the tables turn quicker.   It's obviously about the money there rather than service.  Go elsewhere.. . I got the impression she was mad they sat a party of 6 at an 8 table.  We didn't want wine because we already drank and I thought she felt we weren't a big value table.  So figured she got 18% automatically and that was enough.  It wasn't crowded.  Amazed she never checked with us.   For a restaurant to make 18% mandatory for 5 or more shows they have service issues.   Usually it's 6 or 8.
Excellent brunch menu.  This cafe is part of the Paris hotel/casino.  Fun French bistro with a wide variety of menu items.  It is worth the wait for patio and garden seating.  You have a great view of the Bellagio fountains while you eat.  Great staff and service.
Great spot right on the strip. Lunch and breakfast are perfect for a heavy day of walking. The breakfast benny's are all good (tried them all) as well as the Nutella waffles. Make a reservation and prepare for $15 a person plus drinks. One of my fave spots to eat directly on the strip.  Great spot for the whole family if you sit outside.
Review is for brunch on the patio on a Tuesday morning at 9 am.. Service was great, french toast and quiche were awesome!! St. Germain drink was awesome, I even googled the recipe for it.  Price is VERY reasonable Vegas, I would defiantly come back here for again for lunch and dinner.
The food was decent. Servicer was terrible. They charge me for two bottles I stole ..... Wtf .
The steak was delicious. The service was amazing. The ambiance was nice also. I was a little disappointed in how much my drinks cost though. The two drinks I had was almost the same price of my steak dinner. The size of my steak was also good. Typically I feel like I never get what I pay for steak wise, but I did here.
Loved this place! Came for a late brunch and had one of the best experiences ever! First off on Sat and Sun they have a wonderful make-your-own bloody bar. Delish. After that we were brought a warm baguette with perfectly salted butter. Soon our entrees arrived; Blueberry French toast and egg Benedict. The best French toast of my life - perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside served with chantilly cream. I will come back!
Mon Ami Gabi is a French bistro located in the Paris Hotel.  I went on the recommendation of a friend who claims it as his favorite Las Vegas restaurant, as well as largely positive Yelp! reviews.  . . The interior of the restaurant is dark and dim, with walls loaded with various French-inspired memorabilia.  In any event, I'd suggest sitting outside, which provides prime people-watching territory on the strip.. . The bulk of the menu consists of simple bistro classics like mussels and steak frites.  I had steak frites; my flat-iron steak was cooked a perfect medium-rare, as ordered.  Entrees come with a choice of sauce.  I ordered bearnaise, and it was perfect.  I had the privilege of sampling the food of my dining companions, and enjoyed it as much as they did.  One of them ordered a bowl of mussels in buttery, herbaceous white wine broth, and the other ordered a NY-strip with butternut squash puree and bordelaise sauce.  As I said, each item was properly prepared and delicious.. . Our waitress was polite and fairly attentive, considering that the restaurant was fairly busy during our dinner.  My only real complaint about the meal was the "frites" component of my steak frites.  I found them to be too thin, a bit dry, and cold.  Maybe they were pre-cooking large batches far ahead of time in reaction to the large number of customers.  That would be unfortunate.. . Overall, however, the positives far outweighed the negatives of my visit.  Mon Ami Gabi is a damn good place to get a steak in a great, casual environment, at a far lower price than a traditional American steakhouse.
A roulette dealer told me that the food quality in Vegas restaurants has really gone downhill, perhaps due to the rising meat prices. I came here in 2010 and had a lovely steak dinner. This time around I pondered trying something else so I inquired about the scallops. The waitress highly recommended them so I went for it. My friend ordered the chicken grand mere. Bread came promptly and was quite good, accompanied by whipped butter. We sat outside on a Tues early evening under a heat lamp and enjoyed the people watching. It was early enough to get a seat outside (around 6 I believe) as by the time we left the once-empty inside was full. Sadly my scallops, all four of them, arrived cold and were chewy and very bland. The squash puree was a cool temperature and there were only about five brussel sprouts on my plate. Good thing I'd eaten a lot of bread. I sent back the scallops and was told they'd be reheated. The waitress and busboy were very nice and caring. I have nothing bad to say about the service other than the waitress's bad call on the scallops. I was offered a complimentary refill of my rose champagne as I waited for my meal. Meanwhile my friend was pretty happy with his chicken but not in amazement by any means. It was juicy and was a good amount of chicken. Potato puree was tasty as were the roasted garlic and onions. Just don't expect very much of the sides. Scallops came back to me warmer but I had zero love for them. I ate them because I was hungry. They really really needed some kind of sauce. I think I know what rubber soles taste like now. It was my birthday and I was given a profiterole which was tasty. The two meals with two glasses of $11 champagne (not counting my complimentary one) plus tip came to $112. Disappointing since I'd felt like I had to force myself to eat the scallops. No enjoyment at all. Like several other places i revisiting on this trip after great experiences in 2010, I'm crossing Mon Ami Gabi off my list and will search for more consistently good places to patronize.
I have been meaning to write a review about this restaurant for quite some time now! This place is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE brunch place in Las Vegas!!! If your in Vegas for the weekend you NEED to come here for brunch and sit on the patio. Sitting on the patio makes the whole experience. This restaurant is at the Paris Hotel and you can watch the Bellagio water show as you sit in the sun on the patio talking to friends. AMAZING! Have to always come here when I'm in Vegas.
Full of French favorites. Came here for brunch, but note breakfast food isn't served after 11am, though they still will make some breakfast options all day. We loved our server Maggie. She's super attentive, welcoming and really helpful. Maggie could be one of the best servers I've experienced. . . There are multiple rooms each with very different lighting ranging from very dark, to outside on the patio. (Clearly I'm suffering from a hangover).. . LARGE BLOODY BAR. lots to choose from . . APPS. Hand-Cut Potatoes Chips - YES! . . Brussels Sprouts - excellent. Nice and toasty. . SALAD. Warm Goat Cheese Salad - excellent salad with roasted tomatoes, and yes a heaping serving of warm goat cheese. This could be it's own meal.. . ENTREE . Seafood Crepes - Blew my mind! A must try. Scallops and shrimp.. . Mac and Cheese - very tasty with options to add scallops or chicken.
7 of us went tobreakfast yesterday and all of us loved the entire experience . I had the smoke salmon Benedict  that was fantastic . highly recommend ...also sit outside if possible ... Very nice .
Pretty good food with a great view of the Vegas strip and the Bellagio fountains.  Came here for brunch on the morning my friends got to Vegas.  We came in thinking there'd be a wait around 11:30am, but they surprisingly had seats open.  The food here is moderately expensive, but the food is fair for the price.  I had the blueberry waffles and a side of bacon.  Both were excellent.  The waffles here are a lot different from what I have had before.  They're very airy and light and are full of vanilla flavor.  It was great with the blueberries.  Overall a great experience, and if you eat on the patio, you get an awesome view.
We enjoyed our breakfast this morning! Got to sit inside but by the window which allowed for people watching but in the warmth. Server was very informative...in fact, I don't think my coffee cup got below a half before she was filling it up. Finally found a tasty Bloody Mary! It was no "New Orleans Bloody Mary by any stretch" but it was the best we found in Vegas. The bananas foster waffles were just as they described...crunchy on the outside and light and fluffy on the outside. Loved them (see picture)! However, if you get nothing else have a side of bacon. It was delicious!
Such a cool place.  Food was great.  Staff was wonderful. My favorite was the view of the Bellagio water show playing to Frank Sinatra.
I have not been to Mon Ami Gabi for about 10 years.  I don't remember it being too great, but I thought I would give it another try last week.  I was traveling in Vegas for work, and having dinner solo that evening.  I went in around 8:30pm and sat at the bar.  The first thing I noticed was the numerous servers standing around, and just chatting with each other.  They were definitely overstaffed.. . I got the bartenders attention, and ordered a glass of Bordeaux.  I was bothered that she served it to me in a small white wine glass.  I noticed that other patrons were served in Bordeaux glasses, but she elected to just quickly give it to me.  She even opened a new bottle, and did no offer me a taste.. . This was basically how the entire meal went for me.  I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt, and she definitely gave the attention to an older gentleman wearing a suit at the end of the bar. I usually don't weigh service as an issue at restaurants, but I do take offense when I am ignored for wearing a t-shirt, or if nobody says goodbye to me when i leave.  I definitely had an experience with both of these at the restaurant.. . To eatm I had the filet and a side salad.  Both were mediocre, and nothing fantastic.  If I was rating the food alone, this would be a 3 star dinner.  However, the service clearly makes me drop Mon Ami down by at least a star.  In my opinion, for the price, 2 stars is very generous.  I suggest passing and trying another french bistro (Bouchon or DB Brasserie).
Great place to have lunch!!!!!. Perfect location: right across from Billagio, very tasty food, great wine, good service. . I ordered salmon salad with walnuts, dried cranberries and avocado with citrus dressing and it was really good. My husband had mussels and oysters that were yummy too. . The only this I didn't like is that they serve their wine in small wine glasses and they fill it up more that half a glass so you can't even swirl the wine.. Will definitely recommend this place.
I took my mother here on a mom-son date an early birthday gift for her. I must say the food, wine, and atmosphere was phenomenal. We arrived around brunch time when the traffic really picked up. The patio wait list was 45-60 min so we opted for indoor dining instead. We were sat right away towards the strip so we had the gorgeous view of the Bellagio. I ordered the  Bordelaise Steak Frite and my mom ordered the Chicken Paillard. Each of us ordered a glass of Pinot Merlot. I must say, my steak was close to, if not being, the best steak I've ever had. My mothers dish was exceptionally delicious as well. We asked one of the staff, Richard Uzi, to take a picture of us. One of the most humbling and friendly people. His character really brought our dining experience to the next level. Will definitely return here and recommend this place to friends.
Came here for thanksgiving dinner. Gotta say everything was pretty delicious.....except for the turkey.  We got lucky and there was patio seating available which gaveus a perfect view of the bellagio fountains.  It's kinda funny to think that a main draw of this restaurant is based off of its view of a competing hotel.  The endive salad was really good, but the smoked salmon was amazing. Kinda wish I had double of that instead of my turkey. I simply cannot dock this restaurant because I thought their white meat of their turkey was exceptionally dry.  Any other day of the year I would never order turkey.  Lastly, I had pumpkin bread pudding. I usually don't love bread pudding, it's more of my gf's thing, but this time it was amazing. So rich and moist. Too bad it's probably a seasonal item.  I'll likely be back, next time to try a steak or something.
No complaints about this place. The food was great as well as the service even though the place was packed.
Love the ambience of this dining experience. Good French food, quality service and fun! You really do feel like your in Paris! Located adjacent to the Eiffel Tower and on the Las Vegas Strip!
Terrific ambience and skillful waitservice at this bistro cafe in the Paris hotel. Wonderful breakfast -- our 10-year-old loved the peach parfait, and the grownups dug the crepes. Outdoor seating is a great way to start the day, indoor has a lot of character. This place is classier than the casino that houses it, and 10x better food than its neighbor, the Sugar Factory.
I love this place.  I have a lot of really good memories at this place.  I was here when I turned 21.  I was here for a girls clubbing marathon weekend in my mid 20's.  I was here before I eloped with my hubby and Elvis walked me down the aisle.  A lot of major milestones in life was spent here.. . The wait here isn't bad but definitely make a reservation.  They seat you within 5 min of your arrival if you make a reservation.  The service here is always immaculate.  Food is always amazing.  The french bread they serve is always the right amount of soft on the inside and crusty on the outside.   I always get the steak and pomme frites.  They offer it with different kinds of sauces so there's always something new to try even if you're mostly a carnivore like me.  Love love love this place.  I always eat here when I'm in Vegas.
