Love this place, my favorite sushi restaurant in vegas. Food is great..always. the Peruvian Corn is a must try..very friendly staff..Service is amazing!
Amazing food, horrible waitress, we asked for a teaspoon and she said they don't have any, then brings a teaspoon anyways???? Idiot! She should be fired.
Wonderful experience here!. My husband and I wanted to go for one nice dinner and I chose this place because I'm lazy (it was in the same hotel complex) and because I am a sushi addict.. . I was expecting outrageous prices, but honestly? It was super decent. We ordered two rolls (one being a spicy salmon roll which they made even though it wasn't on the menu), steak kebabs and peruvian rice. Came to less than $50 for both of us and we were totally satisfied.. . After our meal the waiter asked if we were celebrating anything and we informed him we were on our anniversary trip. They came out with a gorgeous little plate with chocolate writing, saying "Happy Anniversary" and two luxury cake pops dipped in pop rocks. It was awesome.. . If I ever return to Vegas I am coming back to this place!
SO good
It's everything you've waited for. Expensive but worth it. . . Seriously just go in there and grab some drinks, let the waiter take care of you. Everything is great and the vibe is chill vegas style   . . Suggested drink is Hendricks and tonic with cucumber. Delicious. Different.  Try it. . . . The sea bass melts in your mouth. Unbelievable!. . Go in there ready to get the party started. It will exceed your expectations. . . . Our waiter name is Justin. He wasn't bad but busy. . Only reason I didn't give a 5 is because there was some slack in service. At one point we received dessert menus and then didn't see a waiter for 10 min and we had to ask for him. Just a little disappointing since the meal was so expensive. I expect personalized service. . . . I did let the manager know and Jeremy took care of us. He let us know what the reason was as to why Justin was extra busy which was a valid point. I appreciated the transparency.
This sushi restaurant is horrible, do not waste your money here. Extremely expensive for what your getting. I piece of salmon sushi that is about 1.5 inches of fish for  7 dollers. spend 87 dollers for food that did not get myself and my gf full. The place is very nice and modern but the food is horrible. if you like your money do not go there!!!
This was the one restaurant I made a point not to miss in my last trip to Vegas but it ended up not being remarkable and the service was next to terrible. I know it's Vegas, but this was the only restaurant that I felt was overpriced. While the decor/vibe is cool, it's just like any other upscale Asian fusion restaurant these days. Both of our dishes were average, and my duck had too much of a saturated lime taste.. . The waygu gyoza, however, lived up to its reputation and was so lively in flavor. I should have just ordered three sets of these and I would have been happy with my meal.. . On a side note, this restaurant was so hard to find! Oh my gaaaaawwww... I've been to Venetian and Palazzo hundreds of times and didn't have a clue where this was tucked away at. We had to stop and ask for directions a few times, and half of those people who were EMPLOYEES had no idea how to get here.
Everything here is delicious. Almost Minus one star for not really having salmon belly. Hamachi belly and real wasabi root definitely worth it. The yellowtail tacos is small but refreshingly great. Pork belly always awesome. The sea bass miso very well flavored, highly recommend.
Had the pleasure of going to happy hour and seeing my friends Yaz, Isaballa, Jason and newbies Kat and Lynn. Rico "suave" from Puerto Rico makes a fantastic Mojito second only to Yaz although we have not has a Yaz mojito in quite a while. We missed Megan but will look forward to seeing all the gang so time next year. . . Food is excellent. If you are at or near Palazzo you have to go here. Sit at the bar from 4-7 and enjoy happy hour or take you team here on the company dime and let Isabella and Jason take great care of you.  . . I never give max stars because there is always room to improve. :). Love you guys at Sushi Samba Vegas. We'll look for Jason in Coral Gables.
Fun place with a great vibe. I have been to the SS in NYC and loved that as well. . . In Lost Wages, everything is bigger and splashier so it is no surprise that this SS has a huge bar and restaurant with really good food.. . We went last Saturday night and met the front desk staff Jason and Jeremy who took very good carte of us and even sent over a scallop wrapped in some sort of dough deal that was fantastic. We also had a crunchy roll and a yellowtail with jalapeno that rocked. . . Wine list was good, not great. Drinks might be a better way to go in the booze department. . . Staff was friendly and quick. maybe a touch too quick, but all was good in the end. . . Its a beautiful space in the Palazzo/Venetian shopping center so lots of other cool stuff to help you spend your money if there is a wait. Or, you can always go downstairs and gamble (I hear they have that in vegas now!). . I'd go back next time. Solid pace as Frank might say.
One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas!  Love the sea bass skewers and the muqueca!!!
My girlfriend and I went to Sushisamba for a late lunch the other day.  I ordered the rio grande churrasco plate and a mojito from the bar.. . The churrasco was very tasty and its a good portion.  It comes with 3 different types of meat, rice and beans with some greens and three variations of chimichuri.  . . I would Definatly recommend eating at Sushisamba!
I was in LV for a girls weekend and we decided to hit up SushiSamba on Saturday night.  The atmosphere was great....the food was INCREDIBLE and our server, Tanice was fun and so accommodating.. . We decided to have the chefs prepare dishes for us....best...decision...ever!. One of the girls is gluten free, so most of our courses were GF...and the ones that weren't, they made a special dish just for her. .  . They also have a giant selection of sake....we ordered a couple of bottles.. . I would definitely go there again.....ask for Tanice...she's the best!
I give Crispy scallop 5 stars, rainbow hexagon roll 4.5 stars and 5stars for the sashimi. BUT we waited for the pork belly ramen for at least 30 mins. While we were still eating the waitress placed our bill on our table. SO RUDE!! Stone shrimp tempura tastes weird and is not the regular fluffy crispy tempura I've seen before. Pricey. Ewwwwwwwww I gave them a minimum of 15%tip. I wish I could give them 0 dollars tip.
This spot gets it.. . Sushi is about: great food & great atmosphere.. SushiSAMBA gets em both and even leaves room for surprise.. . Chili oil edamame gets it goin' . Sea bass skewers keeps it goin' . Yellowtail sashimi with that fire sauce keeps it on point . Samba sushi roll brings it home while the *great service* tucks you in for a great night.. . Go here.  Fo sho.. Fire'n!
I was very impressed by the staff here.  I brought my sister for her 21st and we had a great time.  The food was on point.   I mean everything we ordered was delish.. At the very end of the dinner they brought over a couple shots for her.  Everytime I eat here I have a great experience! Thank you :)
I loved this place. The food was really great. I loved the decor. Order the corn...it's to die for. We ordered sushi as well...and it was good too. A little pricey but worth it.
Food is good not great. Portions are very small. No presentation - very basic  . Overpriced for what we've received. Service is ok. Location is nice!
Got filet mignon (medium), salmon-avo roll, soft shell crab roll, snow crab Cali roll, and miso Chilean sea bass. Soft shell crab was pretty soft, salmon pieces were really tasty, and definitely LOVED the Chilean sea bass. Sea bass was very soft. However, the filet mignon was a bit dry... That's where my minus one star goes. Server was nice! They also have omakase if you want :) it's of course pricey since it's Vegas!  But good experience overall :D
Delicious food and awesome service.. . I had the spicy lemongrass ramen, tuna tataki, lamb robata, organic chicken robata, yellowtail tacos, coconut rice, anago nigiri, unagi nigiri, and sao paulo sushi roll.. . All of the food were delicious! This place is a fusion of japanese, peruvian, and brazilian. Most of the portion sizes were tapa style,so you gota order several dishes.. . The ramen was well flavored with the spices. The noodle itself were ok, but all of the veggies and porkbelly were soaked in the broth, which made them all taste delicious.. . I don't have much complaint, maybe I can go without the tacos and chicken robata. You have to try the lamb because it's super tender and well flavored. The portion is slightly bigger, but order more if needed.. . Rolls were small, but it's cute and has plenty of fish to rice ratio.. . I would come back again!
