You want some good German beer and food with great atmosphere? Then this is the spot in Vegas. Awesome staff. Great food. Delicious beer. Came here during their Oktoberfest, awesome! They celebrate it Oct 1st-31st. Take a shot and get paddled!!
To celebrate Oktoberfest we went to Hofbrauhaus. I forgot that a friend told me that you get seated with strangers on the big long table. I asked the waitress if we can sit somewhere but she kindly rejected. The strangers were guys from Toronto and they were pretty funny and photo bombed us. The food was good, I remember having the famous Bavarian sausage. The price was high though. My friend ordered chicken salad and it was something like $16 she read the menu wrong. There is a section below the entree where it says chicken add this price shrimp add this price . Anyways she thought she could have a better dinner elsewhere. The place is huge with high ceiling. It was very entertaining and loud. A man comes around with big horn and put it on each table and people put money inside and ladies walk around selling shot and the men get paddled. There is German music and every now and then they would cheer and everyone on the table cheered "Ein Prosit! Zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke, hoi, hoi, hoi, Zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke, hoi, hoi, hoi. Prosit.". LOL! Good times!!
Fun German Octoberfest.  Be sure and order a shot, you'll be glad you did! ;-). . I think if you're in Las Vegas, and want to break away for some fun drinking and eating, this is a great alternative.  You won't feel like you're in Vegas, you'll be transported to Bavaria for a bit.
Hadn't been here for a few years and stopped in last night with a few friends. Beers are way too frickin' expensive at $9 for a pint. The bratwurst deal my buddy bought had the skinniest sausage on the planet and way too much bread, see picture.. . Really dead with hardly anyone there and the hostess lied on the phone saying Monday was a great night with a good crowd. Our waitress was mediocre and the band was pretty boring to be honest.. . We won't be going back.
Very good schnitzel and good service, but the apple strudel was not very sweet and the place is super duper loud.  Its a big German beer hall with lots of people laughing and shouting.  All of the noise bounces of the walls and you cannot hear any conversation.  Good beer too.
Food was absolutely amazing. First time here, I ordered the snitzel combo which was one of the specials for today and got a liter mug of beer. I'm not usually a beer drinking but I loved the beer! The live band was pretty amazing as well. Overall the atmosphere, the band, the service was great! I will definitely be coming back again!
Pretty cool I guess I mean not bad for a slow Thursday night. Well me and a friend were in Vegas for short weekend getaway from LA and on our first night we decided to go across the street from our hotel (HardRock) and check this place out. Mainly because he is more of a beer guy and big German culture fan. Anyways we got here around 7:15 or so on a Thursday night and it was somewhat busy but at the same time kinda low energyish and meh. Again your in Vegas so don't expect to find a super big German area like Alpine village so go figure lol. We had a sausage platter sampler thing and it was pretty good as well as a few beers and just enjoyed and kinda relaxed while listening to live music and enjoying some people watching. All in all it was ok not the best but cant complain too much either. The sound system ,I will say, is not the best kinda off balanced and somewhat all over the place half of the time you don't know if they are speaking or singing in English, German or just hard to understand muffled something because yea the sound system is not the best. If I was in the area and just wanted sit around drink beers and enjoy somewhat of a German American ambiance I would defiantly think about coming here again. But if your not particularly a beer person or a fan of uncomfortable seating then maybe pass on this place blah.
First time there,I was  in serious bratwurst withdrawals.  Ordered the combo plate of chicken, pork, and something else, with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut.  Wasn't do thrilled with the sauerkraut, the rest was awesome.wife had pork rotary and gravy I helped her to finish. Also really good. Place is rather loud, but the food was great. Will rotten again
I'm not a fan of the German beer or festival but the ambiance and the music was pretty cool.  I could not remember the name let alone say what I ordered but it was basically a thin piece of pork lightly battered with a side of cranberry sauce.  It was pretty damn good and the portion size was huge. I didn't order a beer and was called a girly man by the pretty german waitress. HAHAHA funnay.   This place looks fun once your drunk and in the moment.  the ziggy ziggy oi oi oi was fun.
Stopped in for lunch on our 1st day in Vegas-my husband had a burger, the patty was big n juicy, the rest of us had some kinda schnitzel - that was the reason for coming, we wanted to try German food . Live music, the DJ has a strong German accent that was hard to understand, either that or due to the amount of beer he's drinking, not sure which.. Regardless , he was very entertaining - service was good-glad we came.
I never had real German food until I tried this place. I ordered a white asparagus soup which was oh so tasty. It was creamy and flavorful.. . I ordered the chicken sausage which was okay. Ever since I tried the sauerkraut, I've been craving it.. . The atmosphere is fun and people here have a good time. There's live music and people are just happy and friendly.
Eh.. . The beer is tasty when you're on an empty stomach.. . we arrived 2 hours before they closed and our waitress wasn't really helpful and seemed urged to close our tab.. . the food was Ok, I had the curry dish. the prices are above average, especially for the pint of beer I had. . . would recommend it if it's your first time or if you're a tourist (which i'm not). . Oh, and they sat us aaaall way in the back where nobody was at while they had a live band playing up front, I guess the host's really look out for certain waitresses/servers. . . you won't see me coming here again...
