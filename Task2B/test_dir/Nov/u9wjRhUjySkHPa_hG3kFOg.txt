This was a truly great hotel. The service, the room, and the amenities were all really a cut above anywhere I've stayed before. I loved the location on the strip.  North of the REALLY congested part of the strip (think Bellagio and Caesar's Palace) it's really easy to get in the car to explore downtown Vegas from the Wynn.  If you're not into exploring, there are plenty of things to do without leaving Wynn/Encore, even if you're not a gambler or don't want to play at the higher stakes they spread at the Wynn. The only knock is the price of everything, but we knew that going in. We found the elevated sidewalks to the Venetian and the shopping mall across the street very convenient. If you have the opportunity, stay here. You won't regret it.
Terrible service.. Just awful. Literally paid $84 for two juices. Paid extra to have delivery guy come to room, hotel did not allow and actually blamed this on the delivery guy who was quick to defend himself. Money trap!! Don't bother
I've stayed at several hotels in Vegas and thus one takes the cake!!   In a league of it's own.   Extremely clean, extremely beautiful and worth every penny.
Wynn and Encore is still one of my top choices in Vegas.. . 1. They always have fresh flowers as decor on their first floor garden.. . 2.  Service is great the 1st 2 times i went there.  3rd time i stayed there, instead of checking in at 2pm I arrived at 8:30pm which should have given them enough time to clean up. however when i arrived they had me wait 20 minutes at check in to find out that my room was still dirty and not cleaned!   we reserved 2 rooms and had special big birthday celebration.  Front desk person who helped us apologized and asked us to wait longer instead of offering anything to make it up.  Unfortunately we had to ask to speak to someone of higher authority to get slight upgrade. Afterwards, they surprisingly sent complimentary chocolate upstairs after they knew we were celebrating special occasion.. . 3.  Love their design, high ceilings and beautiful and tasteful architectural design.  I also like how when we open the door the curtains open at the same time so we can see the entire view from the top.. . 4.  The 1st floor casino, unlike some other casinos, is not real smokey.. . 6. The Wynn Buffet is one of the best, but Wicked Spoon and Bucchanel are also both great!
One of best hotels in the world. The Wynn hotel is located on the old Desert Inn hotel. It's the only hotel on the strip with a golf course. If you are a person who loves the European decor and beautiful artwork you are in for a treat. As we all know Las Vegas has a lot hotels from low end to high end. . . If you are a person who enjoys high end hotels you must give this hotel a try. The casino is done with outstanding artwork with great art finishing. If you are a high roller or a person plays the slot you will enjoy the great casino layout. The hotels is gorgeous from  A to Z. If you are a picky person when it comes to hotel beds you are going to love the beds here. . . If you are coming to Vegas you must give the spa a try. One of the best spas in the world. If you are buffet lover you will enjoy the outstanding food. I highly recommend  the Sinatra for high end dinning. If you are looking for something more low key check out the country club. You can have lunch over the patio that overlooks the golf course. . . Being a big fan of Caesars Palace for may years the Wynn is my new playground in Vegas. All the way around this is a 5 star resort.
I don't even know where to begin.  I just arrived back from a weekend getaway to Vegas and stayed at the Wynn for the first time.  We booked this hotel because for years we've been getting deals in the mail and since we were heading to Vegas for a Birthday weekend, we thought we should take advantage of the generous deal the Wynn keep sending us.  Mind you, we've never stayed at the Wynn before, but the deal we got included a discounted rate for two nights, a $75 dining credit to Andreas (a fancy Asian themed restaurant in the hotel), and two tickets to Le Reve.  To say this was a good deal is an understatement.. . This is a posh hotel, but we didn't feel out of place at all.  It's comfortable and all the staff we encountered was more than friendly and accommodating.  Check in was smooth and our room request was granted (looking for a quiet room with a view).  The decor in the casino and throughout the hotel is top notch.  It's not overly done, just inviting and beautiful.  The flowers and high end atmosphere is really well done.. . Once we got to our room, we were blown away.  It is so nice. I loved the fresh, clean vibe.  I would pick the furniture/decor for my own home, if only I could afford it.  The  White leather with pops of color on the walls is spot on.  The view, even from the 14th floor was great.  The best part... the drapes and lights close with push of a button.  You can operate your privacy sign/service request as well as the air conditioning with a push of a button right by your bedside.  One thing to not however, is that though the hotel is very quiet, it is in the flight path for the airport.  Planes are flying overhead all the time as are helicopters... not a problem, but they are noticeable for sure - bring ear plugs if you are sensitive.. . All of the restaurants a the hotel that we ate at were great (see other reviews).  The show was excellent, unique and interesting.  The pool is comfortable, upscale, and super nice - it was quite enjoyable laying out at the start of our day.  In fact, I'd love to experience one of their cabanas some day.  Honestly, we had a great time at the Wynn.  I'm not sure I can stay anywhere else in Vegas going forward... it was that good!
I go back and forth about whether I prefer the Encore or the Wynn more.  They're kind of a #1A and #1B for my favorite places to stay on The Strip.  . . You can tell the aspects Steve learned from after the Bellagio: there's a waterfall/water show, but you can't see it unless you're inside the property.  Restaurants offer outdoor seating.  The club scene is as good as it gets, if that's your thing.  There is the small conservatory section, but it's between the taxi entrance and the casino (not off to the side).  There must have been some psychological research to show that people prefer the Wynn's red color scheme to the Bellagio's yellow.  Le Reve's theater is very intimate, and every seat in the house is close to the action.    . . With that said, if you're deciding between the Wynn and the Encore:. . Encore is quieter, and I like the rooms more... but, it's also farther away from everything.  Wouldn't think the extra nudge north would matter, but those extra steps add up if/when you explore The Strip.  . . The Wynn is livelier, but some aspects of it are borderline (sometimes over that border) gaudy.  They have significantly more tables than the boutique Encore, so I usually find myself gambling at the Wynn if I'm staying at either.
The Wynn is amazing - obviously it hasn't won all the awards and notoriety for being average. The service, the rooms, the restaurants, the bars, the shops, the pool - it's all fantastic and beautiful and if you can afford it, it's definitely worth a stay. It is a bit of a walk from what I would consider the central point on the strip, but they have everything you need in a Vegas stay right here so if you didn't want to leave, you really wouldn't have to. The average age of the crowd leans toward the older side, which is expected for a more upscale hotel and casino, and that could be a plus or a negative for you - for us, it was a plus. Simply stunning and I hope to return.
not a place for nonsmokers. the minute you walk in to check in, the nasty cigarette smell linger all over you. we were having a hard time breathing, our eyes turn red and smell like a smoker.  anywhere you want to go, you have to pass the nasty smoker smell. don't bring your kids here.
I always go to/stay at Wynn when i go to Vegas. And I go pretty regularly. Not after this time though. . . The bell people scratched my limited edition bag and when I called to file the complaint they asked if I would be willing to let someone come to my room "right now" to get the report. I said ok. 30+min later still no one. I had just arrived for my ONE NIGHT trip so it's not like I had plenty of time to casually wait around for them. I called again and finally someone shows up. I asked why they didn't come when they said they would. They fed me some bs "we had a medical emergency" line. Oh really? For a property that big you have just ONE guy handling medical emergencies and guest property damage? I work at a hotel myself and know this is not the case. . . so this security guy is inspecting my bag. He's sweating up a storm while wiping his sweat with his bare hands and then proceeding to touch my bad repeatedly, transferring all that sweat onto my bag. Then he PICKS at the paint scuffs making it worse. I had to literally tell him to STOP. he kept insisting it was a transfer and could be picked off. It cannot. This is a limited edition bag and LV themselves told me it is screen printed and will get scratched if mishandled. . . He apparently thought he knew better by repeatedly trying to convince me it was dye. It's not dye. . . Anyway, I put in the complaint, two days later someone calls me to tell me they refuse to take liability for damaging my bag but "AS A GESTURE OF GOOD WILL" they will just pay for cleaning or give me $100. my bag was in PRISTINE condition and a cleaning will absolutely not remove the damage. This was confirmed by LV as well. The fact that this hotel devalued my property by way more than $100 and refused to do anything about it other than offer a measly cleaning/pennies only cuz of "good will" with no apology whatsoever says a lot about them. . . So wasting my valuable vacation time, my time to travel down to LV to get it assessed, and of course the actual damage itself was only worth $100 or a cleaning to them. Wow. . . I will not be patronizing this establishment anymore. Horrible customer service.. . All I see when I look at my beautiful bag now are the unsightly scuff marks.
Went to stay there for 4 nights. Let me tell you I was very impressed.. . Checking in we were greeted right away, plus we upgraded to a higher floor. That was really worth it they put us on the 58 floor. The view was just awesome! Plus the room was very clean.. . I'm just going to keep it short and say I am definitely going to be back! If you want a nice place to stay this is the place!
Wish I could stay in this hotel but I can't pay those high rates.  The slot machine selection is awesome!!!  Lots of variety and the workers are too notch.  One day, I will stay here.
The best in vegas. Incredible food everywhere, with Vegan options at each of their restaurants, very friendly staff, and lots to see. No one does it like the Wynn. Not the least expensive on the strip- far from it really. However, I feel that the cost is exceeded by value
My favorite hotel in Las Vegas if not the world! If i could give it 10 stars, I would. Once you stay here once you'll see why it's a top rated hotel & if you're smart, you won't stay elsewhere again. . . The resort is classy & luxurious without being pretentious.  All the staff are friendly & beyond accommodating.  You can literally press a button & get anything you want delivered to you within about 15 minutes. . . I love the personalization they do with having my name on the TV screen & being greeted properly when I call the concierge or anywhere in the hotel. . . The beds are out of this world comfortable and the rooms are impeccably decorated & spacious. . . The specialty drinks are the best on the strip, the dining options are fantastic & the clubs continue to remain supreme! (XS is my favorite tho). . No trip to Vegas is complete without a visit to the spa for me & the one here does not disappoint. The downside is the price is definitely steep.. . I would legitimately live here if I could!
I surprised my boyfriend for his birthday on staying at this hotel since he's never been here.  The hotel it self is so beautiful inside and out that when you walk in all you want to do is look around and take it all in.  The decorations are beautiful with fresh flowers everywhere.  The casino and hotel itself is very clean everywhere you go.  As we checked in to get our room the gentleman that helped us was very nice and made sure that our check in process went very smoothly. When we got to the room it was beautiful!  The bed was very spacious and the bathroom was ginormous! It had a separate bath area, separate shower, separate bathroom, and 2 separate sinks and vanities which we need especially for the ladies and their hair products and makeup!! I could live in that bathroom if I wanted too!!! . . As for the casino they had a variety of games to choose from like table games, slots, and so much more.  The people at the roulette games were so very nice and helpful that they taught us how to play roulette and didn't mind me asking all those questions! Very informational on their part!!!  Around the casino they had many restaurants to choose from that you could eat and dine in.  They ranged from casual to fancy of course.. . We will definitely be coming back here to stay again!
This review is for the casino portion of the hotel. I was there on 8/20 and signed up for the Red Card. I was told that their system was down but that it would be up the next day. I went downstairs right before my flight to find out if the system was up and if our points from the previous night had posted. We were told that they did and that we qualified for all new member bonuses based on the pattern of our spending. I was offered four free meals. I askedabout using them the next time we returned, which I said would be for the Mayweather/Canelo fight. I was told that I had seven days to use them. I asked for an extension given the fact that the points system had been down the previous day. I even went up to the cashier at around 4am to see if it was up yet. We were told that no exceptions would be made.. . We will never return to this hotel again and will make sure that my boyfriend tells his company to put up their employees at another hotel. Why is it MY fault that YOUR system was down? I spent hundreds up dollars that night gambling but that meant nothing. They could have at least given me an extension on the meal vouchers until 9/1
Decided to stay at Wynn several months ago and overall my experience was pretty satisfying. First off, the hotel is high end and both the pubic spaces and the rooms themselves reflect this. Anyone who opts to stay there is gonna end up dropping some serious loot if they choose to dine at any of the restaurants. I did eat at their buffet and unforetunately was a little disappointed. I was honestly expecting more, and the crab legs, which are a must for me, were actually lacking flavor and weren't as big as I expected. I'm not cheap by any means, but their buffet is among the most expensive in town at 42 bucks and simply not worth it. Even the desserts were nothing to write home about. They do have a very nice happy hour though, where I gorged myself on another of my favorites: Oysters. The customer service was also top notch and that's a HUGE plus for me.
I have stayed here & Aria & Ican tell you this place beats Aria hands down!. Has a Asian, Indian- esq decor. Its very whimsical when you walk in. There is a huge hot air balloon decorated with fake flowers (that look real!) you walk under trees & lights perfect for romantic pictures! keep walking passed the casino & you will run into a carousel made of the same decor.. . As you start walking towards the casino next to the check-in area you can see a huge outdoor waterfall fountain framed with gorgeous trees, it is so serene. Unfortunately we never got to go outside to see it without a glass window dividing us, during the times we wanted it was closed.. . The room was above my expectations. The bathroom was so large (about half a room size of a NYC hotel!). Marble (assuming it is? it's beautiful, it's cold, it's real smooth stone!) adorns everything in it! There is also a nice tv in the bathroom & huge tub & huge separate shower.. . This is the first place Ive ever table gambled & the dealer was very nice in explaining what I am supposed to do in black jack, the waitresses are very kind & you don't have to wait long for a drink but the bartender didn't know how to make a salty dog  (thumbs down to that!) even when I said what it contained it still could not be created :( On the cool side I saw Sung Kang gambling not too far from my table & yes, he is just as hot in person as he is the Fast & Furious franchise!. . The Wynn has a nice club called Surrender it's nice but everybody is acts fake (but i think that's normal for the Vegas club scene!) & it was around $30 to get in. it's situated around a pool & I don't recommend gambling here! Yet the guest DJ was on point & we had fun dancing!
I have stayed at the Wynn two times now and it is def my first choice when it comes to hotels in Las Vegas. I hear a lot of people complain about it being at the end of the strip (this personally does not bother me since I find myself spending most of my time at XS Nightclub or other locations in the Wynn and Encore) but I think that allows them to take full advantage of the landscaping and property. You are visually stimulated by all the detail and work that has gone into creating such a lovely place such as the Wynn. . . The restaurants are top notch and the entire environment is clean and constantly well kept. The employees are friendly and helpful, tons of shows and shops to explore. Beautiful art work throughout the vicinity, Positive and well lit environment. I am 23 and feel safe to wonder this hotel by myself because I know there is a trustworthy employee in any direction. . . The Encore is more suitable for a younger crowd and the Wynn appeals more to an older age range, but as long as your dressed decently they are pretty welcoming to all.  . . The Wynn rooms are spacious with a large bathroom and a full snack and fridge bar THAT IS WEIGHT CENSORED so please do not touch things unless you actually consider purchasing it. The beds are EXTREMELY comfortable, cleaning service is outstanding, and the electronic controls for the lights, curtains etc. was quite entertaining. :). . The bathroom in our double bed suite room was very nice, with a convient door shutting off the toilet area making it easy for people to get ready and use the restroom as needed. Large bathtub, with a walk in shower next to it... Although I did not use the tub, the shower had well powered water at good temperatures. Hair & Body products provided in the shower were of good quality as well. . . I feel like the Wynn has everything I need, with that being said...I will return soon again. . . ** I do have to note that the Wynn along with everything in it can be pricy, but you get what you pay for.
three words to describe the Wynn, the masterpiece by Steve Wynn:. .                                       KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. . If you could die and end up in the casino-resort of your dreams, the Wynn is your destination. Everything is lavish and eloquent in this paradise. With retailers Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Cartier headlining the Wynn Esplanade to the famous SW Steakhouse and Lakeside Seafood, both ran by Chef David Walzog, providing excellent waterfall views for a romantic night out, Steve Wynn spares no expenses when it comes to providing pleasure for our eyes. . . The casino itself is beautiful itself with some of the best dealers working the strip.. . If you are staying at the Wynn over a weekend and not spending over $1000 for your room, dining and casino, then you are most likely not #wynning lol
This the best hotel in the world. Everything about the hotel is exceptional. The rooms are amazing. Well designed, spacious and beautiful. The casino is great and very fun. The shops are top notch. The restaurant are all amazing. The staff is very courteous and attentive. The pool is beautiful and fun. All the restaurants are great. Never had a bad meal. The spa is out of this world but very pricey. The night life is great.  The clubs are fun and the music is always awesome.
Winter in wonderland. Everything is so beautiful. Love all the decorations and colors. With thousands of ornaments and dozens of fully decorated trees, there truly is no place for Christmas like Vegas.
