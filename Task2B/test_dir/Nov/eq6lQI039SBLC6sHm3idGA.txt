Favorite pizza place! Their sicilian and white sauce pizza are so good!! A little pricey but totally worth your money. We had a little trouble finding it but it's on the third floor at the cosmopolitan.
This place is hidden.  I don't think we would have been able to find it without either 'stumbling' upon it or having read some of the reviews on here with directions. . . It's off the beaten path down a hall on the third floor? of the Cosmopolitan.  We went around 2am, waited just five minutes for a fresh slice of pizza.  The pizza was a great late night snack.. . This is a definite keeper.
While their pizza is very good, they very much earned their one star with their horrible customer service. We waited I the ridiculously long line to get to the counter and then be told it would be a 20-25 minute wait for a pizza. Eventually 45 minutes passed and still no pizza. When we asked what had happened, it was clear that they forgot to cook the pizza, but instead the manager insisted that all three of us misheard the actual quoted time of 50-55 minutes; now how he heard the quote better than three people standing directly in front of the cashier I do not know. . . I've had plenty of restaurants mess up my order and the difference always comes down to just being honest about the mistake. We get that you're busy, but don't disrespect your customers! We are locals and have recommended this place to many friends visiting, but not after being treated like this.
Omg I am definitely a pizza connoisseur being from Chicago and going to New York for the thin crust.. . This "secret" pizza joint in the Cosmopolitan is mouth watering beyond belief. We had the white slices (olive oil, garlic, mozzarella and ricotta). We also. had the sausage pepper and onion, and the sausage. These were to die for,. I even ate the "bones".. . Staying here isn't the greatest but the pizza is cheap and worth the trip!. . They even had old school pinball while we waited, so fun!!
My first review was: "Wow!  Just Wow!  Yes reader, you must go there.". . Apparently, Yelp wasn't satisfied with that and deleted my first review.  They told me I  needed more substance.  Well, sometime less is more.  And yes, Secret Pizza is just that damn good.  Quite frankly, you don't need to say much to know you just need to go there when you're in Las Vegas.  Period.
The pizza is a must every time you stay or visit the cosmopolitan. It is on the pricier side for a whole pizza but is all worth it's price. There isn't a sign for the pizza parlor but It's entrance is right be the elevator in front of the billiards table
A little hard to find. The name definitely fits. Excellent pizza. Decent price. Just be careful with the garlic salt shaker the holes are huge which makes it easy to ruin your slice. Will go back every time I'm in town.
Holy crap how can anyone give this place less than 5 stars. 5 stars 5 stars.  This place is called secret pizza for a reason it is hard to find but worth the search for sure.  The guy imports water from NYC to make it perfect.. . So this is amazing stuff, you must try it if you're a NYC pizza fan.  I usually just go plain cheese when in NYC as I love the purity of it, but he talked me into trying some with home made sausage and I wasn't disappointed.  I went back the next afternoon with a clear head and tried plain cheese (awesome) and mushroom (very good). . . It is sort of hard to find, it is on the 2nd floor near the east tower. Just ask once you get up stairs.
My friends and I were sitting around in the hot tub in our hotel trying to figure out what to eat for dinner when someone suggested "that secret pizza place near Marquee.". . "Oh, what's it called?". "I don't know. It's just the secret pizza place?". . Yes. Apparently it really is just called "Secret Pizza.". . I had always heard of Secret Pizza, but had never figured out exactly where it was. If you're searching for it, you will find it, but if you're just casually passing by, you probably won't even notice it's there. . . How to find it: Go to the Cosmopolitan. Find the entrance to Marquee and take the escalators one floor up. You should be smelling the deliciousness of freshly baked pizza by now. Straight across from the escalators there's a narrow corridor. Follow your nose. This is where the smell is coming from. This is where the secret pizza is hidden away.. . You'll probably spend a while stuck in the hallway, being taunted by the smell of ahmazing pizza wafting over you. When you turn the corner of the hallway, you'll be greeted by what looks like an ordinary pizza counter. But do not be fooled. . . You can get a slice of pizza for about $5, which is actually fairly decent since each slice is huge. And delicious (trust me, try the white sauce! Zomg. So gooooooood.) If you're trying to order an entire pie, beware, the wait is most likely going to be terrible. . . There's two TVs, which makes the wait somewhat more bearable. There's also barely any seating, so most people end up just dumping on the cheese and peppers and taking their slices to go. This seems to be the way to go because we grabbed a seat outside on the couches/stairs in front of Secret Pizza and someone had already snuck a cheese and pepper shaker outside.. . Also, for those who enjoy a little late night snacking post-Marquee adventures, Secret Pizza is the place to be. But again, the line, the line! Beware.. . tl;dr: If you're in Vegas and searching for a truly delicious piece of pie, Secret Pizza is the place to go. But beware the line! (Because for a secret pizza place, it sure is poppin')
I am a local and until last weekend (halloween weekend) I had never been to this place. BOY WAS I MISSING OUT! . . Price is so cheap and the pizza is amazing! Each of us ordered a slice and I got the white pizza with some pepperoni on top. Greasy and delicious. Hits the spot and is a little bit hidden so just ask someone where it is and enjoy. . . Service was great and will definitely be coming back here again. Five BIG STARS!
After years of clubbing at Marquee and having Secret Pizza bookmarked, I finally got the chance to eat here during my last Vegas trip in October. We'd gotten our stamps at Marquee and with re-entry privileges, we decided we didn't want to wait in the club for Porter Robinson to go on and should grab some food 'cause we were starving.. . The entrance of Secret Pizza is through a tiny hallway on the 3rd level of Cosmopolitan, in between this restaurant and elevator outside the Marquee ticket holder entrance and re-entry line. There was a short line at 11:30 pm, which moved quickly. I got a slice of NY-style Cheese and Craig P. went with a slice of deep dish. Tasty and pretty standard in terms of what you'd expect. Way later in the evening (morning?), some of my friends brought back an entire Secret pizza to the hotel for some amazing drunchies. Cold, but still very good!. . There's no seating, only standing room with counter tops along the wall for you to stuff your face. However, you can eat in the resting area right outside; there are plenty of sofas and chairs, as well as a free pool table.. . Great option if you're clubbing and hungry during or after.
Fabulous. Had the white pizza and spicy peperoncini with something I cannot remember. Both were some of the best pizza I have ever eaten.
I've been here twice, one time where the line was so long that I didn't have the patience to wait and the other time just this past weekend. I am glad I finally got to try the Secret Pizza because it was so worth it after a night of drinking!. . This place is hidden quite well, I wouldn't even know how to describe to someone how to find it.. . They have slices all ready to go for about $5 a slice. I got the white pizza, which had ricotta cheese and a nice garlicky flavor to it. I would get this again in a heartbeat. I also got a red sauce pizza that had sausage on it, again, another winner in my book.. . Love this place and I feel like I have another alternative to Earls if I need a late night bite!
Awesome pizza especially after a long night of partying. Good prices and been here multiple times. Good for taking out as well. Great great great atmosphere!
Best Pizza in Vegas!
Ate here twice post partying. Pizza is terrible. People only like it because they're all drunk. I prefer that noodle place in the Venetian instead for preventative hangovers.. Pizza cheese was runny and parts of the pizza dough wasn't cooked. And it's not all secret. Everyone knows about this place. Lines are long.
This place has ruined me for any other pizza. It was amazing!  Will stop everytime I'm in Vegas.
I don't know if it was the drunchies speaking but secret pizza has been one of the best pizzas I have ever tasted. It is a bit pricey if you order by the slice. It was my bf and I's first time, so we tried pepperoni, meatball and cheese. Surprisingly cheese was DELICIOUS and my favorite. So is the MEATBALL pizza. I thought it was sausage but it wasn't. lol. They had so much flavor to them. Pepperoni was ok. Not bad but I liked the other 2 more. I will definitely be coming back when I'm back in Vegas. I knocked off a star only because the pizza was extremely greasy. But it was SO GOOD.. Next time we will for sure get a whole box.
Although the pizza might be good, the lines at 2am are nuts and last forever. It's only pizza, hard to think you'll spend over an hour in this line.. . . Good food, just need to serve customers faster.
Trying to be NYC.... But still pretty good.  Not gonna find much better on the strip!
This place should be called "incredibly packed pizza" because that's what it is. . . Secret pizza was a lot better when it was actually a fucking secret. The 1st time I ever came here I was able to walk right in at 4am, get my pizza, high 5 my friends & get my drunk ass back to my hotel. Now you walk up and wait in a line for 45 minutes. . . All that annoyance aside, the pizza is actually good but you're definitely getting ripped off as a slice will run you a cool $5+ depending on toppings.. . They should limit how many pizzas 1 person can buy. MFers be walking out with like 5 pizzas with a line out the door & then trying to sell it for double the price outside.
The secret may be out but this location really is hidden and you might need a sherpa guide to find it. Head down the hall full of famous Italians once you get to the third floor and you're on the right track. Once you finally find it, the pizza is quite tasty (my NY born and raised approved) and even better after all the effort you made to find it. There wasn't a line on a late night visit during the week and I was able to play a game of pinball while I waited.. . Excellent pizza and worth the effort for a quick bite on the strip.
As I drunkly stumbled upon this place, there was no doubt that my nose had led me to this delicious pizza heaven. JK. But yes I was drunk,but a friend took us here. How could I call Vegas my backyard, if I barely just tried Secret Pizza!!. . From what I remembered, the line was quite long, wrapped around the corner, but it was good for me to sober up. The interior decoration was fun, a couple machines for people to kill time with while inhaling that greasy yet mouth watering smell of fresh pizza. As I walked closer to order, my eyes widened and spotted the server tossed a freshly made Mushroom pizza in the bottom pizza drawer, I yelled (I think I yelled), I want that! Oh yes, it was filled with lots of fresh mushrooms and great crust. Wish I had ordered more, but man, it was pricy, but you do get what you paid for. . . I am coming back again, hopefully more sober so I can actually take a decent picture and enjoy the pizza.
Nestled between some great restaurants, is an amazing gem, that is SECRET PIZZA!. . When you're looking for a snack, a late night bite or simply just because you want a great slice of NY style pizza, Secret Pizza is where it's at.. . I could have pizza from here everyday. It's always on my itinerary any time I go to Vegas.
Secrets, secrets, are no fun. Secrets, secrets, hurt someone... Unless they involved pizza. . . Want some pro tips? At $5/slice, that makes a pie $50, but guess what? Cheeze pie is $26! Want a consistent delicious pizza everytime you're at Secret? Get the pie! Even when I'm alone I get the pie because its fresh. I usually take walk on the Blvd and hookup some hungry faces with the remaining slices. Eat something great and do something great. . . Cowabunga!
We were in Vegas for the marathon. After running, my husband and I were looking for a place to eat so we looked up places through Yelp and found this place. This place had great reviews and pizza sounded like great food after running. We checked it out and it held up to the expectations that people wrote about. The staff were extremely friendly, we only waited maybe 5 minutes from the time we got in line until the time we paid (some reviews say it does get super busy later in the evening but we got there at a decent time), and the pizza was really, really good! My husband and I only got the cheese pizza but it was perfect for us - great cheese to sauce ratio (the sauce was delicious), great crust (good crunch throughout the whole pizza), and not a lot of grease. After eating here all my husband wanted everyday thereafter was pizza for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It really is a secret place. There are no signs but it is located on the third floor down a hallway across from the pool tables. The hallway is filled with pictures on the wall.
A tad over priced!  But fresh as hell and yummy!  NO WHERE to sit but gnarly hipster style and old school vibe!  I need to get two slices after a night of boozing at Vesper or BOND BAR!
the crust makes the pizza. crispy and friggin good. Well played secret pizza, well played.
Quite possibly the best New York style pizza you'll find on the West Coast. If you've dealt with sub-par NY pizza around town, come to this pizza place and you will not be disappointed.. . As you walk through the vintage Italian album collage leading to pizza paradise, you'll find a few gems - including an old San Remo cover - before finding your cheesy reward.  They use cornmeal to crisp the crust and the cheese is stringy and delish.  It feels like a pizza speakeasy amid so many trendy restaurants on that level inside Cosmopolitan, but well worth the mystery hunt to get there.
Great pizza, friendly and entertaining staff, and open late!
I loved this place! The pizza is yummy. You can take it to go...well tbh there isn't much room to sit. The staff is fast and friendly. I'm definitely going back on my next visit.
Seriously was meh at best! Don't  know how everyone makes such a fuss. It has no where to sit!!!
An awesome late night snack at 1 am!  On the second floor by the pool table Secret Pizza is a hidden gem.   There is no signage to highlight this pizza joint's location so it can prove to be difficult to locate the first time you look. . . The individual pizza slices are proportionally generously.  The pizza dough is ultra thin, and the combination of cheesy goodness and tangy tomato sauce makes this pizza mouthwateringly great!  . . I usually get the pepperoni.  It's a oldie but a classic!  If you can find this hidden treasure you'll discover this gem is well worth the tolls of the search!!!
