I decided to come and stay here for the Halloween week-end, I like to stay in a different place each time.. . The room was great overall but the lighting fixtures had minds of their own switching on and off. The top floors of the hotel only has a bank of 6 elevators for floors 47-61. This was a bad move when they built this property. I never have had to wait sooo long for the elevators.. . One more day/nite here but will not return, new place!!! Maybe the Wynn. Looks amazing!!. . Cheers
I loved loved LOVED my one bedroom fountain view suite on the 28th floor. The terrace with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountain with Paris and the strip in the background... It was amazing!!! I could sit in my Japanese soaking tub, look out the window and watch the fountain show. I could take a sexy shower with open see-through view from the bed. I had a full living room and kitchenette and the closets were plentiful for all of our nice clothes. Everything was clean and we had regular maid service. It was great! . . A little pricey but you can't get something half as nice here on Oahu where I live for the price we paid. The cost is fair and definitely worth it for the suite!!!. . The central location can't be beat. Walking distance to all the best hotels and casinos. Excellent dining choices on site. . . But the pools... Meh. This hotel caters to a younger crowd and I just felt like it was too dirty and crowded to go in. I sat on a lounge seat and drank a cocktail. . . The decor is beautiful. I mean that Chandelier is just so impressive and pretty. The shoe sculptures! The classic Hollywood! Wow. This hotel makes me think if Carrie Bradshaw was a hotel- she would be The Cosmopolitan. . . The clubs were incredibly busy and were THE place to be for all the club rats. Lots of activity. Great for the young, single crowd.. . I loved our stay and highly recommend!!
The Cosmo is SWANKY, but you pretty much get what you pay for.  My boyfriend and I stayed in a Terrace Studio with a fountain view and it was breathtaking!  The view of the strip from the balcony was unbeatable.. . Our room had a queen bed, two TV's, a kitchenette, and an awesome blue velvet L-shaped couch.  BUT WAIT, it also had a garden bathtub with whirlpool jets!  The decor was hip and contemporary, maybe even a little over the top, but it's Vegas so go with it!. . My only criticism is that there wasn't space in the mini-fridge for any of our own food/drinks and there wasn't a coffee maker.. . I would definitely stay here again.
Poor customer service.  They send me free rooms via email and through the mail and when I call to use them they want to charge mefor the rooms.  Total bait and switch.  Beware of this hotel and casino
First few drinks after checking in. Enjoying the game at the sports book bar. Terrance and Clyde are amazing. Cracking me up and keeping up with the patrons. Everyone is having a great time and these guys are providing the service I crave when I'm on vacation. On a side note... it's pretty rare to keep a smile on my face when a my team is losing.
Seems like everyone I talk with who's going to Las Vegas now stays at the Cosmopolitan.  . . There are some great things about it: . (1) If you're a frequent business traveler, you can use Marriott points here. (2) Wrap around balconies in the suites are awesome, and their views are phenomenal. (3) Some suites have mini kitchens and even washer/dryers!. (4) Central Strip location. . But, there are things I just don't like about the Cosmopolitan:. (1) Even 20 floors up, the beat of the nightclub was so loud until 5AM that I didn't get much sleep.  I know, I know... not supposed to sleep in Las Vegas anyway, but that should be by choice and not environment.  . (2) Casino floor is very small.  You'll very likely end up going elsewhere to gamble.  . (3) Have only tried a few Cosmo restaurants, but they weren't in the "blow your socks off" category the top ones on the Strip offer.. . If you have Marriott status, sure, I get it.  But, having stayed at nearly 20 properties on the strip, there are several places I prefer more.
Just spent my first night in this hotel and it was lovely. The rooms have beautiful touches, whimsical wallpaper inside the closet is probably my favorite little surprise. There are fun books also inside the room including one with topics for conversation starters, very clever. Wonderful whirlpool tub, open floor plan. Huge bathroom. Specialized lighting, the details that make these rooms so special just go on and on. Location is superb, walk to high end shopping, Bellagio, MGM Grand, Luxor, New York New York. Trendy and well done.
This was my first trip to vegas, I wanted a nice hotel, but wanted a little younger crowd then I thought the Bellagio might have. Honestly, this hotel is worth the cost. It's a modern hotel, two pools, and a very expansive casino. We stayed in the west tower and paid for a terrace view. The room was great, soft and comfortable bed, down comforter, marble bathroom sinks and massive shower, as well as bathtub. Good location in the middle of the strip, free parking, and nice view. The room does have a mini fridge, but there's little storage for things like leftovers and drinks as it is full of the typical costly minibar items. The staff was always helpful and friendly. I liked the Wicked Spoon Buffet, exceptional desserts and prime rib, the buffet was more expensive then the Bellagio but higher quality. I'll be staying here again.
Ultra modern and trendy feel.  Normally have great deals for identity program members.  Overall feel high end bar/club.
Overall a lavishly decorated, interesting, and fun hotel to stay at in Vegas! Beautiful interior and rooms as well - I had a large room on the 61st floor, with a sitting area, balcony, huge bathroom with jacuzzi tub, two TVs, fridge, sink, microwave, the works. The meeting facilities are also top notch as far as I could tell. Location is convenient as well, as you're basically right in the middle of everything. Final result is an awesome awesome hotel that I would stay at again, hands down, no questions asked!. . Some slightly negative things to mention as well though, brace yourselves -. . There was some noise from the club at night. I'm as much a of fan of bumping bass as the next guy, but it was a little loud until about 3am (and I was on the 61st floor and still hearing it!). I know some other Yelpers mentioned that as well, but it really didn't bother me that much. I put a fan on and went to sleep - come on, it's Vegas! . . My jacuzzi in my room was weird. Maybe I don't know how to use jacuzzis well, but mine would turn on in the middle of the night by itself. It sounded like a vacuum cleaner kicking on, and woke me up in the middle of the night two nights in a row. Not a huge deal - jumped out of bed, turned it off, went back to sleep. Maybe my room was haunted? Or odds are I just screwed up and put it on a timer or something. Who knows?. . My room was starting to show a little bit of wear and tear - carpet becoming a little worn, edges of the tables and desk getting a little nicked up. Just me being nitpicky though. It was still a beautiful room.. . I know the negatives got more space than the positives here, but make no mistake - I would consider myself lucky to be able to stay at the Cosmo again!
This is one of the newer hotels on the Vegas strip. It's super fancy and classy looking I'm sure everyone will love the sight of it! Few things I really enjoyed about this hotel is the restaurants, and the secret pizza spot which is open til late in the morning! Not to mention the decorations inside are beautiful, they make you feel like you surrounded by nothing but chandeliers and crystals all around you. You can also find the famous Marquee nightclub here as well. On another note they do have the wicked spoon buffet here but it's not too good, I would like to share with everyone to skip this buffet.
Came here to eat at the Wicked Spoon Buffet! The service I experienced at the buffet was amazing, from paying at the cashier for 2 adult buffet meals to our server Will!  When I was paying at the cashier before being seated, the woman asked if I was an Identity card member and if I would like to sign up for it? She said it was free and I signed up, she then added my transaction to the Identity card so I could get points after I filled out my information.  She handed me a temporary card and said I could go to the Identity card desk that is across from the escalator downstairs.  After we enjoyed our buffet lunch, we headed downstairs and the lady at the Identity desk was really nice helped us. She talked about how great the Wicked Spoon buffet was and that the Cosmo is owned by the Marriott Hotel Corperation.  . . The hotel is super modern and upscale. Its amazing and breathtaking the crystals everywhere is hella cool! I know Richard Marriott and I was glad I was able to come, since this hotel wasn't built yet the last time I was in Vegas in 2005!
My boyfriend introduced me to his favorite hotel on the Vegas strip, and I am now sold on it as well!  The rooms are spacious and perfectly laid-out with a large, luxurious bathroom, complete with jacuzzi tub and a HUGE shower.  The sitting area is large enough to accommodate a small sectional couch, the bed amazingly comfortable, and each room has a balcony (a rare touch in Las Vegas)!. . Some people complain that the casino is fairly small.  Personally, I prefer that as you don't have to walk and walk to navigate the hotel, unlike many other properties.  I also like the layout where the restaurants are above the casino.  It's convenient to check out all the dining options quickly.. . The Cosmopolitan is very centrally located on the Strip.  . . I'm counting down to my next trip!
Incredible rooms with awesome views of The Strip and sunset over Red Rock Mtns. Beautiful hotel.
The pictures of the casino that are posted on here are accurate to the reality of just how many people are inside gambling. Went inside on a Saturday night and it was seriously a ghost town. We counted 18 people on the floor playing table games. 10:30pm on a Saturday night. 18 people. The staff waiting at empty tables looked like they wanted to shoot themselves, just to end their misery. . This place cost 3.9 billion dollars to build. LOLOLOLOLOL- ouch. Good luck recouping that when no one is there on a Saturday night. We headed down the street and gambled at casinos where actual people were.
This hotel is classy!!  The pool is a little rowdy for my taste.  Some dude got pantsed in the pool and I felt like we needed to bathe in bleach.  Overall, the hotel rooms and bars are amazing.  Wish they had better food options.
This is one of the few hotels that I'll ever give five stars, and they absolutely deserve it. In this day and age of endless hotel options (especially in Vegas), you want to get the biggest bang for your buck and truly feel like you're being given top notch service. That is, after all, what staying in a hotel is all about. Well the Cosmo delivered in every way and made my trip to Vegas that much better.. . As soon as you walk in, you're in a upbeat mood. The desk clerks checked me in with record speed and couldn't have been more friendly and forthcoming with suggestions. All throughout the lobby, the entire place is immaculate and very modern chic. Plenty of bars to grab drinks as well as chairs to relax.. . Now, the rooms? Home run.. Best single occupancy hotel room I've ever stayed in. The value was second to none. Floor to ceiling windows, top notch amenities, modern decor, brand new spacious bathroom and a view that is probably the best you could get in Vegas. Literally a view of the entire strip. I was here for work on this go round, and this room made it hard to leave the room at times.. . . I've stayed at a few places in Vegas and this is by far the best.. Better than the Bellagio in my opinion. Awesome!
Gave us a room that was completely uncleaned then made us wait 30 mins for new room. No one came to apologize or offered to comp us or upgrade us. Not what you expect for a high end hotel on the strip.
We stayed at the Cosmo last weeek for our annual "staycation" we chose the wrap around suite, the view off the valcony is absouletly beautifull and very romantic when the fountains at the bellagio go off. the staff was amazing and our oveall stay was a 5 star expeience!!
This is one of my absolute favorite hotel to stay at when I am in Vegas. This hotel is meant more for singles or couples not very much groups or family. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. I stayed in a one bedroom Terrance suite. The room is absolutely amazing. I had a jacuzzi & patio which we saw the bellagio fountain show from our room. We had a mini living room as well. I loved my spacious room and cannot wait to stay here in the future.
Nice place, not a fan of the sports bar. Bartenders very rude to all customers who aren't female.. If they could provide some decent service and not act so entitled could easily be one of the best on the strip.
Loved it!!!!. From the minute we checked in and throughout our whole visit , everyone was extremely nice and welcoming .. The room we got was big and beautiful with many enmities .. Big bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and double sink.. A living room , a Kitchenet with a dishwasher , microwave and fridge.. Comfortable bass and modern design for the whole room with open space features and the best part was , the balcony .. It's the first hotel in Vegas that I've been in (and I go at least 3 times a year) with a balcony , facing the bellagio fountains (great site).. The buffet is great and the food is delicious .. Casino dealers are nice and welcoming (I actually left with some money in my pocket ).. I used to be a regular at the Mandalay bay , the cosmopolitan just got themselves a new regular customer.. See you soon!
Hands down one of my favorite hotels on the strip. Location is PERFECT, beautiful suites, and you can't beat the view from the balcony. We got a comp room for 2 nights in the East tower. We love the closeness of the parking elevators and just everything about the rooms and hotel. This is not a cheap hotel but this is definitely a great way to do Vegas right.
Met some friends at the STK bar upstairs. The hotel itself is drop dead gorg, and the people are too! . . I saw some of the best looking men and women in that bar! If I was younger and single, I'd be hanging out here...maybe...if I was into that scene. Everyone looked like they were dripping with money, so that is really not my scene. But if you're a gold digger, man or woman, this is the place!!
We stayed here for our Targa Trophy event. Got a discounted room which was nice.. I didn't have much expectations since it was a discounted room, but it was absolutely beautiful !. . We got the Terrace One Bedroom.. . Once you walk in, there is a living room with couch, coffee table, full work desk, flat screen TV and a kitchen with a full bar and snacks.. . As you pass the living room, you walk through a hallway with full closet on one side, and bathroom on the other side. The closet even came with separate shelves for laundry, shoes, and iron. The bathroom had its own slidable door. Came with two seperate sinks, seperate bathroom, make up mirror, and other amenities such as soap, lotion, tissues, cutips, and hair dryer.. . The shower was really unique, it was its own walk in room with a large clear glass door. In the middle was another short hallway with full shelves. And on the other end was a Japanese soaking tub. The tub was a bit on the small side but was nice because the hot water actually worked and didn't take a long time to heat up.. . The bed.... felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. King size pillow top mattress with feather down comforters and tons of pillows of all sizes! It was heaven. There are two end tables on each side with individual lamps. At the end of the bed, lays another flat screen tv. . . Lastly, we had a balcony that overlooked the strip. I thought it was really nice that they even had a small day bed outside with a table and a candle.. . Overall, it was one of the best rooms I've stayed in. It was just perfect. I could just live in that room. Lol.. . Only downfall was that when we were trying to check out of the room through our flat screen tv, there was a charge that said we used an item from the mini bar, when we did not use anything. So we had to go wait in line at the front desk in order to check out which took up some time.. . AND I didn't realize I had forgotten my make up bag until we got back home to San Diego which was very unfortunate. Luckily I was able to call the lost and found the next day and they had it in their possession. I was able to locate my missing make up bag quickly, but would've liked it better if they had called us as soon as they found it the night before, so that I could've picked it up while I was still in Vegas.. . But nonetheless, great customer service and quality.
Fabulous place to stay. It's gorgeous and has a good club inside. There are tons of good places to eat including a great pizza place in a small nook.. . Why 4 stars and not 5 stars?. . They charge an exorbitant amount for an extra fridge, same for coring a bottle for you.  Why the hell isn't it complimentary?? . . As well when we checked in, there was a pop can missing from the fridge when we got there and then the hotel proceeded to charge us for it at the end of our stay. $7 for a coke I never even drank?? Na ah!! So they took it off after I pointed it out on the bill.  . . The concierge checking us in was great. The one checking us out...couldn't do basic math. . . I would def recommend this place if it's in your vacay budget!
Once again, my experience was fantastic. The Cosmopolitan is nothing short of a fantastic resort. The staff, the gaming, the rooms are all first class. Thanks again Cosmo. I'll be back soon.
FRODO! One word- the one machine!. . Came here on thanksgiving and this is one of the nicest, most luxurious hotels, probably my favorite!. . I had so much fun coming here and playing the Lord of the Rings game with my boyfriend, his brother and family! The machine kept winning! So much 8 hours later we left at 6am! . . I will say service is hit or miss though. We found the sweetest lady named Kathy who asked us all if we had player cards which we didn't and she took our ids while playing and came right back with cards! Awesome!. . We did have a cocktail waitress, or a few. Some really were nice and efficient and as time went on the service really diminished. My boyfriend found a player card in a machine & went to return it only for a waitress to rudely say pretty much who cares "they can get a new one". Ruudddeee, (I think that one "magic" song when it comes to this, um "why you gotta be soo rudeee?").. . Nonetheless this place gets a 5 from me, still Cuz it's just so beautiful. I've been to their Marquee nightclub too and I've had loads of fun!. . This is a place to stop at in Vegas!
