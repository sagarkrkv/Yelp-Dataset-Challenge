Great Value but nasty casino employees.. I stayed from Oct. 26 to 29. .    PROS:   The check in was fast and the young lady was very pleasent.  The room was great for the price being a strip locataion.  It's not a 5 star room but since I don't spend much time in the room, a soft bed and clean bathroom was all I wanted.  The on site Pizza Parlor was surprisingly good and even gluten free pizza available. .    CON'S:  The  dealers on the craps table except for Billy, were just nasty.  They enjoyed the failures of anyone playing.  Laughing at one point when things were going poor.  The bar tender at the center bar had an attitude that since he has been there for 15 years, he was the s**t.  Don't bother asking him a question, he's too good to answer correctly.  The casino hosts had little or no time to answer my questions.  .   In all, I will stay in the hotel because of the price but I will NEVER gamble there again!
We booked a tower suite several months in advance. When we checked in, they said the only one available was smoking and that for suites you cannot specify. WHAT?! You can ask for non-smoking for a normal room but for an expensive suite you can't? I have asthma and was completely disappointed. When I called downstairs to see what they could do, they said that nothing was available and didn't even apologize. I was so upset and was coughing all weekend. Will be sure to stay elsewhere due to bad customer service and smelly room.
I personally like Treasure Island and have never had any problems. We have stayed here twice and have enjoyed our visits. For the price and location I think TI is a sure bet.  I also love the buffet and drink vouchers they provide to guests (bogo). . . I mean, I've stayed at some pretty high end places like the Wynn and obviously TI is not going to compare. You pay for what you get but I'd rather spend my money on food, gambling and shopping instead of a room that I use to keep my belongings in (and to shower). . . Clean. Decent price. Alright location. TI is a winner in my book!!
my husbands and mine  first time in vegas and as far as the hotel Goes, its great. My negative,which is a serious deal. Breaker for me is when something is not clean-(because i do hair, i  am licensed to touch, meaning i had to learn about ALL infection and sanitation and how to avoid spreading infection etc....) Once i walked in the bathroom i looked at the towels and saw light yellow crusty residue on the towel!!! I know what it is, just didnt want to say (barf) But looking at all the towels i could clearly tell, either the temperature on their dryers are not hot enough to kill bacteria. Or someone's not doing their job washing them with rthe correct temperature water :/ they did fix it after i called them but i was honestly disgusted. The headboard has wierd stains on it- just want to tell the housekeepers to pay extra attention and CLEAN!!!!  not just surface cleaning- but sanitize!! I hope the hotel teaches them about sanitation and disinfection. The tubs, the sheets, everything! It needs it. Our remit control also doesnt work. Womp.
Place has gone down hill. I have been going to Vegas for years for work. Staff is rude, rooms are not what they used to be. My $1500 room for 5 nights had no coffee, poor TV reception and channel selection. I could not even watch the game on TV. In April I stayed at the Areil and they give TI a lesson in quality. The restraints with the exception of the high price steak house left a lot to be desired. I walked to the plazzo and there was no contest in quality. I worked a show so I was not there to party or gamble and thank goodness. The other customers where complaining about the poor attitude of the staff. Management sets the tone for any business and I blame them. The thing that set me over the edge was to have to pay $1500 for 5 nights and then the wanted $19.95 a day for Internet ???? Even a hillbilly hotel would not stoop so low. I work for a large German company that visits Vegas often and I will be advising the entire staff to stay away. Give it back to the Mob! The understood customer service!!!
Great service. For a reasonable price. I like this hotel. The upgraded room is super nice
rooms good. buffet sucks even at 2 for 1 price. . Gilles food sucks. no stars. . coffee shop very good. . pool is okay.. $ 28.00 resort fee daily , every day. you pay. when you check out.
TI is not one of your new hotels on the strip, the place has been around for more than 25 years now but its still a decent place to stay and its located in the middle of the strip.  The rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable.  They have decent bath soaps and shampoo.  The cafe downstairs is ok, average price on the menu is about $15, never tried the buffet but from the looks of it, its just your ordinary buffet, nothing special.  The sports betting room is rather small, most of the room is filled with bench seating with only a few chairs on the side, a lot of people just stand around to watch the games.  Not a lot of people were playing the tables so a lot of them were not open when I went, poker rooms and crap tables were kinda dead too.
I always like staying at this hotel when I come to town. Its usually on the cheaper side compared to the other hotels and its in a good spot on the strip.
Sorry but I'm used to a bit more upgrades. Beds are comfortable but no coffee maker in our room.  Prices for room service are crazy...$16 for a grilled cheese sandwich plus an $8 delivery charge!  Problem with the vacation package we purchased through Southwest Airlines. (They suck!) and so the manager gave us a2 for1 on the buffet!  Woopee!!  I'm not a high roller here and I guess I never will be!
Came here for the Las Vegas Rock N Roll marathon, and this wasn't our first time to Vegas but our first time staying at Treasure Island!  Our friends usually stay here and it was their choice and the positives are 1) location, convenient to the Palazzo through the bridge 2) was convenient for the marathon, 3) has a big fitness room located inside the spa, 4) refrigerator in the room to store cold drinks, water, etc., 5) free bottled water during check-in at the front desk;  minuses are it's an older hotel, still has guards in front of the elevators for security and you need to show your hotel card to enter, casino is smaller than some of the newer hotels.  IF you get a package for the hotel, you can have a pass to the fitness room, 2 for 1 buffet voucher and 2 for 1 drink at one of the bars in the hotel.  There's a resort fee of $28 day for free internet access, newspaper, free boarding pass print out in the business center.  . . I think if you're looking for a good deal at a reasonable price, TI is the place.
While on the strip we typically stay at Treasure Island.  We have probably stayed there at least 4 times in the past couple of years.  After reading the latest reviews and considering there was a change in management I was very concerned about our stay. In fact, I actually tried to change hotels last minute but couldn't find any good, inexpensive options.  . . Our stay was very good and we didn't experience any of the problems other reviewers posted.  It was similar to all of our other stays with one exception...the cocktail service.  . . I declare the cocktail waitress "EXTINCT" at Treasure Island.  When you finally get one don't move from that area and tip well.  Last year we thought it was a fluke but it happened again this time.  So if you want free drinks please be prepared to wait.  . . We don't typically eat at TI because the menu prices are crazy high!  The only way to afford eating there is to use the coupons you get with your room.  Also you can get some decent Groupons to offset the high prices. . . The rooms are comfortable, clean and decently priced. The location is great and you can easily take the tram to Mirage.  Try to get a deal on the room because you have the option to waive resort fees and get the preferred check-in line.  We would definitely stay there again and the $20 trick does work here!
Recent reviews got me worried before i came to TI. However, my 2 night stay turned out okay. Checkin was fast and easy. The buffet food was not too bad for buy one get one free. service was nice. Room and hallway were clean.
Gather around little Yelpers, let me tell you about my stay at ye ol' Treasure Island. No, but seriously get ready to hear it.. . We had the penthouse suite here. Our room was beautifully decorated and looked real crisp. Being an all guys birthday weeknd, we wanted to go all out. As soon as entering the room, we immediately fired up the jacuzzi. And 10 minutes later there was water all over the floor due to my fellow comrade who thinks it's not a problem to cannonball indoors. The staff handled the situation pretty well actually. They hand soaked and air dryed the room while we were out and the room looked handy dandy when we returned that night.. . Being a fairly rowdy group, being loud was a given. Things got a little wierd for us two days in. Our room was the first room on the hall we were in, and they actually had a person standing by our room 24/7. I asked why was this necessary, but the staff all told me they were doing what they were told by the relief and higher class. I'm conviced they were keeping an eye on us.. The pool area was exceptional. I mean, it's not a Wet Republic or Cancun, but it's a decent place to lounge around and sun bathe. The music selection was a hit or miss. Some days it was hopping and popping with an actual DJ, and some days it was like they were playing a radio. The drinks are actually really overpriced, but it is Vegas, so you can't really blame them. Anywho, the crowd here was pretty laid back and it was pretty obvious that everyone was hungover. We had brought a handle of Jameson down with us and had our own personal bar going. This goes against the rules, and the staff gave us a warning, but didn't confiscate the bottle until the second warning, when the bottle was already finished. We had forgotten our swimming wear back in the room, and made the executive decision to jump into the pool in our boxers. We weren't escorted out of the pool area, so i'm assuming this is okay if anyone considers this in the future.. . The tables here are cursed, and do not pay out. Go somewhere else. No, but seriously, I had the worst luck on the tables. The cocktail waitresses returned fairly quickly with the water down drinks, and do not return to you if you don't tip them well. . . The restauraunt selection here isn't the best. They have one place here open 24 hours that serves food that any late night diner would. We ate here a couple early mornings, and the food is as good as any drunk person looking for a quick bite would expect. The staff at the said restaurant were a hit and miss. Some were cooperative while others gave us the evil eye. My buddy and I came here one morning after a night of painting the town red, and we actually fell asleep after we ordered our food. After miserably failing to wake us up, the staff stored our food away until we woke up. No, they didn't remake our food, but instead saved it for us. I would've said something to them about giving us food that was not fresh, but during my sleep, I actually lost my phone and one of the employees here found my phone on the floor and returned it to me once I woke up. A truly sincere gesture when in Sin City. The food wasn't that good by the way.. . I felt bad for the maid that was in charge of cleaning our room. The pad looked like a tornado flew through it. After the second day I started tipping any houskeeper that passed by our room and showering them with compliments. It was the least I could do. Our room was always clean after we returned from the daily escapades, with the linen being fully stocked and our bathroom presentably clean. Nothing was stolen or taken either. . . We ordered room service to go along with our pregame on one of the nights when we were getting ready. Aside from the aggressive lady that yelled at us because we took to long to order, the food was extroadinary. We ordered a bunch of finger food that cost us an arm and leg, but everyone was neatly wrapped and to my surprise, well prepared and cooked. . . Last but not least, the people in charge of customer service. We had initially asked for a room with a view of the strip, but we also really wanted a smoking room to hot box, but to our dismay, the only smoking room they had, did not have a strip view. So we ended up settling for the view of the not so infamous Trump Tower. My buddy who had initially booked the room, called customer service intoxicated, mind you. He complained to them about the hotel view we had and gave them a bogus story about how he was going to propose tomorrow night and needed a strip view. After speaking to many people he finally had a word with the manager who actually gave us a brand new penthouse with a strip view for our last day there. These people really made our trip memorable and cooperated with all our needs. . . I'm giving this place 4 stars because their are better places to stay at on the strip, but if you're not really trying to go all, this is not a bad hotel. It's also right next to the Wynn and Palazzo.
Nothing spectacular just average, the rooms were ok and semi-clean at least. Played some slots for about 45 mins and 60.00 later found out they were very tight at this place. The buffet was pretty good but overall there wasn't much to do at this hotel it's pretty low key.
